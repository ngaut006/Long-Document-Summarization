Appeal from the High Court of judicature, Bombay, in a reference under section 66 of the Indian Income tax Act, 1022.
K.M. Munshi (N. P. Nathvani, with him), for the appel lant. ' M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (H. J. Umrigar, with him), for the respondent. 1950.
May 26.
The judgment of the Court was delivered by MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN J.
This is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay in an income tax matter and it raises the question whether munici pal property tax and urban immoveable property tax payable under the relevant Bombay Acts are allowable deductions under section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act.
The assessee company is an investment company deriving its income from properties in the city of Bombay.
For the assessment year 1940 41 the net income of the assessee under the head ""property"" was computed by the Income tax Officer in the sum of Rs. 6,21,764 after deducting from gross rents certain payments.
The company had paid during the relevant year Rs. 1,22,675 as municipal property tax and Rs. 32,760 as urban property tax.
Deduction of these two sums was claimed under the provisions of section 9 the Act.
Out of the first item a deduction in the sum of Rs. 48,572 was allowed on the ground that this item represented tenants ' burdens paid by the assessee, otherwise the claim was disal lowed.
The, appeals of the assessee to the Appellate As sistant Commissioner and to the Income tax Appellate Tribu nal were unsuccessful.
The Tribunal, however, agreed to refer two questions of law to the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, namely, (1) Whether the municipal taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under 555 the provisions of section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act; (2) Whether the urban immoveable property taxes paid by the applicant company are an allowable deduction under section 9 (1) (iv) or under section 9 (1) (v) of the Indian Income tax Act.
A supplementary reference was made covering a third question which was not raised before us and it is not there fore necessary to refer to it.
The High Court answered all the three questions in the negative and hence this appeal.
The question for our determination is whether the munic ipal property tax and urban immoveable property tax can be deducted as an allowance under clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act.
The decision of the point depends firstly on the construction of the language employed in sub clause (iv) of sub section (1) of section 9 of the Act, and secondly, on a finding as to the true nature and character of the liability of the owner under the relevant Bombay Acts for the payment of these taxes.
Section 9 along with the relevant clause runs thus: (1) The tax shall be payable by an assessee under the head ' income from property ' in respect of the bona fide annual value of property consisting of any buildings or lands appurtenant thereto of Which he is the owner, . . subject to the following allowances, namely : (iv) where the property is subject to a mortgage or other capital charge, the amount of any interest on such mortgage or charge; where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the. amount of such charge; where the property is subject to a ground rent, the amount of such ground rent; and, where the property has been acquired, constructed, repaired, renewed or recon structed with borrowed capital, the amount of any interest payable on such capital; . . . "" It will be seen that clause (iv) consists of four sub clauses corresponding to the four deductions allowed 556 under the clause.
Before the amending Act of 1939, clause (iv) contained only the first, third and fourth sub clauses.
Under the first sub clause interest is deductible whether the amount borrowed on the security of the property was spent on the property or not.
There is no question of any capital or other expenditure on the property.
The expression ""capital charge"" in the sub clause cannot connote a charge on the capital, that is, the property assessed.
That would be a redundancy as the opening words themselves clearly indicate that the charge is on the property.
We are therefore of opinion that capital charge here could only mean a charge created for a capital sum, i.e., a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.
In 1933 the Privy Council decided the case of Bijoy Singh.
Dudhuria vs Commissioner of Income tax, Calcutta (1 ).
It was not an assessment under section 9 but an assess ment on the general income of an assessee who was liable to pay maintenance for his step mother which had been charged on all his assets by a decree of Court.
It was not a li ability voluntarily incurred by him but one cast on him by law.
The Privy Council held that the amount paid by him in discharge of that liability formed no part of his real income and so should not be included in his assessment.
Though the decision proceeded on the principle that the outgoings were not part of the assessee 's income at all, the framers of the amending Act of 1939 wanted, apparently, to extend the principle, so far as the assessment of property was concerned, even to cases where obligatory payments had to be made out of the assessee 's income from the property charged with such payments, and the second sub clause, namely, ""where the property is subject to an annual charge not being a capital charge, the amount of such charge"" was added.
It is this sub clause which the appellant invokes in support of its claim to deduction of the municipal and urban, property taxes in the present case.
In view of the opening words of the newly added sub clause, the expression ""capital charge"" also used therein cannot have reference to a charge on the property, and we think it must (1) I.L.R. 60 cal.
557 be understood in the same sense as in sub clause (1); that is to say, the first sub clause having provided for deduc tion of interest where a capital sum is charged on the property, this sub clause provides for a deduction of annual sums so charged, such sums not being capital sums, the limiting words being intended to exclude cases where capital raised on the security of the property is made repayable in instalments.
In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji (1), a Bench of the Bombay High Court considered the meaning of these words.
As regards ""annual charge,"" Beau mont C.J. observed as follows : ""The words, I think, would cover a charge to secure an annual liability."" Kania J., as he then was, said as follows : ""I do not see how a charge can be annual unless it means a charge in respect of a payment to be made annually."" This construction of the words has been followed in the judgment under appeal.
In Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Income tax (2) (the connected appeal before us), the Bench of the Allahabad High Court agreed with the construction placed on these words in the Bombay case, i.e., the words ""annual charge"" mean a charge to secure an annual liability.
It is therefore clear that there is no conflict of judicial deci sions as to the meaning of the phrase ""annual charge"" occur ring in section 3 (1) (iv) and the meaning given is the natural meaning of these words.
As to the phrase ""capital charge"", Beaumont C.J. in the case above referred to took the view that the words mean a charge on capital.
Kania J., however, took a different view and observed that he was not prepared to accept the sugges tion that a document which provides for a certain payment to be made monthly or annually and charged on immoveable property or the estate of an individual becomes a capital charge.
In the Allahabad judgment under appeal these (1) I.L.R. (2) I.L.R. 1944 All.
558 words were considered as not meaning a charge on capital.
It was said that if an annual charge means a charge to secure the discharge of an annual liability, then, capital charge means a charge to secure the discharge of a liability of a capital nature.
We think this construction is a natu ral construction of the section and is right.
The determination of the point whether the taxes in dispute fall within the ambit of the phrase ""annual charge not being a capital charge"" depends on the provisions of the statutes under which they are levied.
Section 143 of the City of Bombay Municipal Act, 1888, authorises the levy of a general tax on all buildings and lands in the city.
The primary responsibility to pay this property tax is on the lessor (vide section 146 of the Act).
In order to assess the tax provision has been made for the determination of the annual rateable value of the building in section 154.
Section 156 provides for the maintenance of an assessment book in which entries have to be made every official year of all buildings in the city, their rateable value, the names of persons primarily liable for payment of the property tax on such buildings and of the amount for which each building has been assessed.
Section 167 lays down that the assess ment book need not be prepared every official year but public notices shall be given in accordance with sections 160 to 162 every year and the provisions o+ the said sec tions and of sections 163 and 167 shall be applicable each year.
These sections lay down a procedure for hearing objections and complaints against entries in the assessment book.
From these provisions it is clear ' that the liabil ity for the tax is determined at the beginning of each official year and the tax is an annual one.
It recurs from year to year.
Sections 143to 168 concern themselves with the imposition, liability and assessment of the tax for the year.
The amount of the tax for the year and the liability for its payment having been determined, the Act then pre scribes for its collection in the chapter ""The collection of taxes.
"" Section 197 provides that each of the property taxes shall be payable in 559 advance in half yearly instalments on each first day of April and each first day of October.
The provision as to half yearly instalment necessarily connotes an annual li ability.
In other words, it means that the annual liability can be discharged by half yearly payments.
Procedure has also been prescribed for recovery of the instalments by presentment of a bill, a notice of demand and then distress, and sale.
Finally section 212 provides as follows : ""Property taxes due under this Act in respect of any building or land shall, subject to the prior payment of the land revenue, if any, due to the provincial ,Government thereupon, be a first charge . . upon the said build ing or land . "" It creates a statutory charge on the building.
Urban immove able property tax is leviable under section 22 of Part VI of the Bombay Finance Act, 1932,on the annual letting value of the property.
The duty to collect the tax is laid on the municipality and it does so in the same manner as in the case of the municipal property tax.
Section 24 (2) (b) is in terms similar to section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act.
It makes the land or the building security for the payment of this tax also.
For the purposes of section 9 of the Indian Income tax Act both these taxes, namely, the munici pal property tax as well as the urban immoveable property tax are of the same character and stand on the same foot ing.
Mr. Munshi, the learned counsel for the appellant con tended that both the taxes are assessed on the annual value of the land or the building and are annual taxes, although it may be that they are collected at intervals of six months for the sake of convenience, that the income tax itself is assessed on an annual basis, that in allowing deductions all payments made or all liabilities incurred during the previ ous year of assessment should be allowed and that the taxes in question fell clearly within the language of section 9 (1) (iv).
The learned Attorney General, on the other hand, argued that although the taxes are assessed for the year the liability to pay them arises at the beginning 560 of each half year and unless a notice of demand is issued and a bill presented there is no liability to pay them and that till then no charge under section 212 of the Act could possibly arise and that the liability to pay being half yearly in advance, the charge is not an annual charge.
It was also suggested that the taxes were a capital charge in the sense of the property being security for the payment.
We are satisfied that the contentions raised by the learned Attorney General are not sound.
It is apparent from the whole tenor of the two Bombay Acts that the taxes are in the nature of an annual levy on the property ' and are assessed on the annual value of the property each year.
The annual liability can be discharged by half yearly instalments.
The liability being an annual one and the property having been subjected to it, the provisions of clause (iv) of sub sec tion (1) of section 9 are immediately attracted.
Great emphasis was laid on the word""due"" used in section 212 of the Municipal Act and it was said that as the taxes do not become due under the Act unless the time for the payment arrives, no charge comes into existence till then and that the charge is not an annual charge.
We do not think that this is a correct construction of section 212.
The words ""property taxes due under this Act"" mean property taxes for which a person is liable under the Act.
Taxes payable during the year have been made a charge on the property.
The liability and the charge both co exist and are co exten sive.
The provisions of the Act affording facilities for the discharge of the liability do not in any way affect their true nature and character.
If the annual liability is not discharged in the manner laid down by section 197, can it be said that the property cannot be sold for recovery of the whole amount due for the year ? The answer to this query can only be in the affirmative, i.e., that the proper ty is liable to sale.
In Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedbhoy Rowji(1) Beaumont C.J., while rejecting the claim for the deduction of the taxes, placed reliance on (1) I.L.R. 561 section 9 (1) (v) which allows a deduction in respect of any sums paid on account of land revenue.
It was observed that land revenue stands on the same footing as municipal taxes and that as the legislature made a special provision for deduction of sums payable in regard to land revenue but not in respect of sums paid on account of municipal taxes that circumstance indicated that the deduction was not allowable.
For the same purpose reference was also made to the provi sions of section 10 which deal with business allowances and wherein deduction of any sum paid on account of land reve nue, local rates or municipal taxes has been allowed.
In the concluding part of his judgment the learned Chief Jus tice said that it was not necessary for him to consider what the exact meaning of the words was and that it was suffi cient for him to say that it did not cover municipal taxes which are made a charge on the property under section 212 of the Bombay Municipal Act.
Without determining the exact meaning of the words used by the statute it seems to us it was not possible to arrive at the conclusion that the taxes were not within the ambit of the clause.
It is elementary that the primary duty of a Court is to give effect to the intention of the legislature as expressed in the words used by it and no outside consideration can be called in aid tO find that intention.
Again reference to clause (v) of the section is not very helpful because land revenue is a charge of a paramount nature on all buildings and lands and that being so, a deduction in respect of the amount was mentioned in express terms.
Municipal taxes, on the other hand, do not stand on the same footing as land revenue.
The law as to them varies from province to province and they may not be necessarily a charge on property in all cases.
The legis lature seems to have thought that so far as municipal taxes on property are concerned, if they fall within the ambit of clause (iv), deduction will be claimable in respect of them but not otherwise.
The deductions allowed in section 10 under the head ""Income from business"" proceed on a different footing and a construction of section 9 with the aid of section 10 is apt to mislead.
562 Kania J. in the above case in arriving at his conclusion was influenced by the consideration that these taxes were of a variable character, i.e., liable to be increased or re duced under the various provisions of the Municipal Act and that the charge was in the nature of a contingent charge.
With great respect, it may be pointed out that all charges in a way may be or are of a variable and contingent na ture.
If no default is made, no charge is ever enforceable and whenever there is a charge, it can be increased or reduced during the year either by payment or by additional borrowing.
In Moss Empires Ltd. vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (1) it was held by the House of Lords that the fact that certain payments were contingent and variable in amount did not affect their character of being annual payments and that the word, ""annual"" must be taken to have the quality of being recurrent or being capable of recurrence.
In Cunard 's Trustees vs Inland Revenue Commissioners (2) it was held that the payments were capable of being recur rent and were therefore annual payments within the meaning of schedule D, case III, rule 1 (1), even though they were not necessarily recurrent year by year and the fact that they varied in amount was immaterial.
The learned Attorney General in view of these decisions did not support the view expressed by Kania J. Reliance was placed on a decision of the High Court of Madras in Mamad Keyi vs Commissioner of Income tax, Madras(3), in which moneys paid as urban immoveable property tax under the Bombay Finance Act were disallowed as inadmis sible under section 9 (1) (iv) or 9 (1) (v) of the Indian Income tax Act. 'This decision merely followed the view expressed in Commissioner of income tax, Bombay vs Mahomedb hoy Rowji (4)and was not arrived at on any independent or fresh reasoning and is not of much assistance in the deci sion of the case.
The Allahabad High Court (1) (2) [1948] 1 A.E.R. 150. (3) I.L.R. (4) I.L.R. 563 in Gappumal Kanhaiya Lal vs Commissioner of Incometax (1) (the connected appeal) took a correct view of this matter and the reasoning given therein has our approval.
The result is that this appeal is allowed and the two questions which were referred to the High Court by the Income tax Tribunal and cited above are answered in the affirmative.
The appellants will have their costs in the appeal.
Appeal allowed.
","The charge created in respect of municipal property tax by section 212 of the City of Bombay Municipal Act, 1888, is an ""annual charge not being a capital charge"" within the mean ing of section 9 (1) (iv) of the Indian Income tax Act, 199.2, and the amount of such charge should therefore be deducted in computing the income from such property for the purposes of section 9 of the Indian Income tax Act.
The charge in respect of urban immoveable property tax created by the Bombay Finance Act, 1939 is similar in character and the amount of such charge should also be deducted.
The expression ""capital charge"" in s.9(1) (iv) means a charge created for a capital sum,that is to say, a charge created to. ' secure the discharge of a liability of a capi tal nature; and an ""annual charge"" means a charge to secure an annual liabili ty. 554

107 834 Appeal from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Judi cature at Patna in Appeal from Appellate Decree No. 97 of 1946 (Mannohar Lall and Mukherji JJ.) dated 23rd Decem ber, 1947, confirming the judgment of the District Judge of Purulia in Appeal No. 159 of 1944.

N.C. Chatterjee and Panchanan Ghosh (Chandra Narayan Naik, with them) for the respondent. 1950.
December 1.
The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.
This appeal arises out of a suit brought by the respondent in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Dhanbad, for recovery of arrears of royalty and cess from the appellant and another alleged to be due under a compromise decree passed on the 6th March, 1923, in a previ ous suit between the predecessors in interest of the par ties.
The only plea which is material for the purpose of this appeal is that the compromise decree not having been registered was inadmissible in evidence.
The courts below held that the document did not require registration and gave effect to its terms in decreeing the suit.
The second defendant has preferred this appeal.
The facts are not now in dispute and may be briefly stated.
On 11th March, 1921, one Kumar Krishna Prasad Singh (hereinafter referred to as Kumar) granted a perma nent lease of the right to the underground coal in 5,800 bighas of land belonging to him to Shibsaran Singh and Sitaram Singh (hereinafter referred to as the Singhs) by a registered patta stipulating for a salami of Rs. 8,000 and royalty at the rate of 2a.
per ton of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 8,000 and for certain other cesses and interest.
On 7th June, 1921, Kumar executed another perma nent patta leasing the right to the coal in 500 bighas out of the 5,800 bighas referred to above to one Prayngji Bal lavji Deoshi and his son Harakchand Deoshi (hereinafter referred to as the Deoshis).
By this document.
835 the Deoshis agreed inter alia to pay royalty at the rate of 2a. per ton on all classes of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 750 a year.
The Singhs feeling themselves aggrieved by the latter transaction brought a title suit (No. 1291 of 1921) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhanbad for a declaration of their title and for possession of the 500 bighas leased to the Deoshis under the aforesaid patta of 7th June, 1921.
To that suit Kumar was made a party as defendant No. 3, the Deoshis being defendants 1 and 2.
The suit was however cornpromised on 6th March, 1923, by all the parties and a decree based on the compromise was also passed on the same day.
The interest of the Singhs was brought to sale in 193S in execution of a decree obtained against them and was purchased by the plaintiff who insti tuted the presnt suit on 3rd October, 1942, claiming the royalty and cesses payable under the compromise decree for the period from Pous 1345 to Asadh 1349 B.S. from defendants 1 and 2 as the representatives of the Deoshis who entered into the compromise of March, 1923.
In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties, it is necessary to set out the relevant terms of the compro mise decree which are as follows : ""The plaintiffs (the Singhs) within two months from this date shall pay Rs. 8,000 as salami to defendant No. 3 (Kumar).
Otherwise all the terms of the compromise Will stand cancelled and the plaintiffs shall not be competent to claim any right to or possession over the.land covered by the patta dated 11th March, 1921.
The patta which defend ant No. 3 executed in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of 5,800 bighas of coal land in village Rahraband shall remain in force, and the plaintiffs will get a decree of declara tion of their right and title to the 500 bighas of coal land in dispute but defendants 1 and 2 (the Deoshis) shall hold possession as tenants.
Besides the terms mentioned below, defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound by all the remaining terms under which they took settlement of the 500 bighas of coal land from defendant No. 3 under 836 patta and Kabuliyat, and both the defendants 1 and 2 shall possess the same under the plaintiffs from generation to generation and all the terms of the said patta and Kabuliyat shall remain effective and in force between them.
Both the defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound to pay to the plain tiffs commission at the rate of 2a.
per ton on all sorts of coal instead of 2a.
a ton as stated before in the patta of 5,800 bighas of land settled with the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs shall pay to defendant No. 3 in future the mini mum royalty of Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 as stipulated in the original patta of 11 th March 1921 and commission at the rate of la.
a ton in place of 2a.
a ton as stipulat ed in the patta of March 21 .
Unless the plaintiffs pay to the defendant No. 3 Rs. 8,000 within 2 months from this day they shall not be competent to take out execution of this decree, nor shall they be competent to take posses sion of the land in dispute.
The defendants 1 and 2 within one month from the date of payment of Rs. 8,000 as aforesaid to defendant No. 3 shall execute a new Kabuliyat in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the modified terms stated above, i.e., on the condition to pay commission at the rate of 2a.
per ton.
In the new patta which defendant No. 3 will execute in favour of the plaintiffs he shall embody the condition that the annual minimum royalty will be Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 and commission will be at the rate of la. 9p.
per ton in place of 2a.
per ton as mentioned in the aforesaid patta.
If the defendant No. 3 does not execute the parts on the aforesaid modified terms in favour 'of the plaintiffs within the time aforesaid and both the defendants 1 and 2 also do not execute a kabuliyat on the aforesaid modified terms, then this very rafanama shall be treated as the parts and kabuliyat, and the plaintiffs in accordance with the terms of the rafanama shall pay to defendant No. 3, Rs. 6,000 only as minimum royalty and commission at the rate of la.
per ton with respect to 5,800 bighas and shall continue to realise commission at the rate of 2a. 6p. per ton from defendants 1 and 2 who shall remain bound to pay the same.
"" 837 The answer to the question whether this compromise decree requires registration depends on the legal effect of the changes in the status quo ante of the parties brought about by the document.
A careful analysis reveals the following alterations : (1) In the lease to the Singhs, the rate of royalty or commission was reduced from 2a.
per ton of coal raised to la.
per ton and the minimum royalty was reduced from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 6,000 while the area of coal land in their khas possession was reduced by 500 bighas. (2) In the lease to the Deoshis the rate of royalty or commission was enhanced from 2a.
per ton to 2a.
per ton and tiffs was made payable to the Singhs.
The Singhs and the Deoshis were brought into a new legal relationship, the former accepting the latter as tenants holding the disputed 500 bighas under them in consideration of the latter agreeing to pay the enhanced royalty to the former. (4) The whole arrangement was made conditional on the Singhs paying Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months from the date of the compromise, it being expressly provided that the Singhs were not to be entitled to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed area of 503 bighas which evidently had not till then passed into their possession.
Now, sub section (1) of section 17 of the , enumerates five categories of documents of which regis tration is made compulsory which include"" (d) leases of immoveable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent;"".
Sub sec tion (2) however provided that ""nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub section (1)applies to . (vi) any decree or order of court.
"" It may be mentioned in passing that this clause was amended with affect from the 1st April, 1930, by the , so as to exclude from the scope of the exception compromise decrees comprising immovable property other than that which is the subject matter of the suit.
But 838 the amendment cannot affect the document here in question which came into existence in 1923.
Before the amendment, the clause was held to cover even compromise decrees comprising immovable property which was not the subject matter of the suit: [Vide Hemanta Kumari Debi vs Midnapur Zamindari Co. ( ')].
That decision applies to the present case and obviates the objection that because the compromise in question covered also the remaining 5,300 bighas which were not the subject matter of the title suit of 1921, it was outside the scope of the exception in sub section (2), clause (vi).
The only question, therefore, is whether the compromise decree is a ""lease"" [which expression includes ""an agreement to lease"" by the definition in section 2 (7)] within the meaning of el.
(d) of sub section (1).
It is obvious that if the compromise decree fails within clause (d) of sub section (1) it would not be protected under clause (vi) of sub section (2) which excepts only documents falling under the categories (b) and (c) of sub section (1).
The High Court was of opinion that, on a proper construction of the terms of the compromise, it did not fall under clause (d).
Mano har Lall J., who delivered the leading judgment, observed: ""It was a tripartite agreement embodied in the decree of the court and was, therefore, exempt from registration.
It will be oh.served also that so far as the defendants were con cerned, their possession of the 500 bighas was not inter fered with and they still remained in possession as the lessees, but instead of paying the royalty to the plaintiffs it was agreed between all the parties that the defendants would pay the royalty in future to Shibsaran and Sitcram.
If the matter had stood there, the learned Advocate for the appellant could not have seriously contested the position, but he vehemently argued that when the agreement was not to pay the same amount of royalty or commission as previously agreed to but an altered amount of royalty and commission, the document should be held to fall within the mischief of section 17 (1)(d)of the (1) P.C. 839 .
The answer to this contention is, as I have stated just now, to be found in the Full Bench decision of this court :"" [see Charu Chandra Mitra 's case ()].
It was there held that a mere alteration of the rent reserved does not make the transaction a new lease so as to bring it within clause (d)of subsection (1).
We are unable to share this view.
It oversimplifies the compromise transaction which, in our opinion, involves much more than a mere alteration of the royalties stipulated for in the previous pattas executed by Kumar.
Nor can we accept the suggestion of Mr. Chatterjee for the respondents theft the compromise operated as an assignment to the Singhs by Kumar of the latter 's reversion under the ""lease granted to the Deoshis and all that the latter did was to acknowledge the Singhs as their landlords and attern to them.
On tiffs view it was said that the transaction would not fall under clause (d), although it would fall under clause (b) but then would be saved by the exception in clause (vi) of sub section (2).
The argument, however, overlooks that Kumar had leased the area of 5,800 bighas to the Singhs by his patta dated 11th March, 1921, and the compromise by providing that the Singhs should pay the reduced royalty of 1a.
per ton in respect of the whole area preserved Kumar 's reversion intact.
He could not therefore be deemed to have assigned any part of his inter est in 5,800 bighas as landlord to the Singhs who continue to hold the entire extent as tenants under him.
What the compromise really did was.
as stated already, to bring the Singhs and the Deoshis into a new legal relationship as underlessor and under lessee in respect of 500 bighas which were the subject matter of the title suit; in other words, its legal effect was to create a perpetual underlease be tween the Singhs and the Deoshis which would clearly fall under clause (d) but for the circumstance that it was to take effect only on condition float the Singhs paid Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months (1) 840 thereafter.
As pointed out by the Judicial Committee in Hemanta Kumar 's case (1) ""An agreement for a lease, which a lease is by the statute declared to include, must, in their Lordships ' opinion, be a document which effects an actual demise and operates as a lease .
The phrase which in the context where it occurs and in the statute in which it is found, must in their opinion relate to some document which creates a present and immediate interest in the land.
"" The compromise decree expressly provides that unless the sum of Rs. 8,000 was paid within the stipulated time the Singhs were not to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed property.
Until the payment was made it was impossible to determine whether there would be any under lease or not.
Such a contingent agreement is not within clause (d) and although it is covered by clause (b). is excepted by clause (vi) of sub section ( '2).
We therefore agree with the conclusion of the High Court though on dif ferent grounds and dismiss the appeal with costs.
Appeal dismisseel.
","An agreement for a lease, which a lease is by the Indian declared to include, must be a document which effects an actual demise and operates as a lease.
It must create present and immediate interest in land.
Where a litigation between two persons A and B who claimed to be tenants under C was settled by a compromise decree the effect of which was to create a perpetual underlease between A and B which was to take effect only on condition that A paid Rs. 8,000 to C within a fixed period: Held, that such a contingent agreement was not ""a lease"" within el.
(a) of section 17 (t) of the Indian , and even though it was covered by cl.
(b) of the said sec tion it was exempt from registration under el.

100.txt,"iminal Appeal No. 40 of 1951, 127 Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated the 1st June, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature in Assam (Thadani C.J. and Ram Labhaya J.,) in Criminal Reference No. I of 1951, arising out of Judgment and Order dated the 15th November, 1950, of the Court of the Additional District Magistrate, Lakhimpur, in Case No. 1126C of 1950.
Jindra Lal for the appellant.
Nuruddin Ahmed for the respondent.
October 23.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
Rameshwar Bhartia, the appellant, is a shopkeeper in Assam.
He was prosecuted for storing paddy without a licence in excess of the quantity permitted by the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947.
He admitted storage and possession of 550 maunds of paddy, but pleaded that he did not know that any licence was necessary.
The 'Additional District Magistrate recorded a plea of guilty, but imposed him a fine of Rs. 50 only, as he considered his ignorance of the provisions of the Food Grains Control Order to be genuine.
The stock of paddy was left in the possession of the appellant by the Procurement Inspector under a Jimmanama or security bond executed in his favour.
He was subsequently unable to produce it before the court, as the whole of it was taken away by a Congress M.L.A. for affording relief to those who suffered in the earthquake, and so, the appellant was ordered to procure a similar quantity of paddy after taking an appropriate licence, and to make over the same to the procurement department payment of the price.
The District Magistrate, being moved to do so by the procurement department, referred the case to the High Court under section 438, Criminal Procedure Code, for enhancement of the sentence, as in his opinion the sentence was unduly lenient and the Jimmanama, which was admittedly broken, should have been forfeited.
128 The reference was accepted by the High Court, and the sent ence was enhanced to rigorous ' imprisonment for six months and a fine of Rs. 1,000.
As regards the Jimmanama, the case was sent back to the trial court for taking action according to law under section 514, Criminal Procedure Code, for its forfeiture.
The appellant applied to the High.
Court for a certificate under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution that the case was a fit one for appeal to this Court.
This application was granted.
Out of the three points urged for the appellant, two were rejected, but the third one was accepted as a good ground, namely, that there was a contravention of the provisions of section 556, Criminal Procedure Code and that consequently the, trial before the Additional District Magistrate was void.
One of the contentions urged before us was that Shri C.K. Bhuyan was not a ""Director"" at all and therefore there was no valid sanction under section 38 of the Order.
A notifications dated 16th May) 1950, and published in the Assam Gazette of the 24th May, 1950, was produced before us to show that Sri C.K. Bhuyan was an Additional Deputy Commissioner and it was conceded by the appellant 's counsel before the High Court that if he was a Deputy Commissioner, he would be a Director under the Order, as all Deputy Commissioners in Assam were notified as Directors for the purposes of the Order.
Mr. Jindra Lal sought to draw a distinction between a Deputy Commissioner and an Additional Deputy Commissioner in this respect, but there is no warrant for the same,, apart from the circumstance that it is a question of fact which has to be investigated afresh, and which we cannot allow to be raised now for the first time.
The primary question to consider in this appeal is whether there has been any infringement of Section 556, Criminal Procedure Code, and a consequent want of jurisdiction in the court which tried the offence.
The facts relevant to this question lie 129 within a narrow compass.
The Procurement Inspector sent a report , Ist July,1950 about the nature of the offence ; he wrote out a short note the, subject, and requested that the accused might be prosecuted and the Assistant Director of Procurement, Dibru garh, might be authorised to dispose of the paddy immediately to avoid loss due to deterioration, Sri 0.
K. Bhuyan,who was the then District Magistrate Lakhimpur, made the following order: ""Prosecution sanctioned under section 7 (1) of ,the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, for violation of sections 3 and 7 of the Assam Food Grains Oontrol Order, 1947.
"" The case happened to be tried by the same gentleman in his capacity as Addtional District Magistrate, and the accused was convicted as aforesaid.
The argument for the appellant was that having sanctioned the prosecution, Sri C.K. Bhuyan became ""personally interested"" in the case within the meaning of section 556, and was therefore incompetent to try the same.
It was contended that the trial was not only irregular but illegal.
There is no question that ""personal interest"" within the meaning of the section is not limited to private interest, and that it may well include official interest also.
But what is the extent of the interest which will attract the disability is a subject which different views are possible and have been taken.
Section 556 itself indicates the difficulty.
The Explanation to the section runs in these terms: ""A Judge or Magistrate shall not be deemed a party, or personally interested, within the , meaning of this section, to or in any case by reason only that be is a Municipal Commissioner or otherwise concerned therein in a public capacity, or by reason only that he has viewed the place in which an offence, is alleged to have been committed, or any other place .in which any other transaction material to the case 'is alleged to have occurred, and made an inquiry III connection with the case.
"" 130 This shows that to be connected with a case in a public capacity is not by itself enough to render the person incompetent to try it.
Even if he had made an enquiry in connection with this case, it would not matter.
But look at the illustration: ""A, as collector, upon consideration of information furnished to him, directs the prosecution of B for a breach of the excise laws.
A is disqualified from trying this case as a Magistrate.
"" It is evident from the words of the illustration that if a prosecution is directed by a person in one capacity, he shall not try the case acting in another capacity as a Magistrate.
The explanation and illustration lend some support to the view that there is a distinction between a passive interest and an active interest, and that it is only in the latter case that the disqualification arises or intervenes.
Under sub section (3) (a) of section 2 of the Assam Food Grains Control Order ""Director"" means ""the Director of Supply, Assam, and includes, for the purpose of any specific. provision of this Order, any other officer duly authorised in that behalf by him or by the Provincial Government by notification in the Official Gazette.
"" Section 38 provides: No prosecution in respect of an alleged contravention of any provision of this Order shall be instituted without the sanction of the Director.
"" A little confusion is likely to arise from the employment of the word "" Director"" in the Control Order and the word ""directs"" in the illustration to section 556 of the Code '.
It has to be borne in mind that a sanction by the Director within the meaning of the Code does not necessarily mean ""a direction given by him that the accused should be prosecuted.
"" In both cases of sanction and direction, an application of the mind is necessary, but there is this essential difference that in the one case there is a legal impediment to the prosecution if there be no sanction, and in the other case, there is a positive order that 131 the prosecution should be launched.
For a sanction, all that is necessary for one to be satisfied about is the existence of a prima facie case.
In the case of a, direction, a further element that the accused deserves to be prosecuted is involved.
The question whether a Magistrate is personally interested or not has essentially to be decided the facts in each case.
Pecuniary interest, however small, will be a disqualification but as regards other kinds of interest, there is no measure or standard except that it should be a substantial one, giving rise to a real bias, or a reasonable apprehension the part of the accused of such bias.
, The maxim "" Nemo debet esse judex in propria sua causa"" applies only when the interest attributed is such as to render the case his own cause.
The fulfllment of a technical requirement imposed by a statute may not, in many cases, amount to a mental satisfaction of the truth of the facts placed before the officer.
Whether sanction should be granted or not may conceivably depend upon consideration extraneous to the merits of the case.
But where a prosecution is directed, it means that the authority who gives the direction is satisfied in his own mind that the case must be initiated.
Sanction is in the nature of a permission while a direction is in the nature of a command.
Let us now examine some of the decisions the subject.
For the appellant, strong reliance was placed the judgment of the Privy Council in Gokulchand Dwarkadas vs King(1), and it was argued the basis of some of the observations of the Judicial Committee that a sanction was an important and substantial matter and not a mere formality.
The facts in that case were that while there was a sanction of the Government for a prosecution under the Cotton Cloth and Yarn Control, Order, there was nothing in the sanction itself, or in the shape of extraneous evidence, to show that the sanction was accorded after the relevant facts were placed before the sanctioning authority.
To quote their Lordships ' own words; (1) (1948) 52 C.W.N.325.
132 ""There is no evidence to show that the report of the Sub Inspector to the District Superintendent of Police, which was not put in evidence, was forwarded to the District Magistrate, nor is there any evidence is to the contents of the endorsement of the District Magistrate, referred to in the sanction, which endorsement also was not put in evidence.
The prosecution was in a position either to produce or to account for the absence of the 'report made to the District Superintendent of Police and the endorsement of the District Magistrate referred to in the sanction, and to call any necessary oral evidence to supplement the documents and show what were the facts which the sanction was given.
"" It is in this connection that their Lordships em phasise that the sanction to prosecute is an important step constituting a condition precedent, and observe: ""Looked at as a matter of substance it is plain that the Government cannot adequately discharge the obligation of deciding whether to give or withhold a sanction without a knowledge of the facts of the case.
Nor, in their Lordships ' view, is a sanction given without reference to the facts constituting the offence a compliance with the actual terms of clause 23.
"" This, however, is no authority for the position that a sanction stands the same footing as a direction.
It is true that the facts should be known to the sanctioning authority ; but it is not at all necessary that the authority should embark also an investigation of the facts, deep or perfunctory, before according the sanction.
The decision lends no support to the view that wherever there is a sanction, the sanctioning authority is disabled under section 556 of the Code from trying the case initiated as a result of the sanction. the other hand, there is plenty of support for the opposite) view.
In the very early case of The Government of Bengal vs HeeraLall Dass and Others(1), at a time when there (1) (1872) 17 Weekly Reporter, Criminal Rulings, 39. 133 was no such statutory provision as section 556 of the Code but, only the general rule of law that a man could not be judge in a case in which he had an interest, the facts were that a Sub Registrar, who was also an Assistant Magistrate, having come to know in his official capacity as a registering officer that an offence under the Registration Act had been committed, sanctioned a prosecution, and subsequently tried the case himself.
A Full Bench consisting of Sir Richard Couch C. ' J. and five other learned Judges came to the conclusion, after an examination of some of the English cases, that the trial was not vitiated.
The learned Chief Justice said: ""In this case, I think, the Sub Registrar has not such an interest in the matter as disqualifies him from trying the case; and I may observe with reference to some of the arguments that have been used as to the Sub Registrar having made up his mind, and that the accused would have no chance of a fair trial, that the sanction of the superior officer, the Registrar, is required before the prosecution can be instituted, and certainly I do not consider that the prosecution will not be instituted unless the Sub Registrar has made up his mind as to the guilt of the party.
It is his duty, when he comes to know that an offence has been committed, to cause a prosecution to be instituted, by which I understand that there is prima facie evidence of an offence having been committed, that there is that which renders it proper that there should be ail enquiry, and the Registrar accordingly gives his sanction to it ; and certainly, I cannot suppose that, because an officer in his position sanctions the institution of a prosecution, his mind is made up as to the guilt of the party and .
that he is not willing to consider the evidence which may be produced before him when he comes to try the case.
In this case, there appears to 'be no such interest as would prevent the case from going"" before the Magistrate as the trying authority . 134 In Queen Empress vs Chenchi Reddi(1) it was pointed out that when there was only an authorisation and not a direction, there was no supervening disability ; and the case of Girish Chunder Ghose vs The QueenEmpress(2) was distinguished, the ground that there the Magistrate had taken a very active part in connection with the case as an executive officer.
The Bombay High Court went even a step further in the case reported in Emperor vs Bavji(3), where the Magistrate who tried the case had earlier held a departmental enquiry and forwarded the papers to the Collector with his opinion that there was sufficient evidence to justify a criminal prosecution.
As he did no more than express an opinion that there was evidence, which he, had neither taken nor sifted, which made a criminal prosecution desirable, it was held that the Magistrate was not disqualified from holding the trial, though, no doubt it would have been more expedient had the Collector sent the case for disposal to another of his subordinates.
As stated already, the question whether the bar under section 556 comes into play depends upon the facts and circumstances of each particular case, the dividing line being a thin one somewhat but still sufficiently definite and tangible, namely, the removal of a legal impediment by the grant 'of sanction and the initiation of criminal proceedings as the result of a direction.
In the present case before us, we have nothing more than a sanction, and consequently we are unable to hold that the trial has become vitiated by reason of the provisions of section 556, Criminal Procedure Code.
The other point taken behalf of the appellant is a more substantial one.
The security bond was taken from him not by the court but by the Procurement Inspector.
It is true that it contained the undertaking that, the seized paddy would be produced before the court, but still it was a promise made to the particular official and not to the court.
The High (1) Mad. 238.
(3) (19O3) (2) Cal.
857. 135 Court was in error in thinking that section 514, Criminal Procedure Code, applied.
Action could be taken only when the bond is taken by the court under the provisions of the Code such as section 91 for appearance, the several security sections or those relating to bail.
Clause (1) of section 514 runs: ""Whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of the, Court by which a bond under this Code has been taken, or of the Court of a Presidency Magistrate or Magistrate of the first class, or when the bond is for appearance before a Court, to the satisfaction of such Court, that such bond has been forfeited, the Court shall record the grounds of such proof, and may call upon any person bound by such bond to pay the penalty thereof, or to show cause why it should not be paid.
"" The language is perfectly clear; the power to forfeit and the imposition of the penalty provided for in the later parts of the section arise only if the preliminary conditions are satisfied.
There was no argument addressed to us that the High Court in suggesting that action should be taken under section 514 for forfeiture of the bond acted in the exercise of its inherent powers under section 561 A.
It did not purport to exercise any such power; and, moreover, there will then arise the question whether when the Code contains an express provision a particular subject, there could be any resort to inherent jurisdiction, under a general provision.
We have got an additional circumstance in the appellant 's favour in this case that the seized paddy was taken away by a member of the Legislative Assembly for giving relief to those affected by the earthquake, and if that is true, as it seems to be from the letter written by the ' M.L.A. to the Additional District Magistrate the 1st November, 1950, it appears to us harsh, if not unjust, to ask him to produce the same paddy or a similar quantity of paddy.
The order of the High Court sending back the case to the 136 Magistrate for taking action according to law under section 514 will, therefore, stand set aside.
We generally do not interfere in the matter of sentence, but in this case we find that the Magistrate has held that the appellant 's plea that he was ignorant of the provisions of the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947, was a genuine one.
Having regard to this circumstance and the fact that from a fine of Rs. 50 to 6 months ' rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1,000 is a big jump, we think it is appropriate that the sentence of imprisonment imposed by the High Court should be set aside and we order accordingly.
The fine of Rs. 1,000 will stand.
Sentence reduced.
","The question whether a Magistrate is ""personally interested"" in a ease within the meaning of section 556, Criminal Procedure Code, has essentially to be decided the facts of each case.
Where an officer as a District Magistrate exercising his powers under section 7(1) of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, sanctioned the prosecution of a person for violation of sections 3 and 7 of the Assam Food Grains Control Order, 1947, and the same officer as Additional District Magistrate tried and convicted the accused, and it was contended that as the officer had given sanction for prosecution he was ""personally interested"" in the case within the meaning of section 656, Criminal Procedure Code, and the trial and conviction were therefore illegal: Held, that bymerely giving sanction for prosecution he did not become personally interested"" in the case and the trial and conviction were not illegal.
In both cases of sanction and direction to prosecute, an application of the mind is necessary, but there is this essential difference that in the one case there is a legal impediment to the prosecution if there is no sanction and in the other case there is a positive order that the prosecution should be launched.
For a sanction, all that is necessary for one to be satisfied about is the existence of a prima facie case.
In the case of a direction, a further element that the accused deserves to be prosecuted is involved.
Whether sanction should be granted or not may conceivably depend considerations extraneous to the merits of the case.
But where a prosecution is directed, it means that the authority who gives the sanction is satisfied in his own mind that the case must be initiated.
Sanction is in the nature of a permission, while direction is in the nature of a command.

GAJENDRAGADKAR, J.
This group of 26 criminal appeals has been placed for hearing and disposal before a special Constitutional Bench, because the appeals constituting the group raise two common important questions of Constitutional law.
Nine of these appeals have been preferred against the decisions of the Punjab High Court, whereas seventeen have been preferred against the decisions of the Bombay High Court.
All the appellants are detenues who have been detained respectively by the Punjab and the Maharashtra State Governments under Rule 30(1)(b) of the Defence of India Rules (hereinafter called the Rules) made by the Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred on it by section 3 of the Defence of India Ordinance, 1962 (No. 4 of 1962) (hereinafter called the Ordinance).
They applied to the Punjab and the Bombay High Courts respectively under section 491 (1) (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and alleged that they had been improperly and illegally detained.
Their contention was that section 3(2)(15)(1) and section 40 of the Defence 806 of India Act, 1962 (No. 51 of 1962) (hereinafter called 'the Act ') and Rule 36(1)(b) under which they have been detained are constitutionally invalid, because they contravene their fundamental rights under Articles 14, 21 and 22(4), (5) & (7) of the Constitution, and so, they claimed that an order should be passed in their favour directing the respective State Governments to set them at liberty.
These petitions have been dismissed on the ground that the Presidential Order which has been issued under article 359 of the Constitution creates a bar which precludes them from moving the High Court under section 491 (1) (b) Cr.
That is how the decisions of the two High Courts under appeal raise two common questions of considerable importance.
The first question is : what is the true scope and effect of the Presidential Order which has been issued under article 359 (1) ? The answer to this question would depend upon a fair and reasonable construction of article 359(1) itself.
The second question is : does the bar created by the Presidential Order issued under article 359(1) operate in respect of applications made by detenues under section 491 (1) (b) of the Code? The answer to this question would depend upon the determination of the true character of the proceedings which the detenues have taken under section 491(1)(b), considered in the light of the effect of the Presidential Order issued under article 359(1).
Both the Punjab and the Bombay High Courts have held against the appellants.
Meanwhile, when similar petitions were made before the Allahabad High Court in Criminal Cases Nos. 1618, 1759 and 1872 of 1963 Sher Singh Negi vs District Magistrate, Kanpur & Anr., the said High Court took a contrary view and directed the release of the detenues who had moved it under section 491 (1) (b) of the Code.
It is because the questions raised are important and the answers given by the different High Courts have disclosed a sharp difference of opinion that a Special Bench has been constituted to deal with these appeals.
If the two principal questions are answered in favour of the detenues, a third question would arise and that relates to the validity of the impugned sections of the Act and the relevant statutory Rules.
On the 8th September, 1962, the Chinese aggressively attacked the northern border of India and that constituted a threat to the security of India.
That is why on 807 the 26th October, 1962, the President issued a Proclamation under article 352 of the Constitution.
This Proclamation declared, that a grave emergency existed whereby the security of India was threatened by external aggression.
On the same day, the Ordinance was promulgated by the President.
This Ordinance was amended by Ordinance No. 6 of 1962 promulgated on November 3, 1962.
On this day, the President issued the Order under article 359(1), suspending the rights of citizens to move any Court for the enforcement of the rights conferred by articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution for the period during which the proclamation of emergency issued on October 26, 1962 would be in force.
On November 6, 1962, the rules framed by the Central Government were published.
Then followed an amendment of the Presidential Order on November 11 1962.
By this amendment, for the words and figures ""article 21"" the words and figures ""articles 14 and 21"" were substituted.
On December, 6, 1962, Rule 30 as originally framed was amended and Rule 30 A added.
Last came the Act on December 12 1962.
Section 48(1) of the Act has provided for the repeal of the Ordinances Nos. 4 and 6 of 1962.
Section 48(2) provides that notwithstanding such repeal, any rules made, anything done or any action taken under the aforesaid two Ordinances shall be deemed to have been made, done or taken under this Act as if this Act had commenced on October 26, 1962.
That is how the Rules made under the Ordinance continued to be the Rules under the Act, and it is under Rule 30(1) (b) that the appellants have been detained.
Before dealing with the points which have been raised for our decision in the present appeals, it is necessary to indicate briefly at the outset the general argument which has been urged before us by Mr. Setalvad on behalf of the appellants, and the learned Attorney General on the other side.
article 359(1.) which falls to be construed, occurs in Part XVIII of the Constitution which makes emergency provisions.
Whenever the security of India or any part of the territory of India is threatened whether by war or by external aggression or internal disturbance, the President may, under article 352, by proclamation, make a declaration to ,hat effect.
Articles 353 to 360 which occur in this Part thus constitute emergency provisions.
The learned 808 Attorney General contends that in construing an emergency provision like article 359(1), we must bear in mind the fact that the said Article is intended to deal with a situation which has posed a threat to the security of India, and so, fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III which are un doubtedly of vital importance to the democratic way of life guaranteed by the Constitution have to be regulated during an emergency, because the very security of the nation is exposed to serious jeopardy.
The security of the nation on such a solemn occasion must have precedence over the liberty of the individual citizens, and so, it is urged that if article 359 is capable of two constructions, one in favour of the fundamental rights of the citizens, and the other in favour of the grant of power to the President to control those rights, the Court should lean in favour of the grant rather than in favour of the individual citizen 's fundamental rights.
In support of this argument, the learned Attorney General has relied on two decisions of the House of Lords.
In The King (At the Prosecution of Arthur Zadig) vs Halliday,(1) Lord Finlay L. C. who was called upon to construe Regulation 14B of the Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Regulations Act, 1914, noticed the argument that if the Legislature had intended to interfere with personal liberty, it would have provided, as on previous occasions of national danger, for suspension of the rights of the subject as to a writ of habeas corpus, and rejected it with the observations that the Legislature bad selected another war of achieving the same purposes, probably milder as well as more effectual than those adopted on the occasion of previous wars.
He added that the suggested rule as to construing penal statutes and the provision as to trial of British subjects by jury made by the Defence of the Realm Act, 1915, have no relevance in dealing with an executive measure by way of preventing a public danger.
The majority decision of the House of Lords in Liversidge vs Sir John Anderson (2 ) has also been relied upon by the learned Attorney General.
In that case, the House or Lords had to consider the true scope and effect of Regulation 18B of the Defence (General) Regulations, 1939.
(1) ; , 270.
(2) ; 809 Viscount Maugham in I rejecting the argument of the detenu that the liberty of the subject was involved and that the legislation dealing with the liberty of the subject must be construed, if possible, in favour of the subject and against the Crown, quoted with approval the language of Lord Finlay, L. C., in the case of Rex vs Halliday(1).
Lord Macmillan who took the same view observed that it is right so to interpret emergency legislation as to promote rather than to defeat its efficacy for the defence of the realm.
That is in accordance with a general rule applicable to the interpretation of all statutes or statutory regulations in peace time as well as in war time.
Lord Wright and Lord Romer adopted the same approach.
The Attorney General relies on the fact that this approach has also been adopted by Gwyer, C. J., in Keshav Talpade vs The King Emperor(2).
In making his contention in regard to the proper approach.
which the Court should adopt in construing article 359, the learned Attorney General no doubt contended that the question about the approach would arise only if two constructions are reasonably possible.
According to him, article 359 was capable of only one construction and that is the construction which the High Courts of Punjab and Bombay have accepted.
On the other hand, Mr. Setalvad has argued that article 359 is not an emergency legislation properly so called and on the merits, he has strongly resisted the suggestion made by the learned Attorney General that if two reasonable constructions are possible, we should adopt that which is in favour of the grant of power to the President and not in favour of the citizens fundamental rights.
He has relied on the minority speech of Lord Atkin in the case of Liversidge(3) and has argued that the view taken by Lord Atkin should be preferred to the majority view which the House of Lords adopted in that case.
""In this country"", observed Lord Atkin, ""amid the clash of arms, the laws are not silent.
They maybe changed, but they speak the same language in war as in peace.
It has always been one of the pillars of freedom, one of the principles of liberty for which on recent authority we are now fighting, that the judges are no respecters of persons and stand between (1) ; , 270.

In this case, I have listened to arguments which might have been addressed acceptably to the Court of King 's Bench in the time of Charles I."" Realising that he was in a minority, Lord Atkin added that he protested, even if he did it alone, against a strained construction put on words with the effect of giving ail uncontrolled power of imprisonment to the Minister.
In this connection, Mr. Setalvad referred to two subsequent decisions of the Privy Council in which the view taken by Lord Atkin has been accepted, vide Nakkuda Ali vs M. F. De section layaratne(1), and King Emperor vs Vimalabai Deshpande(2).
In the former case, Lord Radcliffe observed that indeed, it would be a very unfortunate thing if the decision of Liversidge 's case came to be regarded as laying down any general rule as to the construction of such phrases when they appear in statutory enactments, and he added that the said decision is an authority for the proposition that the words ""if A. B. has reasonable cause to believe"" are capable of meaning ""if A. B. honestly thinks that he has reasonable cause to believe"" and that in the context and attendant circumstances of Defence Regulation 18B they did in fact mean just that.
In distinguishing the said decision, Lord Radcliffe made the somewhat significant comment that the elaborate consideration which the majority of the House gave to the context and circumstances before adopting that construction itself shows that there is no general principle that such words are to be so understood.
Mr. Setalvad has also invited our attention to the fact that the majority decision of the House of Lords in Liversidge(3) has not received the approval from jurists, (vide Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes p. 276, footnote 54, Craies on Statue Law p. 309, and Friedmann, Law in a Changing Society p. 37.) Like the Attorney General, Mr. Setalvad also urged that the stage to choose between two rival constructions would not arise in the present appeals because, according to him, the construction for which he contended was the only reasonable construction of article 359.
(1) , 76.
(2) 73 I.A. 144.
(3) ; 811 In our opinion, it is unnecessary to decide the merits of the rival contentions urged before us in regard to the rule of construction and the approach which the Court should adopt in construing article 359.
It is common ground that the question of approach would become relevant and material only if we are satisfied that article 359 is reasonably capable of two alternative constructions.
As we will presently point out, after hearing counsel on both sides, we have reached the conclusion that article 359 is reasonably ,capable of only one construction and that is the construction which has been put on it by the Punjab and Bombay High Courts.
That is why we are relieved of the task of dealing with the merits of the controversy between the parties on this point.
Let us then revert to the question of construing article 359.
In doing so, it may be relevant and somewhat useful to compare and contrast the provisions of Articles 358 and 359.
Indeed, both Mr. Setalvad and the learned Attorney General contended that article 359 should be interpreted in the light of the background supplied by the comparative examination of the respective provisions contained in articles 358 and 359 (1) & (2).
The said two Articles read as under : ""358.
While a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, nothing in article 19 shall restrict the power of the State as defined in Part III to make any law or to take any executive action which the State would but for the provisions contained in that Part be competent to make or to take, but any law so made shall, to the extent of the competency, cease to have effect as soon as the Proclamation ceases to operate, except as respects things done or omitted to be done before the law so ceases to have effect 359 (1) Where a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, the President may by order declare that the right to move any Court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in the order and all proceedings pending in any court for the enforcement of the rights so mentioned shall remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation is in force or for such shorter period a may be specified in the order.
812 (2)Any order made as aforsesaid may extend to the whole or any part of the territory of India.
"" It would be noticed that as soon as a Proclamation of Emergency has been issued under article 352 and so long as it lasts, article 19 is suspended and the power of the legis latures as well as the executive is to that extent made wider.
The suspension of article 19 during the pendency of the Proclamation of emergency removes the fetters created on the legislative and executive powers by article 19 and if the legislatures make laws or the executive commits acts which are inconsistent with the rights guaranteed by article 19, their validity is not open to challenge either during the 'continuance of the emergency or even thereafter.
As soon as the Proclamation ceases to operate, the legislative enactments passed and the executive actions taken during the course of the said emergency shall be inoperative to the extent to which they conflict with the rights guaranteed under article 19 because as soon as the emergency is lifted, article 19 which was suspended during the emergency is automatically revived and begins to operate.
Article 358, however, makes it clear that things done or omitted to be done during the emergency cannot be challenged even after the emergency is over In other words, the suspension of article 19 is complete during the period in question and legislative and executive action which contravenes article 19 cannot be questioned even after the emergency is over.
Article 359, on the other hand, does not purport expressly to suspend any of the fundamental rights.
It authorises the President to issue an order declaring that the right to move any court for enforcement of such of the rights in Part III as may be mentioned in the order and all proceedings pending in any court for the enforcement of the rights so mentioned shall remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation is in force or for such shorter period as may be specified in the order.
What the Presidential Order purports to do by virtue of the power conferred on 'the President by article 359(1) is to bar the remedy of the citizens to move any court for the enforcement of the specified rights.
The rights are not expressly suspended, but the citizen is deprived of his right to move any court for their enforcement.
That is one important 813 distinction between the provisions of article 358 and article 359(1).
Before proceeding further, we may at this stage, in parenthesis, observe that there has been some argument before us on the question as to whether the fundamental rights specified in the Presidential Order issued under article 359 are even theoretically alive during the period specified in the said Order.
The learned Attorney General has contended that the suspension of the citizens ' right to move any court for the enforcement of the said rights, in law, amounts to the suspension of the said rights themselves for the said period.
We do not propose ,to decide this question in the present appeals.
We will assume in favour of the appellants that the said rights arc, in theory, alive and it is on that assumption that we 'will deal with the other points raised in the present appeals.
The other distinction lies in the fact that the suspension of article 19 for which article 358 provides continues so long as the Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, whereas the suspension of the right to move any court which the Presidential Order under article 359(1) brings about can last either for the period of the Proclamation or for a shorter period if so specified by the Order.
It would be noticed that the Presidential Order cannot widen the authority of the legislatures or the executive; it merely suspends the rights to move any court to obtain a relief on the ground that the rights conferred by Part III have been contravened if the said rights are specified in the Order.
The inevitable consequence of this position is that as soon as the Order ceases to be operative, the infringement of the rights made either by the legislative enactment or by executive action can perhaps be challenged by, a citizen in a court of law and the same may have to be tried on the merits on the basis that the rights alleged to have been infringed were in operation even during the pendency of the Presidential Order.
If at the expiration .of the Presidential Order, Parliament passes any legislation to protect executive action taken during the pendency, of the Presidential Order and afford indemnity to the executive in that behalf, the validity and the effect of such legislative action may have to be carefully scrutinised.
814 Since the object of article 359(1) is to suspend the rights of the citizens to move any court, the consequence of the Presidential Order may be that any proceeding which may be pending at the date of the Order remains suspended during the time that the Order is in operation and may be revived when the said Order ceases to be operative; and fresh proceedings cannot be taken by a citizen after the Order has been issued, because the Order takes away the right to move any court and during the operation of the Order, the said right cannot be exercised by instituting a fresh proceeding contrary to the Order.
If a fresh proceeding failing within the mischief of article 359(1) and the Presidential Order issued under it is instituted after the Order has been issued, it will have to be dismissed as being incompetent.
In other words, article 359(1) and the Presidential Order issued under it may constitute a sort of moratorium or a blanket ban against the institution or continuance of any legal action subject to two important conditions.
The first condition relates to the character of the legal action and requires that the said action must seek to obtain a relief on the ground that the claimant 's fundamental rights specified in the Presidential Order have been contravened, and the second condition relates to the period during which this ban is to operate.
The ban operates either for the period of the Proclamation or for such shorter period as may be specified in the Order.
There is yet another distinction between the provisions of article 358 and article 359(1).
The suspension of Art '.
19 for which, provision is made under article 358 applies to the whole of the country, and so, covers all legislatures and also States.
On the other hand, the Order issued under article 359(1) may extend to the whole of India or may be confined to any part of the territory of India.
These, broadly stated, are the points of distinction between article 358 and article 359(1), What then is the true scope and effect of, article 359(1).? Mr. Setalvad contends that the right to move any court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in the Order should be construed to mean the right to move the Supreme Court which has been guaranteed by article 32(1).
He suggests that as one reads the relevant clause in article 359(1), one seems 815 to hear the echo of the right which has been constitu tionally guaranteed by article 32(1).
His argument, therefore, is that the only right of which a citizen can be deprived under article 359(1) is the right to, move the Supreme Court, and so, his case is that even in regard to fundamental rights specified in the Presidential Order, a citizen is entitled to ask for reliefs from the High Court under article 226 because the right to move the High Court flowing from article 226 does not fall within the mischief of article 359(1).
This argument attempts to interpret the words ""the right to move for the enforcement of the specified rights"" in isolation and without; taking into account the other words which indicate that the right to move which is specified in the said Article is the right to move ""any courts$.
In plain language, the words ""any court"" cannot mean only the Supreme Court they would necessarily take in all courts of competent jurisdiction.
If the intention of the Constitution makers was to confine the operation of article 359(1) to the right to move only the Supreme Court, nothing could have been easier than to say so expressly instead of using the wider words ""the right to move any court. ') To meet this difficulty,Mr.
Setalvad attempted to invoke the assistance of article 32(3).
article 32(3) provides that without prejudice to the: powers conferred on the Supreme Court by clauses (1) and ' (2), Parliament may by law empower any other court, to exercise within the local limits of its jurisdiction all or any of the powers exercisable by the Supreme Court under clause (2).
The argument is that the Constitution contemplates that there may be some other courts in the country on which the powers exercisable by the Supreme Court under article 32(2) may be conferred, and so, the words ""any court"" may have been intended to take within their purview the Supreme Court and such other courts oil whom the Supreme Courts powers under article 32(2) may have been conferred.
This argument is fallacious.
The scheme of article 32 clearly indicates that the right to move this Court which itself is a guaranteed fundamental right,, cannot be claimed in respect of courts falling under article 32(3).
article 32(3) merely provides for the conferment of this Court 's 816 powers under article 32(2) on the courts specified in clause (3).
The right guaranteed by article 32(1) cannot be claimed in respect of the said other courts.
Therefore, oh a plain construction of the relevant clauses of article 32, it is impossible to accept the argument that courts under article 32(3) must be regarded as having the same status as the Supreme Court and as such the right to move them must also be held to constitute a fundamental right of the citizen in respect of such courts.
Besides, it would be irrational to suggest that whereas the Constitution did not confer on the citizens a guaranteed fundamental right to move the High Court under article 226, it thought of conferring such a guaranteed fundamental right in regard to courts on which the Supreme ' Court 's powers under article 32(2) would be conferred by article 32(3).
Therefore, the attempt to suggest that 'the use of the words ""any Court"" used in article 359(1) is justified because they take in the Supreme Court and some other courts, fails and the conclusion inevitably follows that the words ""any court"" must be given their plain grammatical meaning and must be construed to mean any court of competent jurisdiction.
In other words the words ""any court"" include the Supreme Court and the High Courts before which the specified rights can be enforced by the citizens.
In this connection, it was attempted to be argued that the power of the High Court to issue the writs or orders specified in article 226(1) is a discretionary power and as such, no citizen can claim to have a right to move the High Court in that behalf, and '.
so, it was suggested that the proceedings contemplated by article 226(1) are outside the purview of article 359(1).
In our opinion, this argument is not well founded.
It is true that in issuing writs or orders under article 226(1), the High Courts have discretion to decide whether a writ or, %,order should be issued as claimed by the petitioner; but the discretion conferred on the High Courts in that behalf has to be judicially exer cised, and having regard to the scheme of article 226(1), it cannot be said that a citizen.
has no right to move the High Court for invoking its jurisdiction under article 226(1); article 226(1) confers wide powers on the High Courts to issue the specified writs, or other appropriate orders or directions; having regard to the nature of the said powers, 817 and the object intended to be achieved by their conferment there can be little doubt that in dealing with applications made before them the High Courts have to exercise their discretion in a judicial manner and in accordance with principles which are well settled in that behalf.
The High Courts cannot capriciously or unreasonably refuse to en tertain the said applications and to deal with them on the merits on the sole ground that the exercise of their juris diction under article 226(1) is discretionary.
Therefore, it is idle to suggest that the proceedings taken by citizens under article 226(1) are outside the purview of article 359(1).
We must accordingly hold that the right to move any court under article 359(1) refers to the right to move any court of competent jurisdiction.
The next question to consider is, what is the nature of the proceedings which are barred by the Presidential Order issued under article 359(1) ? They are proceedings taken by citizens for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in the order.
If a citizen moves any court to obtain a relief on the ground that his fundamental rights speci","The appellants were detained under r. 30(l) of the Defence of India Rules made by the Central Government under section 3 of the Defence of India Ordinance, 1962.
They applied to the Punjab and Bombay High Courts under section 491(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and their case was that sections 3(2)(15)(i) and 40 of the Defence of India Act, 1962, and r. 30(1)(b) of the Defence of India Rules, which were continued under the Act, were unconstitutional and invalid inasmuch as they contravened their fundamental rights under articles 14, 21, 22(4), (5) and (7) of the Constitution and that, therefore, they should be set at liberty.
The High Courts held that the Presidential Order which had been issued on November 3, 1962, under article 359(1) of the Constitution, after a declaration of emergency under article 352, consequent on the Chinese invasion of India, barred their right to move the said petitions and dismissed them.
These appeals raised two common questions in this Court, (1) what was the true scope and effect of the Presidential Order issued under article 359(1), and (2) did the bar created by the Order operate in respect of the applications under section 491(1)(b) of the Code.
The Presidential Order was as follows: ""G.S.R. 1464 In exercise of the powers conferred by cl.
(1) of article 359 of the Constitution, the President hereby declares that the right of any person to move any court for the enforcement of the right conferred by article 21 and article 22 of the Constitution shall remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation of Emergency issued under clause (1) of article 352 thereof on the 26th October 1962 is in force, if such person has been deprived of any such rights under the Defence of India Ordinance, 1962 (4 of 1962) or any rule or order made thereunder.
"" By a later amendment of the Order article 14 was incorporated into it.
798 Held:(per Gajendragadkar, Sarkar, Wanchoo, Hidayatullah, Das Gupta and Shah, JJ.) that the proceedings taken by the appellants in the High Courts under section 491(1)(b) of the Code were hit by the Presidential Order and must be held to be incompetent.
Article 359 of the Constitution was not capable of two interpretations and it was, therefore not necessary to decide the controversy raised by the parties as to whether that Article should be interpreted in favour of the President 's power granted by it or the fundamental rights of the citizens.

The words 'any court ' in article 359(1), construed in their plain grammatical meaning, must mean any court of competent jurisdiction including ' the Supreme Court and the High Courts before which the rights specified in the Presidential Order can be enforced.
It was not correct to say that the use of the words was necessary so as to include such other courts as might be empowered in terms of article 32(3).
Nor was it correct to say that the words could not include a High Court as its power to issue a writ under article 226(1) was discretionary.
In judging whether a particular proceeding fell within the purview of the Presidential Order the determining factor was not its form nor the words in which the relief was couched but the substance of it.
If in granting the relief the court had to consider whether any of the fundamental rights mentioned in the Presidential Order, had been contravened, the proceeding was within the Order, whether it was under article 32(l) or 226(1) of the Constitution.
The right to move the court for writ of habeas corpus under section 491(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was now a statutory right and could no longer be claimed under the common law.

Since the promulgation of the Constitution the two methods by which a citizen could enforce his right of personal freedom were (i) by a writ under article 226(1) or article 32(l), or (ii) under section 491(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
Whichever method he adopted if the right he sought to enforce was a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution the matter must, come within article 359(1) of the Constitution.
That the court could exercise its power under section 491(1)(b) suo motu could make no 799 difference and articles 372, 225 or 375 could provide no valid ground of attack.
The suspension of the right to move any court, as under the Presidential Order, must necessarily suspend the Court 's jurisdiction accordingly.
The right to challenge a detention order under section 491(1)(b) of the Code had been enlarged by the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and when a detenu relied upon such rights in his petition under that section he was in substance seeking to enforce his fundamental rights.
The prohibition contained in article 359(1) and the Presidential Order must, therefore, apply.
The expression ""right to move any court"" in article 359(1) and the Presidential Order takes in all legal actions, filed or to be filed, in which the specified rights are sought to be enforced and covers all relevant categories of jurisdictions of competent courts under which the said actions would other wise have been normally entertained and tried.

Even though the impugned Act may be invalid by reason of contravention of articles 14, 21 and 22, as contended by the appellants, that invalidity could not be challenged during the period prescribed by the Presidential Order and it could not be said that the President could not because of such invalidity issue the order.
Where, however, the challenge to the validity of the detention order was based on any right other than those mentioned in the Presidential Order, the detenu 's right to move any court could not be suspended by the Presidential Order because the right was outside article 359(1).
Where again the detention was challenged on the ground that it contravened the mandatory provisions of the relevant act or that it was malafide and was proved to be so and in all cases falling under the other categories of section 491(1) of the Code excepting those under section 491(1)(b), the bar of the Presidential Order could have no application.
So also the plea that the operative provision of the law under which the order of detention was made suffered from the vice of excessive delegation, was an independent plea not relatable to the fundamental rights mentioned in the Presidential Order and its validity had to be examined.
The plea that section 3(2)(15)(i) and section 40 of the impugned Act suffered from excessive delegation must fail.
The legislative policy was broad stated in the preamble and the relevant provisions of sections 3(1) and 3(2) gave detailed and specific guidance to the rule making authority and it was not correct to say that the Act had by the impugned sections delegated essentially legislative function to that authority.
Rule 30(1)(b) which was consistent with the operative provisions of the Act could not also be challenged on that ground.

The impugned Act could not also he struck down as a piece of colourable legislation because the , was already on the Statute book.
The Parliament had power under Entry 9, List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and if in view of the grave threat to the security of India it passed the Act, it could not be said to have acted malafide.
If the Parliament thought that the executive would not be able to detain citizens reasonably suspected of prejudicial activities by a recourse to the , which provided for the required constitutional safeguards and the impugned Act which it enacted did not, it could not be suggested that it was acting malafide.
Even if the impugned Act contravened articles 14 and 22 and the detentions thereunder were invalid, article 359(1) and the Presidential Order, which were precisely meant to meet such a situation, barred investigation on the merits during the period prescribed by the Order.
The proceeding under section 491(1)(b) of the Code is one pro ceeding and the sole relief that can be claimed under it is release from the detention.
If that could not be claimed because of the Presidential Order it was unreasonable to say that a mere declaration that the impugned Act and the detention thereunder were invalid could be made.
Such a declaration is clearly outside the purview of section 491(1)(b) of the Code as also of articles 226(1) and 32(l) of the Constitution.
The period for which the emergency should continue and the restrictions that should be imposed during its continuance are matters that must inevitably be left to the executive.
In a democratic state the effective safeguard against any abuse of power in peace as also in emergency is the existence of enlightened, vigilant and vocal public opinion.
Liversidge vs Sir John Anderson, [19421 A.C. 206, referred to.
The inviolability of individual freedom and the majesty of law that sustains it are equally governed by the Constitution which has made this Court the custodian of the fundamental rights on the one hand and, on the other, provided for the declaration of the emergency.
Consequently, in dealing with the right of a citizen to challenge the validity of his detention, effect must be given to article 359(1) and the Presidential Order issued under it.
The right specified in that Article must be held to include such right whether constitutional or constitutionally guaranteed and the words ""any court"" must include the Supreme Court and the High Court.
The Punjab and the Bombay High Courts were, therefore right in their decision that the applications under section 491(1)(b) of 801 the Code were incompetent in so far as they sought to challenge the validity of the detentions on the ground that the Act and the Rules under which the orders were made contravened articles 14, 21 and 22(4)(5) and (7) of the Constitution.
Per Subba Rao, J. It was clear that section 3(2)(15)(i) of the Defence of India Act, 1962, and r. 30(1)(b) made under the Act contravened the relevant provisions of article 22 of the Constitution and were, therefore, void.

Under the Constitution, every person has a right to move the Supreme Court, the High Courts or any other court or courts constituted by the Parliament under article 32(3) for the enforcement of fundamental rights in the manner prescribed.
But while the right to move the Supreme Court is a guaranteed right, the right to move the others is not so.
Article 359, properly construed, meant that the bar imposed by the Presidential Order applied not only to the guaranteed right to move the Supreme Court but also the rights to move the other courts under article 32 and article 226 of the Constitution.
There is no new rule of construction peculiar to war measures.
It is always the same, whether in peace or in war.
The fundamental rule is that the courts have to find out the expressed intention of the Legislature from the words of the enactment itself.
Words must be given their natural and ordinary meaning unless there is ambiguity in the language in which case the court has to adopt that meaning which furthers the intention of the Legislature.
A constitutional provision such as article 359, however, cannot be given a strained construction to meet a passing phase such as the present emergency.

Section 491 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is wide in its terms and gives a discretionary power to the High Courts.
Unlike articles 32 and 226, the exercise of the power is not channelled through procedural writs or orders and their technicalities cannot circumscribe the court 's discretion.
Girindra Nath Banerjee vs Birendra Nath Pal, (1927) I.L.R. , District Magistrate, Trivandrum vs Mammen Mappillai, I.L.R. , Matten vs District Magistrate, Trivandrum, L.R. (1939) 66 I.A. 222, referred to.
Section 491 is continued by article 372 and article
225 preserves 802 the jurisdiction of the High Court.
The power it confers on the High Court is not inconsistent either with article 32 or article 226 or any other Article of the Constitution and the section cannot, therefore, be said to have been impliedly superseded even to the extent article 226 empowers the High Court to give relief in cases of illegal detention.
Though remedial in form the section postulates the existence of the substantive right that no person can be deprived of his liberty except in the manner prescribed by law.
It assumes the existence of the rule of law and empowers High Court to act suo motu.
The rights, substantive and procedural conferred by it arc different from those under articles 32 or 226 of the Constitution.
It places the onus on the custodian to prove that the detention is legal and although in scrutinising the legality of the detention the court may have to consider whether the law offends any fundamental rights, that cannot make the proceeding one for the enforcement of fundamental rights or the decision anything but one on the unconstitutionality of a law because of infringement of fundamental rights generally.
The mode of approach to the High Court under section 491 of the Code or the nature of the relief given thereunder cannot be equated with those under the Constitution.
The absolute discretionary jurisdiction under it cannot be put on a par with the jurisdiction under article 226 which is hedged in by constitutional limitations.
Alam Khan vs The Crown, Lahore 274, Ramji Lal vs The Crown, I.L.R. (1949) 11 E.P. 28, King Emperor vs Vimlabai Deshpande, (1946) L.R. 73 I.A. 144, referred to.
While section 491 gives no right to enforce fundamental rights, operating as it does as a check on arbitrary action, article 359 is concerned not with statutory powers but deals with the constitutional right and the constitutional enforcement of it.
It was not, therefore, correct to say that article 359 would be frustrated if section 491 was allowed to stand for Parliament might amend that section any time it liked.
The expression ""right to move any court for enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part 111"" in article 359 must refer only to the right to move under article 32 or article 226 for the said specific relief and could not be applied to the exercise of the statutory power of the High Courts under section 491 of the Code and, consequently, the expression ""all proceedings pending in any court for the enforcement of the rights"" must refer to the proceedings initiated in exercise of that right.
The detenus could not, therefore, enforce their fundamental rights under articles 21, 32 and 14 while the Presidential Order lasted, but that did not affect the High Court 's power under section 491 of the Code.
The President 's Order cannot bar the detenus from proving even under articles 32(l) and 226 that the detentions were not made 803 under the Defence of India Ordinance or the Act as they were outside the Ordinance or the Act or in excess of the power conferred by them or that the detentions were made malafide or in fraudulent exercise of power.

December 4.
The Court delivered Judgment as follows.
KANIA C.J. This is an application by the holder of one ordinary share of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd. for a writ of mandamus and certain other reliefs under article 32 of the Constitution of India.
The authorized capital of the company is Rs. 48 lakhs and the paid up capital is Rs. 32 lakhs, half of which is made up of fully paid ordinary shares of Rs. 1,000 each.
875 I have read the judgment prepared by Mr. Justice Mukher jea.
In respect of the arguments advanced to challenge the validity of the impugned Act under articles 31 and 19 of the Constitution of India, I agree with his line of reasoning and conclusion and have nothing more to add.
On the question whether the impugned Act infringes article 14, two points have to be considered.
The first is whether one individual shareholder can, under the circum stances of the case and particularly when one of the re spondents is the company which opposes the petition, chal lenge the validity of the Act on the ground that it is a piece of discriminatory legislation, creates inequality before the law and violates the principle of equal protec tion of the laws under article 14 of the Constitution of India.
The second is whether in fact the petitioner has shown that the Act runs contrary to article 14 of the Con stitution.
In this case having regard to my conclusion on the second point, I do not think it is necessary to pro nounce a definite opinion on the first point.
I agree with the line of reasoning and the conclusion of Mr. Justice Mukherjea as regards the second point relating to the inva lidity of the Act on the ground that it infringes article 14 of the Constitution and have nothing more to add.
In my opinion therefore this petition fails and is dismissed with costs.
FAZL ALI J.
I am strongly of the opinion that this peti tion should be dismissed with costs.
The facts urged in the petition and the points raised on behalf of the petitioner before us are fully set forth in the judgments of my brethren, Sastri, Mukherjea and Das JJ., and I do not wish to repeat them here.
It is sufficient to say that the main grounds on which the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1950 (Act No. XXVIII of 1950), which will hereinafter be referred to as ""the Act"", has been assailed, is that it infringes three fundamental rights, these being: 876 (1) the right to property secured by article 31 of the Constitution; (2) the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property, guaranteed to every citizen by article 19 (1) (f); and (3) the right to equal protection of the laws, guaran teed by article 14.
It has been held in a number of cases in the United States of America that no one except those whose rights are directly affected by a law can raise the question of the constitutionality of that law.
This principle has been very clearly stated by Hughes J. in McCabe vs Atchison(1), in these words : ""It is an elementary principle that in order to justify the granting of this extraordinary relief, the complainant 's need of it and the absence of an adequate remedy at law must clearly appear.
The complainant cannot succeed because someone else may be hurt.
Nor does it make any difference that other persons who may be injured are persons of the same race or occupation.
It is the fact, clearly established, of injury to the complainant not to others which justifies judicial interference.
"" On this statement of the law, with which I entirely agree, the scope of the discussion on this petition is greatly restricted at least in regard to the first two fundamental rights.
The company and the shareholders are in law separate entities, and if the allegation is made that any property belonging to the company has been taken possession of without compensa tion or the right enjoyed by the company under article 19 (1) (f) has been infringed, it would be for the company to come forward to assert or vindicate its own rights and not for any individual shareholder to do so.
In this view, the only question which has to be answered is whether the peti tioner has succeeded in showing that there has been an infringement of his rights as a shareholder under articles 31 and 19 (1) (f) of the Constitution.
This question has been so elaborately dealt with by Mukherjea J., that I do not wish to add anything to what he has said in his judg ment, and all that is necessary for me to say is that I adopt his conclusions, (1) 235 u.s. 151.
877 without committing myself to the acceptance of all his reasonings.
The only serious point, which in my opinion, arises in the case is whether article 14 of the Constitution is in any way infringed by the impugned Act.
This article corresponds to the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America, which declares that ""no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws"".
Professor Willis dealing with this clause sums up the law as prevail ing in the United States in regard to it in these words: ""Meaning and effect of the guaranty The guaranty of the equal protection of the laws means the protection of equal laws.
It forbids class legislation, but does not forbid classification which rests upon reasonable grounds of distinction.
It does not prohibit legislation, which is limited either in the objects to which it is directed or by the territory within which it is to operate. 'It merely requires that all persons subjected to such legislation shall be treated alike under like circumstances and condi tions both in the privileges conferred and in the liabili ties imposed. ' 'The inhibition of the amendment . was designed to prevent any person or class of persons from being singled out as a special subject for discriminating and hostile legislation '.
It does not take from the states the power to classify either in the adoption of police laws, or tax laws, or eminent domain laws, but permits to them the exercise of a wide scope of discretion, and nullifies what they do only when it is without any reasonable basis.
Mathematical nicety and perfect equality are not required.
Similarity, not identity of treatment, is enough.
If any state of facts can reasonably be conceived to sustain a classification, the existence of that state of facts must be assumed.
One who assails a classification must carry the burden of showing that it does not rest upon any reasonable basis.""( ') Having summed up the law in this way, the same learned author adds : ""Many different classifications (1) Constitutional Law by Prof. Willis, (1st Edition).
p.579. 878 of persons have been upheld as constitutional.
A law apply ing to one person or one class of persons is constitutional if there is sufficient basis or reason for it.
"" There can be no doubt that article 14 provides one of the most valuable and important guarantees in the Constitution which should not be allowed to be whittled down, and, while ac cepting the statement of Professor Willis as a correct exposition of the principles underlying this guarantee, 1 wish to lay particular emphasis on the principle enunciated by him that any classification which is arbitrary and which is made without any basis is no classification and a proper classification must always rest upon some difference and must bear a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect of which it is proposed.
The petitioner 's case is that the shareholders of the Sholapur company have been subjected to discrimination visa vis the shareholders of other companies, inasmuch as section 13 of the Act subjects them to the following disabilities which the shareholders of other companies governed by the Indian Companies Act are not subject to: : ""(a) It shall not be lawful for the shareholders of the company or any other person to nominate or appoint any person to be a director of the company.
(b) No resolution passed at any meeting of the share holders of the company shall be given effect to unless approved by the Central Government.
(c) No proceeding for the winding up of the company or for the appointment of a receiver in respect thereof shall lie in any court unless by or with the sanction of the Central Government.
"" Primafacie, the argument appears to be a plausible one, but it requires a careful examination, and, while examining it, two principles have to be borne in mind : (1) that a law may be constitutional even though it relates to a single individual, in those cases where on account of some special circumstances or reasons applicable to him and not applica ble to others, 879 that single individual may be treated as a class by himself; (2) that it is the accepted doctrine of the American courts, which I consider to be well founded on principle, that the presumption is always in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment, and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of the constitutional principles.
A clear enunciation of this latter doctrine is to be found in Middleton vs Texas Power and Light Company(1), in which the relevant passage runs as follows : ""It must be presumed that a legislature understands and correctly appreciates the need of its own people, that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based upon adequate grounds.
"" The onus is therefore on the petitioner to show that the legislation which is impugned is arbitrary and unreasonable and there are other companies in the country which should have been subjected to the same disabilities, because the reasons which led the Legislature to impose State control upon the Sholapur company are equally applicable to them.
So far as article 14 is concerned, the case of the share holders is dependent upon the case of the company and if it could be held that the company has been legitimately sub jected to such control as the Act provides without violation of the article, that would be a complete answer to the petitioner 's complaint.
Now, the petitioner has made no attempt to discharge the burden of proof to which I have referred, and we are merely asked to presume that there must necessarily be other compa nies also which would be open to the charge of mismanagement and negligence.
The question cannot in my opinion be treated so lightly.
On the other hand, how important the doctrine of burden of proof is and how much harm can be caused by ignor ing it or tinkering with it, will be fully illustrated, by referring to the proceedings in the Parliament in connec tion with the enactment of the (1) ,157.
880 Act, where the circumstances which necessitated it are clearly set out.
I am aware that legislative proceedings cannot be referred to for the purpose of construing an Act or any of its provisions, but I believe that they are relevant for the proper understanding of the circumstances under which it was passed and the reasons which necessitat ed it.
A reference to the Parliamentary proceedings shows that some time ago, a representation was made on behalf of a section of the shareholders of the Sholapur company to the Registrar of Joint Stock Companies in Bombay, against the conduct of the managing agents, and the Government of Bombay was moved to order a special inquiry into the affairs of the company.
For the purpose of this inquiry, two special inspectors were appointed by the Bombay Government and their report revealed ""certain astounding facts"" and showed that the mill had been grossly mismanaged by the Board of Direc tors and the managing agents.
It also revealed that the persons who were responsible for the mismanagement were guilty of certain acts and omissions which brought them under the purview of the law.
The Bombay Government accept ed the report of the inspectors and instructed the Advocate General of Bombay to take legal proceedings against certain persons connected with the management of the company.
Thereafter, the Government of India was approached by the Provincial Government and requiested to take special action in order to secure the early opening of the mill.
The Government of India found that they had no power to take over the management of a particular mill, unless its working could be ensured through the existing management acting under the direction of a Controller appointed under the Essential Supplies Act, but they also found that a peculiar situation had been created in this case by the managing agents themselves being unable or unwilling to conduct the affairs of the company in a satisfactory and efficient manner.
The Government of India, as a matter of precaution and lest it should be said that they were going to interfere unnecessarily in the affairs 881 of the company and were not allowing the existing provisions of the law to take their own course, consulted other inter ests and placed the matter before the Standing Committee of the Industrial Advisory Council where a large number of leading industrialists of the country were present, and ultimately it was realized that this was a case where the Government could rightly and properly intervene and there would be no occasion for any criticism coming from any quarter.
It appears from the discussion on the floor of the House that the total number of weaving and spinning mills which were closed down for one reason or other was about 35 in number.
Some of them are said to have closed for want of cotton, some due to overstocks, some for want o[ capital and some on account of mismanagement.
The Minister for Indus try, who sponsored the Bill, in explaining what distin guished the case of the Sholapur mill from the other mills against whom there might be charges of mismanagement, made it clear in the course of the debate that ""certain condi tions had to be fulfilled before the Government can and should intervene"", and he set out these conditions as fol lows : ""(1) The undertaking must relate to an industry which is of national importance.
Not each and every undertaking which may have to close down can be taken charge of tempo rarily by Government.
(2) The undertaking must be an economic unit.
If it appears that it is completely uneconomic and cannot be managed at all, there is no sense in Government taking charge of it.
If anything, it will mean the Government will have to waste money which belongs to the taxpayer on an uneconomic unit.
(3) There must be a technical report as regards the condition of the plants, machinery, etc.
which either as they stand, or after necessary repairs and reconditioning can be properly utilised.
(4) Lastly, and this is of considerable importance there must be a proper enquiry held before Government take any action.
The enquiry should show that 113 882 managing agents have so misbehaved that they are no longer fit and proper persons to remain in charge of such an impor tant undertaking.
""(1) It appears from the same proceedings that the Sholapur mill is one of the largest mills in Asia and employs 13,000 workers.
Per shift, it is capable of producing 25 to 30 thousand pounds of yarn, and also one lakh yards of cloth.
It was working two shifts when it was closed down on the 29th August, 1949.
The closure of the mill meant a loss of 25 lakhs yards of cloth and one and a half lakhs pounds of yarn per month.
Prior to 1947, the highest dividend paid by the company was Rs. 525 per share and the lowest Rs. 100, and, in 1948, when the management was taken over by the managing agents who have been removed by the impugned Act, the accounts showed a loss of Rs. 30 lakhs, while other textile companies had been able to show very substantial profits during the same period.
Another fact which is brought out in the proceedings is that the.
managing agents had acquired control over the majority of the shares of the company and a large number of shareholders who were dissatisfied with the management had been rendered powerless and they could not make their voice heard.
By reason of the preponderance of their strength, the managing agents made it impossible for a controller under the Essential Supplies Act to function and they also made it difficult for the company to run smoothly under the normal law.
It was against this background that the Act was passed, and it is evident that the facts which were placed before the Legislature with regard to the Sholaput mill were of an extraordinary character.
and fully justified the company being treated as a class by itself.
There were undoubtedly other mills which were open to the charge of mismanagement, but the criteria adopted by the Government which, in my opinion, cannot be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable, is not applicable (1) parliamentary Debates, Volume III, No. 14; 31st March 1950, pp.2394 5 883 to any of them.
As we have seen, one of the criteria was that a mere allegation of mismanagement should not be enough and no drastic step such as is envisaged in the Act should be taken without there being a complete enquiry.
In the case of the Sholapur mill, a complete enquiry had been made and the revelations which were made as a result of such enquiry were startling.
We are familiar with the expression ""police power"" which is in vogue in the United States of America.
This expression simply denotes that in special cases the State can step in where its intervention seems necessary and impose special burdens for general benefit.
As one of the judges has pointed out, ""the regulations may press with more or less weight upon one than upon another, but they are designed not to impose unequal or unnecessary restrictions upon anyone, but to promote, with as little individual inconvenience as possible, the general good.
""(1) It need not be emphasized that the principles underlying what is known as police power in the United States of America are not peculiar to that country, but are recognized in every modern civilized State.
Professor Willis dealing with the question of classification in exercise of police power makes the following observa tions: ""There is no rule for determining when classification for the police power is reasonable.
It is a matter for judicial determination, but in determining the question of reasonableness the Courts must find some economic, political or other social interest to be secured, and some relation of the classification to the objects sought to be accomplished.
In doing this the Courts may consider matters of common knowledge, matters o[ common report, tile history of the times, and to sustain it they will assume every state of facts which can be conceived of as existing at the time Of legislation.
The fact that only one person or one object or one business or one locality is affected is not proof of denial of the equal protection of the laws.
For such (1) Per Field J. in Barbier vs Connally. ; 884 proof it must be shown that there is no reasonable basis for the classification.
"" In this particular case, the Government initially took control of the Sholapur Company by means of an Ordinance (Ordinance No. II of 1950), of which the preamble runs as follows : ""Whereas on account of mismanagement and neglect a situation has arisen in the affairs of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company, Limited, which has prejudicially af fected the production of an essential commodity and has caused serious unemployment amongst a certain section of the community; And whereas an emergency has arisen which renders it necessary to make special provision for the proper manage ment and administration of the aforesaid Company; Now, therefore,. . . . "" In the course of the Parliamentary debate, reference was made to the fact that the country was facing an acute cloth shortage, and one of the reasons which apparently influenced the promulgation of the Ordinance and the passing of the Act was that the mismanagement of the company had gravely affected the production of an essential commodity.
The facts relating to the mismanagement of this mill were care fully collected and the mischief caused by the sudden clos ing of the mill to the shareholders as well as to the gener al public were fully taken into consideration.
Therefore, it seems to me that to say that one particular mill has been arbitrarily and unreasonably selected and subjected to discriminatory treatment, would be an entirely wrong propo sition.
Article 14 of the Constitution, as already stated, lays down an important fundamental right, which should be closely and vigilantly guarded, but, in construing it, we should not adopt a doctrinaire approach which might choke all benefi cial legislation.
The facts to which I have referred are to be found in a public document, and, though some of them may (1) Constitutional Law by Prof. Willis (1st Edition) p. 580.
885 require further investigation forming as they do part of a one sided version, yet they furnish good prima, facie grounds for the exercise of the utmost caution in deciding this case and for not departing from the ordinary rule as to the burden of proof.
In the last resort, this petition can be disposed of on the simple ground that the petitioner has not discharged the onus which lies upon him, and I am quite prepared to rest my judgment on this ground alone.
I think that the petitioner has failed to make out any case for granting the writs or directions asked for, and the petition should therefore be dismissed with costs.
PATANJALI SASTRI J. This is an application under article 32 of the Constitution seeking relief against alleged infringe ment of certain fundamental rights of the petitioner.
The petitioner is a shareholder of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company, Limited, Sholapur, in tim State of Bombay, (hereinafter referred to as ""the Company "").
The authorised share capital of the Company consisted of 1590 fully paid up ordinary shares of Rs. 1,000 each, 20 fully paid up ordinary shares of Rs. 500 each and :32,000 partly paid up redeemable cumulative preference shares of Rs. 100 each, of which Rs. 50 only was paid up.
Of these, the petitioner held one ordinary share in his own name and 80 preference shares which, however, having been pledged with the Bank of Baroda Ltd., now stand registered in the Bank 's name.
The company was doing flourishing business till disputes arose recently between the management and the employees, and in or about August, 1949, the mills were temporarily closed and the company, which was one of the largest producers of cotton textiles, ceased production.
Thereupon, the Gover nor General intervened by promulgating on the 9th January, 1950, an Ordinance called the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company (Emergency Provisions) Ordinance (No. II ' of 1950), which empowered tim Government of India to 886 take over the control and management of the company and its properties and effects by appointing their own Directors and to delegate all or any of their powers to the Provincial Government.
In exercise of the powers thus delegated, the Government of Bombay appointed respondents 3 to 9 as Direc tors to take charge of the management and administration of the properties and affairs of the company.
Subsequently, on 10th April, '1950, the Ordinance was repealed and was re placed by an Act of Parliament containing similar provisons, namely the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company (Emergency Provisions) Act (No. XXVIII of 1950) (hereinafter referred to as the ""impugned Act"").
The petitioner complains that the impugned Act and the action of the Government of Bombay pursuant thereto have infringed the fundamental rights conferred on him by arti cles 11, 19 and 31 of the Constitution with the result that the enactment is unconstitutional and void, and the inter ference by the Government in the affairs of the company is unauthorised and illegal.
He accordingly seeks relief by way of injunction and mandamus against the Union of India and the State of Bombay impfended as respondents 1 and 2 respec tively in these proceedings and against respondents a to 9 who are now in management as already stated.
The company is irapleaded proforma as the 10th respondent.
Before discussing the issues involved, it is necessary to examine the relevant provisions of the impugned Act in order to see in what manner and to what extent the petition er 's rights have been affected thereby.
The preamble to the repealed Ordinance stated that ""on account of mis management and neglect a situation has arisen in the affairs of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company, Limited, which has prejudicially affected the production of an essen tial commodity and has caused serious unemployment amongst a certain section of the community and that an emergency has arisen which renders it necessary to make special provi sion for the proper management and administration of the aforesaid 887 Company."" This preamble was not reproduced in the impugned Act.
Section a empowers the Central Government to appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be directors of the company ""for the purpose of taking over its management and administration.
"" Section 4 states the effect of the order appointing directors to be that (1) the old directors shall be deemed to have vacated their office, (2) the contract with the managing agents shall be deemed to have been termi nated, (3) that the properties and effects of the company shall be deemed to be in the custody of the new directors who are to be ""for all purposes"" the directors of the compa ny and ""shall alone be entitled to exercise all the powers of the directors of the company whether such powers are derived from the Companies Act or from the memorandum or articles of association or otherwise.
"" Section 5 defines the powers of the new directors.
They are to manage the busi ness of the company ""subject to the control of the Central Government"" and shall have the power to raise funds offering such security as they think fit, to carry out necessary repairs to the machinery or other property in their custody and to employ the necessary persons and define the necessary conditions of their service.
Section 12 provides for the restoration of the management to directors nominated by the shareholders when the purpose of the Government 's interven tion has been fulfilled.
Section 13 is important and reads thus: ""13.
Application of the Companies Act. (1) Notwith standing anything contained in the Companies Act or in the memorandum or articles of association of the company (a) it shall not be lawful for the shareholders of the company or any other person to nominate or appoint any person to be a director of the company; (b) no resolution passed at any meeting of the shareholders of the company shall 'be given effect to unless approved by the Central Government; (c) no proceeding for the winding up of the company or for the appointment of a receiver in respect, thereof shall lie in any Court unless by or with the sanction of the Central Government.
(2) Subject.
888 to the provisions contained in sub section (1) and to the other provisions of this Act.
and subject to such excep tions, restrictions and limitations as the Central Govern ment may, by notified order, specify, the Companies Act shall continue to apply to the company in the same manner as it applied thereto before the issue of the notified order under section 3.
"" By section 14 the provisions of the Act are to have effect ""notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act.
"" Section 16 provides for delegation of powers to the Govern ment of Bombay to be exercised subject to the directions of the Central Government, and section 17 bars suits or other proceedings against the Central Government or the Government of Bombay or any director ""for any damage caused or likely to be caused by anything which is in good faith done or intended to be done in pursuance of this Act.
"" As a result of these provisions all the properties and effects of the company passed into the absolute power and control of the Central Government or its delegate the Gov ernment of Bombay, and the normal functioning of the company as a corporate body came to an end.
The shareholders have been reduced to the position of interested, if helpless, onlookers while the business is carried on against their will and, may be, to their disadvantage by the Government 's nominees.
The declared purpose of this arrangement was, according to the Preamble of the repeated Ordinance to keep up the production of an essential commodity and to avert serious unemployment amongst a certain section of the commu nity.
The question accordingly arises whether the impugned Act.
which thus affects the petitioner and his co sharehold ers, while leaving untouched the shareholders of all other companies, including those engaged in the production of essential commodities, denies to the petitioner the equal protection of the laws under article 14 of the Constitution.
The correct approach to 889 this question is first to see what rights have been con ferred or protection extended to persons similarly situated.
The relevant protection is to be found in the provisions of the Indian Companies Act which regulates the rights and obligations of the shareholders of incorporated companies in India.
Section 21 of the Act assures to the shareholders the protection of the stipulations contained in the memoran dum and articles of association by constituting.
them a binding contract, so that neither the company nor the share holders have the power of doing anything inconsistent there with.
The basic right of the shareholders to have their undertaking managed and conducted by the directors of their own choice is ensured by section 83B. Their right to exer cise control and supervision over the management by the directors by passing resolutions at their general meeting is regulated by various provisions of the Act.
The important safeguard of winding up the company in certain unfavourable circumstances either through court or by the shareholders thems elves voluntarily is provided for in sections 162 and 203.
All these rights and safeguards, on the faith of which the shareholders embark their money in their undertaking, are abrogated by the impugned Act in the case of the share holders of this company alone.
In fact, the Central Govern ment is empowered to exclude, restrict or limit the opera tion of any of the provisions of the Companies Act in rela tion to this company.
It is thus plain that the impugned Act denies to the shareholders of this particular company the protection of the law relating to incorporated joint stock companies in this country is embodied in the Companies Act and is primafacie within the inhibition of article 14.
It is argued, however, that article 14 does not make it incumbent on the Legislature always to make laws applicable to all persons generally, and that it is open to the Legis lature 'to classify persons and things and subject them to the operation of a particular law according to the aims and objects which that law is designed to secure.
In the present case, Parliament, 114 890 it was said, came to the conclusion, on the materials placed before them, that the affairs of the company were being grossly mismanaged so as to result in the cessation of production of an essential commodity and serious unemploy ment amongst a section of the community.
In view if the detriment thus caused to public economy, it was competent for Parliament to enact a measure applicable to this company and its shareholders alone, and Parliament must be the judge as to whether the evil which the impugned Act was designed to remedy prevailed to such an extent in this company as to call for special legislation.
Reliance was placed in support of this argument on certain American decisions dealing with the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.
It is, however, unnecessary to discuss those decisions here, for it is undeniable that equal protection of the laws cannot mean that all laws must be quite general in their character and application. ' A legislature empowered to make laws on a wide range of sub jects must of necessity have the pow","The Governor General of India, finding that on account of mismanagement and neglect a situation had arisen in the affairs of the Sholapur Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd. which had prejudicially affected the production of an essen tial commodity and had caused serious unemployment amongst a certain section of the community, and that an emergency had thereby arisen which rendered it necessary to make special provision for the proper management and administration of the said company, promulgated an Ordinance, which was subse quently reenacted in the form of an Act of the Legislature called the sholpur Spinning and Weaving Company (Emergency Provisions)Act, 1950, the net result of which was that the Managing Agents of the said company were dismissed, the directors holding office at the time automatically vacated their office, the Government was authorised to appoint new directors, the rights of the shareholders of the company were curtailed in the matters of voting, appointment of directors, passing of resolutions and applying for winding up, and power was also given to the Government to further modify the Indian Companies Act in its application to the company; and in accordance with the provisions of the Ordi nance new directors were appointed by the Government.
A shareholder of the company made an application under article 32 of the Constitution for a declaration that the Act was void and for enforcement of his fundamental rights by a writ of mandamus against the Central Government, the Government of Bombay and the directors, restraining them from exercising any powers under the Act and from interfering with the management of the company, on the ground that the Act was not within the Legislative competence 870 of the Parliament and infringed his fundamental rights guaranteed by articles 19 (1) (f), 31 and 14 of the Constitu tion and was consequently void under article 13.

(i) that the impugned Act did not infringe any fundamental right of the petitioner under article 31 (1), as if did not deprive the company or the petitioner of any property save under authority of law; (ii) that the impugned Act did not infringe any fundamen tal right guaranteed by article 31 (2.) inasmuch as it did not authorise the ""acquisition"" of any property of the company or of the shareholders or ""the taking possession"" of the property of the petitioner, namely, the shares which he held in the company, though he was disabled from exercising some of the rights which an ordinary shareholder in a company could exercise in respect of his shares, such as the right to vote, to appoint directors, and to apply for winding up; and, if the Act had authorised the ""taking possession"" of the property of the company, the petitioner was not entitled to any relief on that score under article 32; (iii) that, as the Act did not impose any restrictions on the petitioner 's right ""to acquire, hold and dispose of"" his shares, there was no infringement of article 19 (1) (f); and assuming that the restrictions imposed on the right of voting etc.

dissenting). that though the Legislature had proceeded against one company only and its shareholders, inasmuch as even one corporation or a group of persons can be taken to be class by itself for the purposes of legislation, provided there is sufficient basis or reason for it and there is a strong presumption in favour of the constitutionality/of an enactment, the burden was on the petitioner to prove that there were also other companies similarly situated and this company alone had been discrimi nated against, and as he had failed to discharge this burden the impugned Act cannot be held to have denied to the peti tioner the right to equal protection of the laws referred to in article He and the petitioner was not therefore entitled to any relief under article 32.
Per PATANJALI SASTRI J.
As the impugned Act plainly denied to the shareholders of this particular company the protections of the law relating to incorporated Joint Stock Companies as embodied in the Indian Companies Act.
it was Prima facie within 871 the inhibition of article 14; and, even though when a law is made applicable to a class of persons or things and the classification is based on differentia having a rational relation to the object sought to be attained, it can be no objection to its constitutional validity that its applica tion is found to affect only one person or thing.
since the impugned Act selected a particular company and imposed upon it and its shareholders burdens and disabilities on the ground of mismanagement and neglect of duty on the part of those charged with the conduct of its undertaking no ques tion of reasonable classification arose and the Act was plainly discriminatory in character and within the constitu tional inhibition of article 14.
Whilst all reasonable pre sumptions must undoubtedly be made in favour of the consti tutional validity of a law made competent legislature, no such presumption could be raised in this case as on the face of it the Act was discriminatory and the petitioner could not be called upon to prove that similar mismanagement existed in other companies.
The issue was not whether the impugned Act was ill advised or not justified by the facts on which it was based but whether it transgressed the ex plicit constitutional restriction on legislative power imposed by article 14.
Per DAs J. The impugned Act, ex facie, is nothing but an arbitrary selection of a particular company and its shareholders for discriminating and hostile treatment, and, read by itself, is palpably an infringement of article 14 of the Constitution.
Assuming that mismanagement and neglect in conducting the affairs of a company can be a basis of classification and that such a classification would bear a reasonable relation to the conduct of all delinquent compa nies and shareholders and may therefore create no inequali ty, a distinction cannot be made between the delinquent companies inter se or between shareholders of equally delin quent companies, and one set cannot he punished for its delinquency while another set is permitted to.
continue, or become, in like manner, delinquent without any punishment unless there be some other apparent difference in their respective obligations and unless there be some cogent reason why prevention of mismanagement is more imperative in one instance than in the other.
The argument that the pre sumption being in favour of the Legislature, the onus is on the petitioner to show that there are other individuals or companies equally guilty of mismanagement prejudicially affecting the production of an essential commodity and causing serious unemployment amongst, certain section of the community does not, in such circumstances, arise, for the simple reason that here there has been no classification at all and, in any case, the basis of classification by its very nature is much wider and cannot, in its application, be limited only to this company and its shareholders; and that being so, there is no reason to throw on the petitioner the almost impossible burden of proving that there are other companies which are in fact precisely and in all particulars similarly situated.
In any event the petitioner, 872 may well claim to have discharged the onus of showing that this company and its shareholders have been singled out for discriminating treatment by showing that the Act, on the face of it, has adopted a basis of classification which, by its very nature, cannot be exclusively applicable to this company and its shareholders but which may be equally ap plicable to other companies and their shareholders and has penalised this particular company and its shareholders, leaving out other companies and their shareholders who may be equally guilty of the alleged vice of mismanagement and neglect of the type referred to in the preamble in the Ordinance.

In so far as the petitioner 's rights as a shareholder were curtailed he was entitled to apply for relief under article 30, in his own right on the ground that the Act denied to him the equal protection of the laws and therefore contravened article 14 even though the other share holders did not join him in the application.
Per MUKHERJEA J.
The fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution are available not merely to individual citizens but to corporate bodies as well except where the language of the provision or the nature of the right, com pels the inference that they are applicable only to natural persons.
An incorporated company, therefore, can come up to the Supreme Court for enforcement of its fundamental rights and so may the individual shareholders to enforce their own; but as the company and its shareholders are in law separate entities, it would not be open to an individual shareholder to complain of a law which affects the fundamental right of the company except to the extent that it constitutes an infraction of his own rights as well.
In order to redress a wrong to the company the action should prima facie be brought by the company itself.
Article 32 of the Constitution is not directly concerned with the determination of the constitutional validity of particular enactments, what it aims at is the enforcement of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution and to make out a case under the Article it is incumbent on the petitioner to establish not merely that the law complained of is beyond the competence of the Legislature but that it affects or invades his fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, of which he could seek enforcement by an appropriate writ or order.
Under article 32 the Supreme Court has a very wide discre tion in the matter of framing writs to suit the exigencies of particular cases and an application under the article cannot be thrown out simply on the ground that the proper writ or direction has not been prayed for.
In the context in which the word ""acquisition"" is used in article 31 i2) it means and implies the acquiring of the entire title of the expropriated owner whatever the nature or extent of that right might be, 873 The guarantee against the denial of equal protection of the laws does not mean that identically the same rules of law should be made applicable to all persons within the territory of India in spite of differences of circumstances and conditions.
It means only that there should be no discrimination between one person and another if as regards the subject matter of the legislation their position is the same.
Quaere : Whether the word ""property"" in article 31 means the totality of the rights which the ownership of the property connotes, and whether clause (1) of article 31 contem plates only confiscation or destruction of property in exercise of what are known as police powers in American law for which no compensation is necessary.
DAS J.
The question whether an Act has deprived a person of his ""property"" must depend on whether it has taken away the substantial bulk of the rights constituting his property.
Where the most important rights possessed by the shareholders of a company are still preserved by an Act even though certain privileges incidental to the ownership of the shares have been put in abeyance, the shareholders cannot be said to have been deprived of their ""property"" in the sense in which that word is used in article 19(1) (f) and article 31.
If on the face of the law there is no classification at all, or at any rate none on the basis of any apparent dif ference specially peculiar to the individual or class af fected by the law, it is only an instance of an arbitrary selection of an individual or class for discriminating and hostile legislation and, therefore, no presumption can, in such circumstances, arise at all Assuming, however, that even in such a case the onus is thrown on the complainant, there can be nothing to prevent him from proving, if he can, from the text of the law itself, that it is actually and palpably unreasonable and arbitrary and thereby discharging the initial onus.
The right to vote, to elect directors, to pass resolu tions and to present an application for winding up, are privileges incidental to the ownership of a share, but they are not by themselves apart from the share, ""property"" within the meaning of article 19 (1) (f) and article 31; and even assuming that they are ""property"" such rights cannot be said to have been acquired or taken possession of by the Govern ment in this case within article 31 (2).
The language of clause (1) of article 31 is wider than that of clause (2), for deprivation of property may well be brought about otherwise than by acquiring or taking possession of it and in such a case no question payment of compensation arises.
FAZAL ALI MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ.
Except in the matter writs in the nature of habsas corpus no one but those whose rights are directly affected by a law can raise the question of the constitutionality of a law and claim relief under article 39.
A corporation being a different entity from the shareholders, a 112 874 share holder cannot complain on the ground that the rights of the company under articles 19 (1) (f) or 31 are infringed.
FAZL ALl J.
A classification which is arbitrary and which is made without any basis is no classification and a proper classification must always rest upon some difference and must hear a reasonable and lust relation to the things in respect of which it is proposed.
But the presumption is always in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear transgression of constitutional principles.
Though article 14 lays down an important fundamental 'right, which should be closely and vigilantly guarded, a doctri naire approach which might choke all beneficial legislation should not be adopted, in construing it.

Appeal from the judgment of the Allahabad High Court (Verma and Yorke JJ.) dated the 22nd April, 1943.
100 782 M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (Sri Narain And ley, with him), for the appellant.
P.L. Banerjee (H. J. Urnrigal, with him), for the respondents.
November 14.
MLKHERJEA J. This is an appeal against a judjment and decree of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court dated April 22, 1943, which reversed on appeal those of the Civil Judge of Basti dated 6th of November 1939.
The suit, out of which the appeal arises, was commenced by the plaintiff, whose successor the present appellant is, to recover a sum of Rs. 11,935 by enforcement of a simple mortgage bond.
The mortgage deed is dated the 8th of March 1926 and was executed by Raja Pateshwari Partap Narain Singh, the then holder of Basti Raj which is an impartible estate governed by the rule of primogeniture, in favour of Bhikhiram Sahu, the father of the original plaintiff Ramdeo, to secure a loan of Rs. 5,500 advanced by the mortgagee on hypothecation of certain immovable properties appertaining to the estate of the mortgagor.
The loan carried interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum and there was a stipula tion to pay the mortgage money within one year from the date of the bond.
The mortgagor and the mortgagee were both dead at the time when the suit was instituted, and the plaintiff in the action was Ramdeo Sahu, the son and heir of the mortgagee, while the principal defendant was the eldest son of the mortgagor who succeeded to the Basti estate under the rule of primogeniture.
It was stated in the plaint that absolutely nothing was paid by the mortgagor or his succes sor towards the mortgage dues and the plaintiff claimed the principal amount of Rs. 5,500 together with interest at the rate of 9 per cent.
per annum up to the date of the suit.
A number of pleas were taken by the contesting defend ant in answer to the plaintiff 's claim, most of which are not relevant for our present purpose.
The 783 substantial contentions raised by the defendant were of a three fold character.
In the first place, it was urged that the document sued upon was not a properly attested or valid ly registered document and could not operate as a mortgage instrument in law.
The second contention raised was that there was no consideration in support of the transaction, at least to the extent of Rs. 2,000, which was represented by items 3 and 4 of the consideration clause in the document.
The third and the last material defence related to a claim for relief under the United Provinces Agriculturists ' Relief Act.
The trial Judge held in favour of the defendant on the last point mentioned above and negatived his other pleas.
The result was that he made a preliminary decree for sale in favour of the plaintiff for recovery of the principal sum of Rs. 5,500 with interest at certain rates as are sanctioned by the U.P. Agriculturists ' Relief Act; and agreeably to the provisions of that Act the decretal dues were directed to be paid in a number of instalments.
Against this decision, the defendant took an appeal to the High Court of Allahabad which was heard by a Division Bench consisting of Verma and York JJ.
The learned Judges reversed the judgment of the trial Judge and dismissed the plaintiff 's suit on one ground only, viz., that the bond was not attested in the manner required by law and consequently could not rank as a mortgage bond; and as the suit was instituted beyond 6 years from the date of the bond, no money decree could be claimed by the plaintiff.
It is against this judgment that the plaintiff has come up on appeal to this court, and the main contention raised by the learned Attorney General, who appeared in support of the appeal, is that in arriving at its decision on the question of attestation, the High Court approached the matter from a wrong standpoint altogether and on the materi als in the record it had no justification for reversing the findings of the trial court on that point.
The question for our consideration is undoubtedly one of fact, the decision of which depends upon the 784 appreciation of the oral evidence adduced in the case.
In such cases, the appellate court has got to bear in mind that it has not the advantage which the trial Judge had in having the witnesses before him and of observing the manner in which they deposed in court.
This certainly does not mean that when an appeal lies on facts, the appellate court is not competent to reverse a finding of fact arrived at by the trial Judge.
The rule is and it is nothing more than a rule of practice that when there is conflict of oral evidence of the parties on any matter in issue and the decision hinges upon the credibility of the witnesses, then unless there is some special feature about the evidence of a par ticular witness which has escaped the trial Judge 's notice or there is a sufficient balance of improbability to dis place his opinion as to where the credibility lies, the appellate court should not interfere with the finding of the trial Judge on a question of fact(1).
The gist of the numer ous decisions on this subject was clearly summed up by Viscount Simon in Watt vs Thomas(2), and his observations were adopted and reproduced in extenso by the Judicial Committee in a very recent appeal from the Madras High Court(3).
The observations are as follows: ""But if the evidence as a whole can reasonably be re garded as justifying the conclusion arrived at at the trial, and especially if that conclusion has been arrived at on confliciting testimony by a tribunal which saw and heard the witnesses, the appellate court will bear in mind that it has not enjoyed this opportunity and that the view of the trial Judge as to where credibility lies is entitled to great weight.
This is not to say that the Judge of first instance can be treated as infallible in determining which side is telling the truth or is refraining from exaggeration.
Like other tribunals, he may go wrong on a question of fact, but it is a cogent circumstance that a Judge of first instance, when (1) Vide Lord Atkin 's observations in W.C. Macdonald vs Fred Latinmer, AI.R. 1929 P.C. 15, 18.
(2) at p. 486.
(3) Vide Saraveeraswami vs Talluri, A.I.R. 785 estimating the value of verbal testimony, has the advantage (which is denied to Courts of appeal)of having the witnesses before him and observing the manner in which their evidence is given.
"" It is in the light of these observations that we propose to examine the propriety of the decision of the s learned Judges of the High Court in the present case.
It will appear that the mortgage deed besides containing the signature of the executant, purports to bear the signatures of three other persons, two of whom are described as attesting wit nesses and the third one as the scribe.
Harbhajan Lal and Jawala Prasad Tewari purport to have signed the document as attesting witnesses and Jawala Prasad Patwari is the person who has signed it as the scribe.
Jawala Prasad Tewari was admittedly dead when the suit was brought and Harbhajan Lal, the only surviving attesting witness was called on behalf of the plaintiff to prove the execution of the deed as is required under section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act.
Harbhajan Lal stated in the witness box that he did sign the document as a witness and so did Jawala Prasad Tewari, but neither of them signed it in the presence of the mortgagor; nor did the mortgagor sign in their presence.
On this statement being made, the witness was declared hostile and he was allowed to be cross examined by the plaintiff 's Counsel.
He was cross examined by the defendant also and in answer to the questions put to him by the defendant 's lawyer, he stated that he signed the deed at the Collector ate Kutchery, meaning thereby the Bar Library, where he used to sit as a petition writer and the document was taken to him at that place by Bhikhi Ram Sahu, the mortgagee, Ghur Lal, a Karinda of the mortgagor, and Jawala Prasad Patwari, the scribe.
Jawala Prasad Tewari signed the deed after him.
The mortgagor certainly did not come to that place and his signature was already on the deed when the witness signed it.
The details of the defendant 's version relating to execution of this document were given by Jawala Prasad Patwari, who was the principal witness on the 786 side of the defendatnt.
He says that he prepared the draft at the sherista or the office of the Raja Sahib which is outside his Kot or palace.
The draft was prepared under instructions from Bhikhi Ram, the mortgagee.
and Ghur Lal, the Karinda of the mortgagor, both of whom were present when the draft was prepared.
After the draft was fair copied and stamped, the witness signed it as the scribe and then it was taken by Bhikhi Ram and Ghur Lal to the Kot or palace of the Raja for his signature.
After obtaining the Raja 's signa ture, Bhikhi Ram went away to his house and some time later he as well as Bhikhi Ram and Ghur Lal went to the Collector ate Kutchery, where they took the signatures of Harbhajan Lal and Jawala Prasad Tewari.
They then went to the registration office, where the document was presented for registration by Jainarayan Sukul who held a general power of attorney for the Raja.
As against this, there is a completely different version given by the plaintiff himself and his witness Buddhu Lal.
According to the plaintiff, the document was executed and attested at one and the same sitting in the Kot or palace of the Raja; the terms had been settled beforehand between Bhikhi Ram and the mortgagor and on the 8th of November 1926 the plaintiff himself, and not his father, went to the Raja 's palace at about 10 or 11 A.M. in the morning to get the document executed.
He was accompanied by three persons to wit Harbhajan Lal, the deed writer of his father, Buddhu Lal, an old servant of the family, and Jawala Prasad Tewari who was also well known to the plaintiff and was taken to bear witness to the deed.
They found Jawala Prasad Patwari already with the Raja when they reached the Kot.
The draft was prepared by Buddhu Lal at the suggestion of the Raja.
It was the plaintiff 's desire that the final document should be scribed by Harbhajan Lal but as the Raja wanted to oblige Jawala Prasad Patwari, who was the Patwari of Basti proper, the deed was faired out and scribed by Jawala Prasad patwari.
After the Raja had put his signature on the 787 document in the presence of Harbhajan Lal and Tewari, both the latter signed the document in the presence of the Raja.
The subsequent events narrated by the plaintiff relate to the registration of the document and we do not consider them to be material for our present purpose.
This story of the plaintiff is supported materially and on all points by Buddhu Lal, who was an old servant of the family, though he was no longer in service when he deposed in court.
There were thus two conflicting versions placed before the court and each side attempted to substantiate its case by verbal testimony of witnesses.
The trial Judge was to decide which of the two versions was correct and he ac cepted the story of the plaintiff and rejected that of the defendant.
The learned Judges of the High Court in dealing with the appeal do observe, at the beginning of their discussions, that on a question of fact the appellate court should be slow to differ from the conclusions arrived at by the trial Judge who had seen and heard the witnesses; but in their opinion, this rule did not apply to the present case as the trial Judge here did not base his conclusions on the impres sions created in his mind by the witnesses who deposed before him.
What the trial Judge relied upon, it is said, was not the demeanour of the witnesses as index of their credibility but upon the inherent improbability of the circumstances deposed to by the defendant 's witnesses.
It is observed by the High Court that the trial Judge, when he found the defendant 's story to be improbable, should have considered whether or not there were improbable features in the plaintiff 's case also, and whether the evidence of the plaintiff and his servant Buddhu Lal merited credence at all.
The learned Judges of the High Court then proceed to examine and discuss at great length the different reasons put forward by the trial Judge in support of his finding that the defendant 's case was unreliable.
These reasons are held to be inconclusive and unsound and the High Court further found that the plaintiff 's story 788 as narrated by him and his servant is improbable and not worthy of belief.
In our opinion, the High Court 's approach to the case has not been proper and its findings are unsupportable on the materials in the record.
Here was a case where the controversy related to a 'pure question of fact which had to be determined by weighing and appraising of conflicting oral testimony adduced by the parties.
It cannot be denied that in estimating the value of oral testimony, the trial Judge, who sees and hears the witnesses, has an advantage which the appellate court does not possess.
The High Court was wrong in thinking that it would detract from the value to be attached to a trial Judge 's finding of fact if the Judge does not expressly base his conclusion upon the impressions he gathers from the demeanour of witnesses (1).
The duty of the appellate court in such cases is to see whether the evidence taken as a whole can reasonably justify the conclusion which the trial court arrived at or whether there is an element of improba bility arising from proved circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, outweighs such finding.
Applying this principle to the present case, we do not think that the High Court was justified in reversing the finding of the trial Judge on the question of attestiation of the document.
In the opinion of the High Court the story narrated by the plaintiff and his servant is untrue, and the main reason given is that it is not at all probable that the plaintiff and not his father Bhikhi Ram was present at the palace of the Raja when the document was executed.
The mortgagor, it is said, was an influential person in the locality occupying a very high social position and it would be indecorous and against Indian customs for a man like Bhikhi Ram not to be personally present when the Raja was going 'to execute a document in his favour.
The learned Judges seem to think that the plaintiff was not really at the spot when the mortgage deed was executed and as Bhikhi Ram was dead, this story was manufactured by the plaintiff in order to Vide the observations of Lord Carson in Nether landsche Handel Maatschappij v, R.M.P. Chettiar Firm and Others, A.I.R 1929 P.O. 202, 205.
789 enable him to prove attestation.
Mr. Banerjee appearing for the defendant respondent went to the length of suggesting that it was only after Harbhajan Lal turned hostile in the witness box and denied that he attested the document that the new story was invented by the plaintiff.
We think that this argument rests on an extremely flimsy basis which does not bear examination.
It may be that the Raja was a man of high social position, but it should be remembered that he was in the position of a borrower and moreover it was not the first time that he was borrowing money from Bhikhi Ram.
As, however, he was the Raja of Basti, the document was executed at his palace and not in the house of the mortgagee and if as the plaintiff says, the terms were already settled between Bhikhi Ram and the Raja and the only thing left was to embody the agreed terms in writing, we fail to see why it was absolutely necessary for Bhikhi Ram to wait upon the mortgagor personally; and why his adult son, who was sufficiently old and experienced in business affairs, could not represent him in the transac tion.
The suggestion of Mr. Banerjee that the new story was invented after the plaintiff had seen Harbhajan Lal giving evidence against him in the witness box is not worthy of serious consideration having regard to the fact that the plaintiff himself stepped into the witness box immediately after Harbhajan Lal had finished his deposition.
It seems to us also that the presence of Harbhajan Lal and Buddbu Lal at the sitting when the mortgage transaction took place was quite a probable and natural thing which cannot give rise to any suspicion.
It appears from the evidence on the record that Harbhajan Lal, who was a pro fessional deed writer, was usually employed for writing deeds of the plaintiff 's father and he figured either as a scribe or as an attesting witness in various documents to which the plaintiff 's father was a party.
It was quite natural for the plaintiff in such circumstances to take Harbhajan Lal alongwith him to the Raja 's palace on the day that the 790 mortgage bond was executed and we see no reason to disbe lieve the plaintiff 's statement that his original intention was to have the deed scribed by Harbhajan Lal.
It is said by the High Court that in the mofussil districts in the United Provinces the Patwari is the person generally em ployed for drafting and scribing deeds.
This cannot mean that all the people in the district of Basti used to have their deeds drafted and scribed by the Patwari.
We have exhibited documents in the records of this case where the name of Harbhajan Lal appears as the scribe; and so far as the plaintiff 's father was concerned, there is no doubt whatsoever that Harbhajan Lal was the scribe ordinarily employed to do his work.
In this case also if Jawala Prasad Patwari had not been present on the spot, the plaintiff would certainly have the document scribed by Harbhajan Lal, as so many documents in favour of the plaintiff 's father had been scribed by this man on previous occasions.
We see nothing improbable in the story that it was out of deference to the wishes of the Raja that the plaintiff consented to the document being scribed by Jawala Prasad Patwari.
As regards Buddhu Lal, it is not disputed that he was an old and a trusted servant of the plaintiff 's family.
That he was trusted in business matters is clear from the fact that his name appears as a witness in the registered receipt (exhibit 10) given by Sheo Balak Ram, to whom a sum of Rs. 500 was paid by Bhikhi Ram under the terms of the dis puted mortgage deed.
We fail to see why it was improbable that Buddhu Lal would accompany the plaintiff to the Raja 's palace on the day of the execution of the document.
The trial Judge relied to some extent upon the fact that the signatures of the executant and Harbhajan Lal were in the same ink in support of his conclusion that Harbhajan Lal signed the document at the place of its execution and not at the Collectorate Kutchery as alleged by him.
Speak ing for ourselves, we do not attach much importance to the similarity in the ink which is after all not a very reliable test; but we do agree wit.h the trial Judge in holding that Harbhajan 791 Lal must have signed the document at the time when it was executed and not afterwards; and it is really inconceivable that an old and experienced deed writer like him did not know the requirements of proper attestation.
On his own evidence he had attested numerous documents and he could not recall.
a single instance where he signed the document in such manner as he did in the present case.
The ' way in which the learned Judges of the High Court have attempted to explain away this part of Harbhajan Lal 's evidence does not appear to be satisfactory.
The other observation made by the High Court in this connection that in this particular province there are many persons who are acquainted with law but do not care to comply with its requirements on account of carelessness, indifference, sloth or over confidence is not relevant and need not be taken seriously.
Whatever that may be, we have no hesitation in holding that Harbhajan Lal knew perfectly well what attestation means in law and he did sign the document as an attesting witness at the Raja 's Kot after the document was executed.
Jawala Prasad Patwari is apparently a man under the control of the defendant and cannot be trusted.
Why Harbha jan Lal did go over to the defendant 's side is a question which may not admit of an easy answer.
The trial Judge seems to be of opinion that it was probably due to the influence exercised by Jawala Prasad Patwari, who is a co villager of Harbhajan.
We think it unnecessary to specu late upon these matters, for in our opinion Harbhajan Lal stands condemned by his own statement in court.
Our conclusion is that the finding of the trial Judge on the question of attestation is perfectly consistent with the circumstances and probabilities of the case and the learned Judge did not omit anything which ought to have been present to his mind in coming to a conclusion.
The evidence on the record taken as a whole fully supports the finding, and in our opinion the High Court has reversed it on totally inade quate grounds.
The result is that the appeal must be allowed and the judgment of the High Court should be 792 set aside.
As the High Court, however, has dismissed the suit only on the ground of non attestation of the mortgage bond and did not consider the other points which were raised before it, the case must go back to that court in order that the other matters, which have been left undecided, may be heard and decided by the learned Judges and the case dis posed of in accordance with law.
The plaintiff appellant is entitled to costs of this hearing as well as the costs of the High Court against defendant No. 1.
Appeal allowed.
","When there is conflict of oral evidence of the parties on any matter in issue and the decision hinges upon the credibility of the witnesses, then unless there is some special feature about the evidence of a particular witness which has escaped the trial judge 's notice or there is a sufficient balance of improbability to displace his opinion as to where the credibility lies, the appellate court should not interfere with the finding of the trial judge on a question of fact.
It would not detract from the value to be attached to a trial judge 's finding of fact if the judge does not express ly base his conclusion upon the impressions he gathers from the demeanour of witnesses.

The Court delivered judgment as follows.
FAZL ALI J.
These appeals arise out of an execution proceeding, and the main point to be decided in them is what is the effect of certain provisions of the Madras Agricul turists ' Relief Act (Madras Act IV of 1938, which will hereinafter be referred to as ""the Madras Act""), on the rights of the parties.
How this point arises will be clear from a brief statement of the facts of the case.
It appears that in 1908, one Veeresalingam, the husband of the first respondent, borrowed a sum of Rs. 9,000 from one Sitharamayya, and executed a mortgage bond in his fa vour.
Subsequently a suit was 808 instituted by the mortgagee to enforce the mortgage and a final decree in that suit was passed on the 19th August, 1926.
Thereafter, on the 28th October, 1931,the decree holder applied for the execution of the decree by the sale of the mortgaged property.
In 193a, the decree holder transferred the decree to one Sobhanadri, after whose death his son, the appellant before us, was brought on the record as his legal representative in the execution proceedings.
Several years before the assignment of the decree, Veeresa lingam, the defendant, had died and his widow, the first respondent.
was therefore brought on the record as his legal representative.
On the 6th July, 1935, two items of proper ty were sold in execution of the decree and purchased by the decree holder, these being : (1) a village called Tedlam in in West Godavari District; and (2) 4 acres and 64 cents of land in Madepalli village.
The first property was sold for Rs. 21,000 and the second for ' Rs. 1,025.
As, however, the amount due under the decree was only about Rs. 17,860 and odd, the sale of the second property was subsequently set aside and the decree holder deposited into Court the excess amount of about Rs. 3,000 and odd after setting off the decretal amount against the price of the first item of property.
On the 5th August, 1935, the first respondent filed an application under Order XXI, rule 90, and section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure, to set aside the sale held in July, 1935, alleging certain irregularities in the conduct of the sale.
That application was after several years heard by the Subordinate Judge of Ellore, who by his order dated the 6th March, 1943, dismissed it and directed the sale of the first property to be confirmed and full satisfaction of the decree to be entered.
After about 12 days, i.e., on the 18th March, 1943, the first respondent and the second respondent, who had been adopted by the former on the 12th March, 1936, under the will of her hus band and was subsequently brought on record, filed an appli cation under section 19 of the Madras Act praying for cer tain reliefs under that Act.
This application ' was dismissed on the 22nd March, 1943.
Subsequently, two appeals were filed on behalf 809 of the respondents (who will hereinafter be sometimes re ferred to as judgment debtors), one against the order refus ing to set aside the sale under Order XXI, rule 90 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the other against the order dis missing the application under the Madras Act.
These appeals were heard together by two learned Judges of the Madras High Court and they took the view that the judgment debtors ' application under the Madras Act was maintainable notwith standing the fact that the sale had been confirmed and full satisfaction of the decree recorded, and remitted the case to the trial Court for a finding on the following questions, namely (1) whether the applicants were agriculturists; and (2) if so, what would be the result of applying the provisions of Madras Act IV of 1938 to the decretal debt against them ? So far as regards the judgment debtors ' appeal against the order dismissing their application under Order XXI, rule 90, the Learned Judges were inclined to agree with the trial Court that the sale should stand but declined to pass final orders in the appeal on the ground that ""it would seriously prejudice the judgment debtors in the connected application for relief under section 19 of the Madras Act IV of 1938.
"" The Subordinate Judge answered the questions referred to him by the High Court on remand as follows : (1) The judgment debtors were not agriculturists and were not therefore entitled to the benefits of the Madras Act;and (2) If they were agriculturists, they were not liable to pay anything under the decree, as, in view of the provisions of the Act, the debt stood discharged on the date of sale.
When however the matter came up before the learned Judges of the High Court, they reversed the first finding of the trial Court and held that the judgmentdebtors were agriculturists within the meaning of the 810 Act, and that the debt stood discharged in view of section 8 (2) of the Act.
At the same time, they held that the sale was not liable to be set aside, and in this view dismissed one of the appeals and allowed the other.
Then followed certain proceedings to which it would have been unnecessary to refer but for the fact that the judgment debtors have attempted to rely on ""them in support of one of their preliminary objections to the maintainability of these appeals.
It appears that on the next day after the judgment of the High Court was delivered in the two appeals, counsel for the respondents wrote a letter to the Registrar of the High Court to direct the posting of the two cases 'for being mentioned ' before the Court in order to obtain necessary directions consequent on the orders passed by it in the appeals.
This letter was not placed before the learned Judges until the judgment had been signed by them and ac cordingly the judgment debtors filed two petitions, one being a review petition to the High Court and the other being a petition to the trial Court praying ""that the de creeholder may be ordered to pay to the petitioners the purchase money of Rs. 21,000 with interest thereon at 6 per cent.
per annum from the date of sale till the date of payment.
"" The trial Court dismissed the latter petition on the ground that it was not maintainable, and the judgment debtors filed an appeal against the order.
The appeal as well as the review petition of the judgment debtors were heard together by the learned Judges who directed the decree holder 's counsel to elect whether his client would deposit the purchase money into Court or have the sale set aside.
The decree holder applied for a short adjournment and ultimately on the 15th November, 1946, his counsel stated that his client wished to retain the property which he had purchased and to pay the purchase money into Court.
Thereupon, he was directed to pay the sum of Rs. 21,000 together with interest within a months from that date.
Subsequently, the appellant (decree holder) having obtained leave to appeal from the High Court preferred 811 these appeals before us.
It may be stated here that along with the application for leave to appeal, the appellant had filed an application for excusing the delay in filing the former application which he accounted for mainly by refer ring to the proceedings for the review of the judgments in the previous appeals to the High Court.
This application was granted and the delay was condoned.
As has been already stated, the main point arising in these appeals relates to the effect of the Madras Act upon this litigation.
That Act was passed and came into effect in 1938, while the execution proceedings were still continu ing.
It will be recalled that the sale took place on the 6th July, 1935; and the application for setting it aside was not disposed of until the 6th March, 1943.
But, strangely enough, the judgmentdebtors did not apply for any relief under the Madras Act during this period, and they made their application only after the sale had been confirmed and satisfaction of the decree had been entered.
How far this belated application affects the right claimed by the judg ment debtors under the Act is one of the questions raised in these appeals, and I shall deal with it after referring to the material provisions of the Act and the findings of the High Court which have given rise to several debatable points.
The sections of the Act which are material for the purpose of these appeals are sections 3, 8 and 19.
Section 3 defines an agriculturist and has a proviso stating that in certain cases a person shall not be deemed to be an agricul turist.
The relevant clause of this proviso, to which I shall also have to advert later, is clause (D) which runs thus : ""Provided that a person shall not be deemed to be an 'agriculturist ' if he (D) is a landholder of an estate under the Madras Es tates Land Act, 1908, or of a share or portion thereof in respect of which estate, share or portion any sum exceeding Rs. 500 is paid as peshkash or any sum exceeding Rs. 100 is paid as quit rent, jodi, kattubadi, 812 poruppu or the like or is a janmi under the Malabar Tenancy Act, 1929, who pays any sum exceeding Rs. 500 as land reve nue to the Provincial Government. ' ' The precise question which is said to arise with refer ence to this provision is whether by reason of being the owners of village Tedlam, the judgment debtors should be held to be not entitled to relief under the Act.
The other material sections 8 and 19 run as follows : ""8.
Debts incurred before the 1st October, 1932, shall be scaled down in the manner mentioned hereunder, namely: (1) All interest outstanding on the 1st October, 1937, in favour of any creditor of an agriculturist whether the same be payable under law, custom or contract or under a decree of Court and whether the debt or other obligation has ripened into a decree or not, shall be deemed to be dis charged, and only the principal or such portion thereof as may be outstanding shall be deemed to be the amount repay able by the agriculturist on that date.
(2) Where an agriculturist has paid to any creditor twice the amount of the principal whether by way of princi pal or interest or both, such debt including the principal, shall be deemed to be wholly discharged.
(3) Where the sums repaid by way of principal or inter est or both fall short of twice the amount of the principal, such amount only as would make up this shortage, or the principal amount or such portion of the principal amount as is outstanding, whichever is smaller, shall be repayable.
(4) Subject to the provisions of sections 22 to 25, nothing contained in sub sections (1), (2) and (8) shall be deemed to require the creditor to refund any sum which has been paid to him, or to increase the liability of a debtor to pay any sum in excess of the amount which would have been payable by him if this Act had not been passed.
813 Explanation.
Where a debt has been renewed or included in a fresh document in favour of the same creditor, the principal originally advanced by the creditor together with such sums, if any, as have been subsequently advanced as principal shall alone be treated as the principal sum repay able by the agriculturist under this section.
Where ' before the commencement of this Act, a Court has passed a decree for the repayment of a debt, it shall, on the application of any judgmentdebtor who is an agricul turist or in respect of a Hindu joint family debt, on the application of any member of the family whether or not he is the judgment debtor or on the application of the decree holder, apply the provisions of this Act to such decree and shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, amend the decree accordingly or enter satisfaction, as the case may be: Provided that all payments made or amounts recovered, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, in respect of any such decree shall first be applied in payment of all costs as originally decreed to the creditor.
"" These sections are material, because in the present case the judgment debtors asked the decree to be amended under section 19 of the Act and they were held to be entitled to relief under section 8.
Having referred to the relevant provisions of the Act, it becomes necessary now to state the main findings of the High Court upon which the decision of this appeal will turn.
These findings are (1) that the sale of Tedlam village, which was held on the 6th July, 1935, and confirmed on the 6th March, 19 13, was a good sale; (2) that by this sale.
the title to the Tedlain village passed to the decree hoMer.
and in hearing the appeal the High Court was justified in proceeding on the footing that the judgment debtors having ceased to be the owners of Tedlam village after its sale, were not 104 814 hit by clause (D) of the proviso to section a of the Act; and (3) that the decree had been satisfied at the date of the sale and the decree holder was liable to repay to the judg ment debtors the full price of the property which was sold.
The main contentions directed against the conclusions arrived at by the High Court are :firstly, that they are self contradictory, because if the sale was an effective sale on the date it was held or confirmed, the decree was also satisfied on that date and the judgmentdebtors were no longer entitled to invoke the provisions of the Madras Act; and secondly, that the view taken by the learned Judges of the High Court that notwithstanding the appeal against the order refusing to set aside the sale they could proceed on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlarn village on the date of the sale was un sound in law.
It will first deal with the second point which appears to me to require serious consideration.
The High Court has in my opinion rightly proceeded on the footing that the ownership of Tedlam village would bring the judgment debtors within the mischief of clause (D) of the proviso to section 3 of the Act, and would disentitle them to any relief thereunder.
This view was contested before us on behalf of the judgment debtors on two grounds : (1) that the grant in favour of the ancestor of the judgment debtors did not comprise a whole inam village and what they owned was therefore not an estate under the Madras Estates Land Act (Madras Act I of 1908); (2) that on the date of the application, the judg ment debtxrs were not landholders of village Tedlam because the village was in the possession of a receiver since 1st February, 1937, and the latter was in law the landholder on the crucial date.
None of these contentions however appears to me to have any force.
The first contention was sought to be supported by Exhibit P 1 which is a register of inams and which shows that poramboke or waste lands to the extent of 596 acres had to be deducted from the area 815 of the inam.
The point however has been dealt with very fully and clearly by the learned Subordinate Judge, who has rightly pointed out that it has no force in view of the Madras Estates Land (Amendment) Act, 1945 [Madras Act No. II of 1945].
The second point is equally unsubstantial, be cause it is well settled that the owner of a property does not cease to be its owner merely because it is placed in the hands of a receiver.
The true position is that the receiver represents the real owner whoever he may be, and the true owner does not by the mere appointment of a receiver cease to be a landholder under the Madras Estates Land Act.
I will now revert to the crucial question in the case, viz., whether the learned Judges of the High Court were justified in law in deciding the appeal on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlain village and on that account they were not hit by clause (D).
of the proviso to section 3 of the Madras Act.
At this stage, it will be useful to refer to certain provisions of the Civil Procedure Code which directly bear on the question as to when title to immovable property which is sold in execution of a decree is deemed to pass to the purchaser.
One of the provisions is Order XXI, rule 92, which provides that ""where no application is made under rule 89, rule 90 or rule 91, or where such application is made and disallowed, the Court shall make an order confirming the sale, and thereupon the sale shall become absolute.
"" The second rele vant provision is section 65 which runs thus : ""Where immovable property is sold in execution of a decree and such sale has become absolute, the property shall be deemed to have vested in the purchaser from the time when the property is sold and not from the time when the sale becomes absolute.
"" In Bhawani Kunwar vs Mathurn Prasad Singh(1) the ques tion as to when a mortgagee who has purchased certain vil lages in execution of the decree acquired title to the properties purchased by him directly arose for considera tion, and the Privy Council rightly pointed (1) T.L.R. 816 out that ""the sale in execution of the mortgage decree took effect from the actual date of the sale and not from its confirmation."" In a simple case, the provisions cited above should settle the controversy, but, in the present case, the matter has been complicated on account of the appeal against the order refusing to set aside the sale under Order XXI, rule 90.
In such a case, generally speaking, the true position seems to be that there is no finality until the litigation is finally determined by the appellate Court.
This principle has been recognized in a number of cases, but it will be enough to cite Chandramani Shaha vs Anarjan Bibi(1).
The headnote of that case runs as follows : ""Where a Subordinate Judge has disallowed an applica tion under Order XXI, rule 90, to set aside a sale in execu tion, and has made an order under rule (1) confirming the sale, and an appeal from disallowance has been dismissed by the High Court, the three years ' period provided by the Indian Limitation Act, 1908, Schedule I, article 180, for an application under Order XXI, rule 95.
by the purchaser for delivery of possession runs from the date of the order on appeal; the High Court having under the Code of Civil Proce dure, 1908, the same powers as the Subordinate Judge, the 'time when the sale becomes absolute ', for the purpose of article 180 is when the High Court disposes of the appeal."" Under article 180 of the Indian Limitation Act, the period of limitation runs ""from the date when the sale becomes absolute.
"" If we give a narrow and literal meaning to these words, the period of limitation should be held to run from the date when the original Court of execution confirms the sale.
But, as was pointed out by the Privy Council, the High Court as an appellate Court had the same powers as the trial Court and it is only when the appeal was dismissed by the High Court that the order of the trial Court confirming the sale became absolute.
Till the deci sion of the appellate Court, no finality was attached to the order confirming the sale.
(1) I.L.R. 61 Cal.
g45. 817 It is clear that in this case the same rule would apply to the order recording satisfaction of the decree and to the order confirming the sale.
If the order recording satisfac tion of the decree was not final and remained an inchoate order until the appeal was decided, the order confirming the sale would have the same inchoate character.
This position seems to have been fully conceded in the statement of their case filed on behalf of the respondents in this Court.
It is quite clear that in this case the learned Judges of the High Court have taken up an inconsistent position.
As I have already stated, they have held, for the purpose of allowing one of the appeals, that the judgment debtors were not hit by clause (D)of the proviso to section 3 of the Act because they ceased to be the owners of Tedlain village at the date of the sale in 1935.
If this conclusion is cor rect, it must follow as a matter of logic that the decree was completely satisfied on the date of the sale, because the sale fetched a larger amount than what was payable under the decree and the excess amount was deposited by the de cree holder in Court.
The sale and satisfaction must go together and if finality is to be attached to the sale it should have been held to attach also to the order recording satisfaction of the decree.
It seems clear to me that if the decree had ceased to exist, no relief could be claimed by the judgment debtors under the Madras Act.
On the other hand, if the appeal had to be decided on the footing that the order recording satisfaction of the decree was not final, the same approach should have been made in regard to the effect of the sale.
It is also clear that if the decree was satisfied on the date of sale by the application of the provisions of the Act, the sale could not stand, because how could the property be sold in execution of a decree which had been already satisfied.
Yet, notwithstanding the fact that nothing was due under the decree, the High Court has held that the sale was a good sale and was to stand.
The correct approach to the case would have been to assume for the purpose of the appeals that neither of the orders passed by the 818 Subordinate Judge was final.
On that view, the appeals to the High Court could not have been decided on the footing that the judgment debtors had ceased to be the owners of Tedlain property and were therefore not hit by clause (D) of the proviso to section 3 of the Madras Act.
In my opinion, the judgment of the High Court cannot be sustained, and the appeal s will have to be allowed.
I will now deal very briefly with two preliminary objec tions raised on behalf of the respondents.
The first objec tion is that the application for leave to appeal to his Majesty in Council against the order of the High Court was barred by limitation, inasmuch as the reasons stated in the affidavit filed by the appellant in the High Court in sup port of his application for excusing delay do not consti tute sufficient reason within the meaning of section 5 of the Limitation Act.
The answer to this objection will be found in the facts which have been already narrated.
The delay was caused mainly by reason of the review of the order of the High Court and the High Court considered that there as sufficient reason for condoning the delay.
This Court cannot override the discretion exercised by the High Court and the matter cannot be reopened in these appeals.
The second objection is based on the fact that the decree holder was given a choice by the High Court to elect wheth er he would deposit the purchase money or have the sale set aside, and his counsel told the learned Judges on the 15th November, 1946 that his client wished to retain the property which he had purchased and pay the purchase money in cash.
It is contended that in view of this statement it was not open to the appellant to contend that he need not pay any amount to the judgment debtors.
This objection also is entirely devoid of any substance,because there is nothing on record to show that the appellant has consented to be bound by the order of the High Court and waived his right to appeal against it by reason of the election.
The learned counsel for the respondents also contended that the sale should have been set aside by the 819 High Court because the permission given to the decreeholder on the 16th February, 1934, to bid and set off the decretal amount against the purchase price was confined to an earlier sale and did not extend to the sate which took place on the 16th March, 1935, after the upset price which had been originally fixed was reduced.
Personally, I am inclined to hold that the permission covered the sale in question, but in any case it is difficult to hold on the facts stated that there was any such material irregularity as would vitiate the sale.
The precise argument which is put forward here was advanced in the Courts below but it did not find favour either with the Subordinate Judge or with the High Court.
Besides, the respondents cannot raise the point in these appeals because they have filed no appeal against the order of the High Court upholding the sale.
In these circumstances, I would allow the appeals, set aside the orders of the High Court and restore the order of the learned Subordinate Judge.
There will however be no order as to costs in these appeals.
MUKHERJEA J. I concur in the judgment just now deliv ered by ray learned brother, Fazl Ali J., and there is nothing further which I can usefully add.
CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
The facts which have cha given rise to these appeals and the questions for decision have been stated in the judgment just now pronounced by my learned brother Fazl Ali J. I wish to add only a few words on the main contention advanced for the respondents by their learned Advocate, Mr. V. Rangachari.
If by reason of the confirmation of sale and satisfac tion of the decree having been entered up, the title to the village had passed indefeasibly to the decreeholder, there was no longer any decree or decree debt to be scaled down.
If, however, the title did not pass, because it was still open to the respondents to attack the Court sale under Order XXI, rule 90, they were landholders of the village and, as such, they would 820 come within the scope of proviso (D) to section 3 of the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act, 1938, which enacts that a landholder who holds a village paying more than Rs. 100 as quit rent or jodi is not an agriculturist within the meaning of the Act.
The apparent inconsistency in the view taken by the High Court was recognised, if not conceded, by the learned coun sel.
In one view, there ,,as no longer any decree in respect of which the Agriculturists ' Relief Act could operate; and in the other view, the respondents could not take advantage of the Act, as their ownership of the village precluded them.
Faced with this dilemma, Mr. Rangachari urged a some what ingenious argument.
He contended that though the.
title passed to the decree holder on the confirmation of sale and became vested in him from the date of the sale, the respo dents could still be regarded as having an interest in the village, as the sale was open or liable to challenge and the title 'of the decree holder was inchoate or incomplete.
There is, however, really no support for this position.
On confir mation, the title of the decree holder became absolute or complete.
If the sale was set aside, the title would revest in the judgment debtor.
There is nothing like an equitable title in the decree holder which could be recognised for certain purposes and not recognised for others.
Under the Madras Act, ""agriculturist"" means ""a person who has a saleable interest in any agricultural or horticul tural land or one who holds interest in such land under a landholder as a tenant, ryot or undertenure holder."" Section 10, sub clause (i) of the Act provides that the right conferred on an agriculturist to have a debt scaled down will not apply to any person who, though an ""agriculturist"" as defined in the Act, did not on 1 10 1937 hold an interest in or a lease or sub lease of any land.
After the sale in 1935, the only interest which the judgment debtors had in the village was to have the sale set aside, under the rele vant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code.
This interest is not the interest contemplated by section 3, sub clause (ii) (a) & (b) of the Act which speaks of a 821 saleable interest or interest as a tenant, ryot or underten ure holder.
I agree in the conclusion reached by my learned broth er.
Appeals allowed.
","In execution of a decree obtained on a mortgage a vil lage owned by the mortgagor which was included in the mort gage was sold by the court on the 6th July 1935 and it was purhased by the mortgagee.
An application by the mortgagor under 0 .XXI,.r. 90, C.P.C., for setting aside the sale for irregulrities was dismissed, the sale was confirmed and full satisifiction of the decree was recorded, on the 6th March 1943.
A few days afterwards the mortgagor and his adopted son made an application under section 19 of the Madras Agricul turists ' Relief Act, 1938, praying for relief under the Act, and, as this application also was dismissed they preferred two appeals, one from the order dismissing this application and the other against the order of 6th March 1943 refusing to set aside the sale.
The High Court of Madras held that, as the mortgagor 's village had been sold he did not come within the purview of el.

(i)that the conclu sions arrived at by the High Court were self contradictory because if the sale was effective on the date it was held or confirmed, the decree was also satisfied on that date and the judgementdebtors were no longer entitled to invoke the provisions of the Act; (ii) that the High Court was not justified in law in deciding the appeal on the footing that the judgment debtors ceased to be owners of the village from the date of sale and on that account were not hit by cl.

807 Per CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
After the execution sale in 1935 the only interest which the judgment debtors had in the village was to have the sale set aside under the relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code and this interest, not being an interest contemplated by section 3 (ii) (a) & (b) and section 19 (1) of the Act, they were not ""agriculturists"" and were not entitled to any relief under the Act.

PATANJALI SASTRI J.
This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court of Judicature in West Bengal reversing a finding of the Second Subordinate Judge of 24 Parganas at Alipore that he had jurisdiction to proceed with a suit after substituting the Province of East Bengal (in Pakistan)in the place of the old Province of Bengal against which the suit had originally been brought.
The facts leading to the institution of the suit are not in dispute.
The Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act was passed by the Provincial Legislature of Bengal in 1944.
It applied to the whole of Bengal and purported to bring under charge the agricultural income of, inter alia, ""every Ruler of an Indian State."" Acting under the provisions of that Act, which came into force on 1st April, 1944, the Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, sent by registered post, a notice to the Manager of the Zemindari Estate called Chakla Roshanabad belonging to the Tripura State but situated in Bengal outside the territories of that State, calling upon him to furnish a return of the total income derived in the 5 previous year from lands in the Estate used for agricultural purposes.
The notice was received by the Manager at Agar talla in Tripura State.
Thereupon, the State, by its then Ruler, Maharaja Sir Bir Bikram Bahadur, instituted the suit in question on 12th June, 1945, against the Province of Bengal and the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, in the Court of the First Subordinate Judge, Dacca, contest ing the validity of the notice and the proposed assessment on the grounds that the ""Provincial Legislature of Bengal had no authority to impose tax on any income of an Indian State or its Ruler"" and that, in any case, ""the Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, had no authority or jurisdiction to issue the said notice to the Manager of the Estate outside British India.
"" The cause of action of the suit was alleged to have arisen in the town of Dacca within the jurisdiction of the Court on 28th February, 1945, when the notice was issued.
The reliefs sought were a declaration that the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act: 1944, in so far as it purported to impose a liability to pay agricultural income tax on the plaintiff as a Ruler of an Indian State was ultra vires and void and that, in any case, the notice served by the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, was void and no assessment could be made on the basis of such notice, and a perpetual injunction to restrain the defendants from taking any steps to assess the plaintiff to agricultural income tax.
Before the defendants filed their written state ments the suit was transferred by the High Court to the Court of the District Judge, 24 Parganas, and was again transferred from that Court to the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore.
The ruler who brought the suit having died, the plaint was amended by the substitution in his place of his son and heir in June 1947, and the suit was pending in that Court when the partition of India took effect on the 15th August, 1947 On 9th December, 1947, the Province of East Bengal filed a petition stating that the Province of Bengal, the original defendant No. 1 in the suit, had ceased to exist with effect from 15th August, 1947, and 6 in lieu thereof two new Provinces, namely, the Province of East Bengal and the Province of West Bengal had come into existence and that, inasmuch as the Province of West Bengal was taking no interest in the suit, it was necessary in the interests of East Bengal that the suit should be contested and that a written statement should be put in on its behalf for such contest.
It was accordingly prayed that the ' delay should be condoned and the written statement which was filed with that petition should be accepted.
In the written statement it was pleaded that inasmuch as the Province of East Bengal was a Province of the; Dominion of Pakistan and that defendant No. 2 was a Revenue officer of that Province, the Court had no jurisdiction to hear the suit or make an order of injunction against the defendants.
It was stated that the Province of East Bengal appeared only to contest the jurisdiction of the Court.
By another written statement filed on the same day defendant No. 2 raised also other pleas in defence but his name was struck off the record at the plaintiff 's instance as not being a necessary party to the suit.
On the 10th December, 1947, the Province of East Bengal was substituted as the defendant in the place of the Province of Bengal which had ceased to exist, and the writ ten statement filed on behalf of the former was accepted.
Thereupon the Subordinate Judge framed a preliminary issue on the question of jurisdiction and, as stated al ready, found it for the plaintiff relying on section 9 of the Indian Independence Act and article 4 of the Indian Inde pendence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947.
It may be men tioned in passing that the assessment of the plaintiff was proceeded with by the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Comilla Range (East Bengal), who, by his order dated the 22nd December, 1947, imposed on the plaintiff a tax of Rs. 1,79,848 12 0 for 1944 45 and Rs. 1,34,326 7 0 for 1945 46, but the recovery of the amounts has been deferred under orders of the Court pending the decision on the preliminary issue.
As pointed out by the Federal Court in Midnapore 7 Zemindary Co. Ltd. vs The Province of Bengal and ,Others (1), the orders promulgated on the 14th August, 1947, by the Governor General of India before the partition in exercise of the powers conferred under section 9 of the Indian Independ ence Act, 1947, and containing provisions specially designed to remove the difficulties arising in connection with the transition to the new situation created by the partition are binding on both the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan.
Among such Orders those relevant to the present controversy are the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, and the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities)Order, 1947.
By article 4 of the former Order (1) All proceedings pending immediately before the appointed day in any of the special tribunals specified in col. 1 of the Schedule to this Order shall be continued in that tribunal as if the said Act had not been passed, and that tribunal shall continue to have for the purposes of the said proceedings all the jurisdiction and powers which it had immediately before the appointed day; * * * * (3) Effect shall be given within the territories of either of the two Dominions to any order or sentence of any such Special Tribunal as aforesaid and of any High Court in appeal or revision therefrom as if the order or sentence had been passed by a court of competent jurisdiction in that Dominion; * * * * and by article 12 (2) of the latter Order Where any Province from which property, rights or li abilities are transferred by this Order is, immediately before the transfer a party to legal proceedings with re spect to that property or those rights or liabilities the Province which succeeds to the property, rights or liabili ties in accordance with the provisions of this Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the other Province as a party to those proceedings and the proceedings may continue accordingly.
(1) 8 On the effect of these provisions the learned Judges of the High Court observed: ""If this provision [i.e., article 12 (2)] applies to the present case, there can be no doubt that the Province of East Bengal was substituted in the suit for the Province of Bengal by operation of law, and by reason of the Legal Proceedings Order the suit shall continue in the Court of the Second Subordinate Judge, 24 Parganas, as a suit against the substituted defendant.
"" With that statement of the position we entirely agree.
The learned Judges, however, proceeded to examine, laying stress on the words ""by this Order"" in article 12 (2), whether any property, rights or liabilities could be said to have been transferred by the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, from the Province of Bengal to the Province of East Bengal, and they took the view that neither any property, nor rights, nor liabilities were so transferred under that Order and that, therefore, the con tinuation of the proceedings against the Province of East Bengal, which was now part of an Independent Sovereign State, was governed by the principles of international law and comity of nations, and that, according to those princi ples, East Bengal, being a Province of a sovereign state, could not be sued against its will in the municipal courts of India, with the result that the suit pending in the Court at Alipore must abate.
They also negatived a further con tention raised before them, apparently for the first time, to the effect that by reason of the petition filed on behalf of the Province of East Bengal for acceptance of its written statement condoning the delay involved and also by reason of sundry other proceedings for interim relief sought by the plaintiff which were actively resisted by the Province of East Bengal, that Province must be taken to have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Court.
On behalf of the appel lant, Mr. Sen Gupta challenged the correctness of the deci sion on both points.
Before dealing with these contentions, it will be con venient to dispose of two preliminary points raised by Mr. Faiyaz Ali, Advocate General of East Bengal.
9 In the first place, he submitted that the State of Tripura having since been merged in the Dominion of India and a Chief Commissioner having been appointed to administer its territories, the appeal could no longer be prosecuted by the present Maharaja through his mother as his next friend.
It was, however, represented to us on his behalf that under the agreement of merger the Estate of Chakla Roshanabad was left to the Maharaja as his personal property and it no longer formed part of the territories of the Tripura State.
The Attorney General, appearing on behalf of the Dominion of India, the intervener, confirmed that position.
There is thus no substance in the objection as any formal defect in the proceeding could be set right by suitably amending the cause title.
Mr. Faiyaz Ali next drew our attention to the Pakistan (Indian Independence Legal Proceedings) Order, 1948, promul gated by the Governor General of Pakistan on 13th November, 1948, with retrospective effect from the 15th August, 1947, and pointed out that in view of its provisions any decree that might eventually be passed by the Court at Alipore would receive no effect in Pakistan and that, therefore, it was unnecessary for this Court to decide the question of the jurisdiction of the Alipore Court to proceed with the suit.
We are unable to take that view.
The effect of the Order referred to above on any decree that may eventually be passed in the pending suit may have to be taken note of by the Court trying that suit after hearing arguments on the validity of that Order which is challenged but we are at present concerned only with the question of the jurisdic tion of that Court to try the suit and we cannot at this stage refuse to give our ruling on that question merely because any decree that might be passed in favour of the plaintiff might prove ineffectual.
Turning now to the main question, it is clear that article 12 (2) of the Rights, Property and Liabilities Order applies only to property rights or liabilities which were transferred by the Order from a Province which was a party to legal proceedings 2 10 ""with respect to"" that property or those rights or liabili ties.
As the suit in question cannot be said to have been instituted with respect to the property transferred, namely, Chakla Roshanabad, the appellant cannot rely upon the trans fer of that property from the Province of Bengal to the Province of East Bengal as part of the territories of Pakistan under the scheme of partition.
Nor was there any transfer of ""rights""such as was contemplated under that article, for the only right with respect to which the Prov ince of Bengal could be said to have been a party to the pending proceeding on the facts of this case was the right to tax the agricultural income of the plaintiff under the provisions of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944, and that right was not derived by the Province of East Bengal by transfer under the Rights, Property and Liabili ties Order.
As rightly pointed out by the High Court, the right of taxation under the Bengal Act of 1944 passed to the Province of East Bengal as part of the Sovereign Dominion of Pakistan by virtue of the provisions of section 18(3) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, which provided that ""the law of British India and of the several parts thereof immediate ly before the appointed day shall, so far as applicable and with the necessary adaptations, continue as the law of each of the new Dominions and the several parts thereof, until other provision is made by the laws of the legislature of the Dominion in question or by any other legislature or other authority having power in that behalf.
"" The question next arises whether there was a transfer of any ""liability"" by the Order as contemplated in article 12(2).
Mr. Sen Gupta relied in this connection on article 10 (2) (a) which provides that ""where immediately before the appointed day the Province of Bengal is subject to any such liability (i.e., ""any liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than breach of contract"") referred to in sub section (1)that liability shall, where the cause of action arose wholly within the territories which, as from that day, are the territories of the Province of East Bengal, be a liability of that Province.
"" It was contended that the Province 11 of Bengal was, according to the plaintiff 's case, liable to be restrained from proceeding with the illegal and unautho rised assessment on the basis of the notice issued under the Bengal Act of 1944, and that liability, in respect of which the cause of action arose wholly in Dacca (where the as sessment proceeding had been initiated) within the territo ries of the Province of East Bengal, became a liability of that Province.
The High Court rejected this contention on the ground ""that article 10(2) is concerned with the liabil ity for an actionable wrong other than breach of contract and it is impossible to say that by serving a notice on the plaintiff under the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act through one of its officers the Province of Bengal had committed an actionable wrong '.
Assuming that it exceeded its power or acted under an invalid provision of law, the plaintiff may have a declaration to that effect but the Act complained of cannot be said to have been a tortious act.
But even assuming that it was, it is to be remembered that the issue of the notice was an exercise of powers conferred by the Act in relation to the sovereign rights of the Crown and it is elementary that the Crown or the State is not answerable for even negligent or tortious acts of its offi cers done in the course of their official duties imposed by a statute, except where the particular act was specifically directed and the Crown profited by performance . .
No liability for an actionable wrong is thus involved in the suit and Dr. Sen Gupta cannot establish a right to proceed against the Province of East Bengal on the basis that the liability was transferred to that Province under article 10(2) of the Order.
"" We are unable to share 'this view.
The learned Judges have placed much too narrow a construction on the phrase ""liability in respect of an actionable wrong"".
They have assumed that the phrase connotes only a liability for dam ages for a completed, tortious act and that the initiation of what according to the plaintiff was an unauthorised and illegal assessment proceeding by purporting to serve a notice requiring the plaintiff to submit a return of his total agricultural income under section 24 (2) of the Bengal Agricultural 12 Income tax Act, 1944, through an appropriate officer func tioning under that Act, the Province of Bengal had not committed an ""actionable wrong"".
This, in our opinion, is not a correct view of the matter.
Under section 9(1) (b) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the Governor General of British India was directed to make provision by order ""for dividing between the new Dominions and between the new Provinces to be constituted under this Act, the powers, rights, property, duties and liabilities of the Governor General in Council or as the case may be of the relevant Provinces which under this Act are to cease to exist"", and the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order is the only Order by which such provision was made.
The intention being thus to provide for the initial distri bution of rights, property and liabilities as between the two Dominions and their Provinces, a wide and liberal con struction, as far as the language used would admit, should be placed upon the terms of the Order, so as to leave no gap or lacuna in relation to the matters sought to be provided for.
There is no reason, accordingly, why the words ""li ability in respect of an actionable wrong"" should be under stood in the restricted sense of liability for damages for completed tortious acts.
We consider that the words are apt to cover the liability to be restrained by injunction from completing what on the plaintiff 's case was an illegal or unauthorised act already commenced.
The service of the notice on the plaintiff under section 24(2) of the Bengal Act amounts to much more than a mere threat in the abstract to impose an illegal levy.
It is the actual initiation of an illegal assessment proceeding which, in the normal course, will 'in all probability culminate in an illegal levy of tax.
The failure to make a return as required by the notice would result under section 25(5) of the Act in the Income tax Officer making an ex parte assessment to the best of his judgment and determining the sum payable by the assessee on the basis of such assessment.
Such failure would also expose the plaintiff under section 32(1) of the Act to the impo sition of a penalty which may equal the amount of the tax assessed on him or to a prosecution as for an offence 13 before a Magistrate under section 53 (1), at the option of the Income tax authority.
It is thus plain that the service of a notice requiring a return of income to be furnished for assessment under the Act is a step fraught with serious consequences to the assessee, and if the assessment proposed was illegal and unauthorised by reason of the Act itself being ultra vires in so far as it purported to make the Rulers of Indian States liable to taxation thereunder as contended for by the plaintiff, the service of such notice marked the commencement of a wrongful act against the plain tiff by the Bengal Government under colour of the Act and there can be no doubt that such a wrongful act is actionable in the sense that an action would lie in a civil court for an injunction restraining its completion.
That was the liability to which the Province of Bengal was subject ac cording to the plaintiff 's case at the time when he insti tuted the suit, and that liability, in our opinion, passed to the Province of East Bengal by virtue of article 10 (9.) (a) of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabil ities) Order, 1947.
There is no question here of the li ability of the Crown for damages for the negligent or tor tious act of its officers.
On the allegations in the plaint, which must, for the purpose of deciding the question of jurisdiction as a preliminary issue, be assumed to be well founded, the Province of Bengal was undoubtedly liable to be sued for an injunction restraining it from proceeding with the assessment and none the less so because the notice was served in purported exercise of powers conferred by the Bengal Act.
The name of the Income tax Officer originally impleaded as the second defendant having been struck off the record, no question in regard to his liability arises.
Reference was made to certain text books where a ""tort"" is spoken of as an ""actionable wrong"" and it was suggested that the two expressions are synonymous.
Every tort is undoubtedly an actionable wrong but the converse does not necessarily follow.
Indeed, the words ""other than breach of contract"" used in article 10 (1) make it plain that the expression ""actionable wrong"" is used in a wider sense 14 which would have included breach of contract but for those limiting words.
It was said that even assuming that the service of the notice calling for a return of income was a wrongful act, it was not ""actionable"", as section 65 of the Bengal Act barred suits in civil courts ""to set aside or modify any assessment made under this Act"".
The short answer to this contention is that the suit in question is not a suit ""to set aside or modify an assessment"" made under the Act, as no assessment had yet been made when it was instituted, and the subsequent completion of the assessment was made by the Pakistan In come tax authorities on terms agreed to between the parties and sanctioned by the Court.
The decision of the Privy Council in Raleigh Investment Co. Ltd. vs Governor General in Council (1) relied on in support of the contention is distinguishable, as the main relief claimed there was repay ment of the tax alleged to have been wrongfully levied under colour of an ultra vires provision in the Indian Income tax Act.
Their Lordships observed: ""In form the relief claimed does not profess to modify or set aside the assessment.
In substance it does, for repayment of part of the sum due by virtue of the notice of demand could not be ordered so long as the assessment stood.
Further, the claim for the declaration cannot be rationally regarded as having any relevance except as leading up to the claim for repayment, and the claim for an injunction is merely verbiage.
The cloud of words fails to obscure the point of the suit.
"" The position here is entirely different.
The gist of the wrongful act complained of in the present case is sub jecting the plaintiff to the harassment and trouble by commencing against him an illegal and unauthorised assess ment proceeding which may eventually result in an unlawful imposition and levy of tax.
It was suggested, somewhat faintly, that the cause of action for the suit, though stated in the plaint to have arisen in Dacca, now in the Province of East (1) 15 Bengal, did not arise wholly within the territories of the Province of East Bengal within the meaning of Article 10 (2) (a) inasmuch as the notice calling for a return, though issued from Dacca, was received by the Manager of the Estate at Agartalla in Tripura State.
Assuming that the contention has any substance it is of no assistance to the respondent, for article 10 (2) (c) would then be applicable to the case and the Province of East Bengal would still be liable, though jointly with the Province of West Bengal.
We are therefore of opinion that the Province of East Bengal having succeeded to the liability to which the Province of Bengal was subject immediately before the ap pointed day, the former Province is to be deemed to be substituted for the other Province as a party to the suit and the suit must accordingly continue in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore, which has jurisdiction to proceed with it under article 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947.
In this view it is unnecessary to consider the question of submission to jurisdiction urged in the alternative by the appellant.
In the result the appeal is allowed, the order of the Court below is set aside and the suit now pending in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore will be heard and determined by it.
The respondent will pay the appellant 's costs throughout.
FAZL ALI J.
The question to be decided in this appeal is whether the Subordinate Judge 's Court at Alipore in the State of West Bengal, has jurisdiction to try a suit in which the Province of East Bengal was impleaded as a defend ant, after the 15th August,1947 In what circumstances this question has arisen will appear from the facts of the case which may be briefly stated.
In 1944, the Bengal Legislature passed an Act called the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944 (Bengal Act IV of 1944), which enabled it to impose a tax on the agricul tural income of various classes 16 of persons including ""every Ruler of an Indian State,"" holding lands within the territory of Bengal.
The appel lant, who is the Ruler of the State of Tripura, holds a zamindary called Chakla Roshanabad Estates, which was situ ated in the Province of Bengal and in the District of Sylhet formerly appertaining to the Province of Assam.
On the 28th February, 1945, the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, issued a notice under section 24 (2) of the Bengal Act to the Manager of the Chakla Roshanabad Estates calling upon him to furnish a return of the appellant 's total agri cultural income for the previous year, derived from lands situated within the Province of Bengal.
On the 12th June, 1945, the appellant instituted a suit in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Dacca, against the Province of Bengal and the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, claim ing the following reliefs: (1) For a declaration that the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944, so far as it imposes a liability to pay agricultural income tax on the plaintiff is ultra vires and void and that the plaintiff ' is not bound by the same.
(2) For a declaration that in any case the notice served by the Agricultural Income tax Officer, Dacca Range, above referred to, is void and of no effect and that no assessment can be made on the basis of that notice.
(3) For a perpetual injunction to restrain the defend ants from taking any steps to assess the plaintiff to agricultural income tax.
On the 15th July, 1945, the suit was transferred to the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Alipore in the District of 24 Parganas, by an Order of the Calcutta High Court.
While the suit was still pending, the new Province of East Bengal, which forms part of the territories of the Dominion of Pakistan, came into existence on the 15th August, 1947, as a result of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, and it appears that the whole of Chakla Roshanabad Estates falls within that Province.
After the creation of the new Province, 17 a petition was filed on the 9th December, 1947, on behalf of the Province of East Bengal, drawing the attention of the Court at Alipore to the fact that the Province of West Bengal, which forms part of the territories of the Dominion of India, was taking no interest in the suit and asking the Court to accept a written statement which was also filed along with the petition, and in which the only plea taken was that the Alipore Court had no jurisdiction to hear the suit or make any order of injunction against the Province of East Bengal or defendant No. 2.
The last paragraph of the written statement was to the following effect: ""The Province of East Bengal appears only to contest the jurisdiction of the court and it submits that the suit should be dismissed on that ground.
"" Later on, the Province of East Bengal was irapleaded as a defendant in the suit and the name of the Income tax Officer of Dacca was removed from the category of defend ants.
The Subordinate Judge then proceeded to try the question of jurisdiction as a preliminary issue, and decided that by virtue of the provisions of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, read with section 9 of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the Court had jurisdiction to try the suit against the new Province.
Thereupon, the respondent (the Province of East Bengal) moved the High Court at Calcutta under section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, against the order of the Subordinate Judge, and a Bench of the High Court consisting of Harries C.J. and Chakravarthi J. allowed the application and set aside the order of the Subordinate Judge, giving effect to the objec tion of the respondent that the Court at Alipore was not competent to try the suit against the Province of East Bengal.
One of the points raised on behalf of the appellant before the High Court was that the Province of East Bengal had submitted to the jurisdiction ' of the Subordinate Judge 's Court, but this point was negatived.
The appellant was thereafter granted a certificate under section 205 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, and on the basis of it he has preferred this appeal.
18 On a reference to the judgments of the learned Subordi nate Judge and the High Court, it appears that three provi sions were relied upon by the appellant in support of his contention that the Court at Alipore had jurisdiction to try the suit, these being section 9 of the Indian Independ ence Act, 1947, article 4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, [hereinafter referred to as 'the Legal Proceedings Order '], and section 12 of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, Therein after referred to as ' the Rights, etc., Order '].
These provisions run as follows : Section 9 of the Indian Independence Act : ""The Governor General shall by order make such provi sion as appears to him to be necessary or expedient (a) for bringing the provisions of this Act into effective operation; (b) for dividing between the new Dominions, and be tween the new Provinces, to be constituted under this Act, the powers, rights, property, duties and liabilities of the Governor General in Council or, as the case may be, of the relevant Provinces which, under this Act, are to cease to exist . . "" Section 4 of the Legal Proceedings Order : ""Notwithstanding the creation of certain new Provinces and the transfer of certain territories from the Province of Assam to the Province of East Bengal by the Indian Independ ence Act, 1947, (1) all proceedings pending immediately before the appointed day in any civil or criminal court (other than a High Court) in the Province of Bengal, the Punjab or Assam shall be continued in that court as if the said Act had not been passed, and that court shall continue to have for the purposes of the said proceedings all the jurisdiction and powers which it had immediately before the appointed day; (2) any appeal or application for revision in respect of any proceedings so pending in any such 19 court shall lie in the court which would have appellate, or as the case may be revisional, jurisdiction over that court if the proceedings were instituted in that court after the appointed day; and (3) effect shall be given within the territories either of the two Dominions to any judgment, decree, order, or sentence of any such court in the said proceedings, as if it had been passed by a court of competent jurisdiction within that Dominion.
"" Section 12 of the Rights, etc.
Order : ""(1) Where immediately before the appointed day, the Governor General in Council is a party to any legal proceed ings with respect to any property, rights or liabilities transferred by this Order, the Dominion which succeeds to the property, rights or liabilities in accordance with the provisions of this Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the Governor General in Council as a party to the pro ceedings, and the proceedings may continue accordingly.
(2) Where any Province from which property, rights or liabilities are transferred by this Order is, immediately before the transfer, a party to legal proceedings with respect to that property or those rights or liabilities, the Province which succeeds to the property, rights or liabili ties of this Order shall be deemed to be substituted for the other Province as a party to those proceedings, and the proceedings may continue accordingly.
(3) Any proceedings which, immediately before the ap pointed day, are pending by or against the Secr","The Income tax officer, Dacca, acting under the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944, sent by registered post a notice to the Manager of an Estate belonging to the Tripu ra State but situated in Bengal, calling upon the latter to furnish a return of the agricultural income derived from the Estate during the previous year.
The notice was received by the Manager in the Tripura State.
The State, by its then Ruler, instituted a suit in June, 1946, against the Province of Bengal and the Income tax Officer, in the court of the Subordinate Judge of Dacca for a declaration that the said Act in so far as it purported to impose a liability to pay agricultural income tax on the plaintiff was ultra vires and void, and for a perpetual injunction to restrain the defend ants from taking any steps to assess the plaintiff.
The suit was subsequently transferred to the Court of the Subor dinate Judge of Alipore.
The partition of India under the Indian Independence Act took place on the 158h August 1947, and the 2 Province of East Bengal in which the Estate was situated, was substituted as a defendant in the place of the Province of Bengal on an application made by it, and in its written statement it contended that the court of Alipore which was situated in West Bengal had no jurisdiction to proceed with the suit.
The High Court of Calcutta, reversing the order of the Subordinate Judge of Alipore held that the provisions of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947, and the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabili ties)Order, 1947, did not apply to the case and, as the matter was accordingly governed by the rules of internation al law, the court of Alipore had no jurisdiction to proceed with the suit: Held per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ.
(FAZL ALI J. concurrinG) The suit was not one with respect to any property transferred to East Bengal by the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, nor was it a suit in respect of any ""rights"" transferred by the said Order, inasmuch as the Province of East Bengal obtained the right to levy income tax not by means of any transfer under the said Order, but by virtue of sovereign rights which were preserved by section 18 (3) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, and article 12 (2) of the said Order had no application to the case.
Held per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA AND CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.J. (FAZL ALI J, dissenting.) (i) Since the object of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabilities) Order, 1947, was to provide for the initial distribution of rights, properties and liabili ties as between the two Dominions and their Provinces, a wide and liberal construction, as far as the language used would admit, should be placed upon the Order, so as to leave no gap or lacuna in relation to the matters sought to be provided for.
The words ""liability in respect of an action able wrong"" should not therefore be understood in the re stricted sense of liability for damages for completed acts, but so as to cover the liability to be restrained by injunc tion from completing what on the allegations in the plaint are illegal or unauthorised acts which have been commenced.
As the Province of Bengal was, on the: allegations in the plaint, liable to be restrained from proceeding with an illegal assessment, that liability was, accordingly, a liability in respect of ""an actionable wrong other than breach of contract"" with in the meaning of article 10 (2) (a) of the above said Order; and, as the cause of action arose wholly in Dacca within the Province of East Bengal, that liability passed to the province of East Bengal under article 10 (2) (a), the latter must be deemed to be substituted as a party to the suit and the suit must continue in the court of the Subordinate Judge of Alipore, under Art.4 of the Indian Independence (Legal Proceedings) Order, 1947.
(ii) Assuming that the cause of action did not wholly arise 3 in Decca, article 10 (9.) (c) would apply and the Province of East Bengal would still be liable, though jointly with the Province of West Bengal.
(iii) As the suit was not one ""to set aside or modify any assessment made under the Act"", section 65 of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944, had no application and the suit was therefore one in respect of an ""actionable"" wrong within the moaning of article 10 (2) (a).
Per FAZL ALI J.
The words ""liability in respect of an actionable wrong other than breach of contract"" in article 10 of the Indian Independence (Rights, Property and Liabili ties) order 1947, refer to liability capable of being ascer tained in terms of money such as liability for damages for tort and not liability in any abstract or academic sense.
Even if a meaning, as wide ' as they can bear in a legal context, is given to the words ""actionable wrong"" and ""liability"" two elements are necessary to constitute an actionable wrong, namely, (i) an act or omission amounting to an infringement of a legal right of a person or breach of duty towards him, and (ii) damage or harm resulting there from.
The mere issuing of a notice under section 4 of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944, by the Income tax Officer is not an actionable wrong because no right known to law is infringed thereby and no action for damages can be main tained in respect of such an act, even assuming that the Income tax Officer had exceeded his powers or acted under an invalid provision of law.
No ""liability for an action able wrong"" was thus involved in the suit and no liability in respect of such a wrong could therefore be said to have been transferred to the Province of East Bengal within the meaning of article 10 (2.) of the said Order so as to entitle the plaintiff to continue the suit against the Province of East Bengal under article 10 (2).
For the purpose of understanding the full scope of section 65 of the Bengal Agricultural Income tax Act, 1944 it is necessary also to read the latter part which provides that no suit or other proceeding shall lie against any officer of the Crown for anything in good faith done or intended to be done under the Act.
"" The latter part of the section clearly excludes the jurisdiction of the courts to prevent the Income tax Officer from proceeding with an assessment which has been started and the section must on a fair construction be held to bar all suits in connection with such assessment whether against the State or an Income tax Officer of the State.
If, therefore, no suit or action lies, there cab be no liability for an actionable wrong.

I have read the judgment prepared by my brother, Mahajan J., and generally agree with his conclu sions and reasonings, but, having regard to 54 the importance of the points raised, I wish to add a short judgment of my own.
There are really three questions to be decided in this appeal, and they are as follows : (1) Whether the Bombay City Civil Court Act, 1948 (Act XL of 1948), is ultra vires the Legislature of the State of Bombay; (2) Whether in any event section 4 of the above Act is ultra vires the State Legislature; and (3) Whether the Bombay High Court has jurisdicion to try the suit.
The first and the third questions have been answered by the High Court in favour of the appellant and the second question has been answered in favour of the respondents.
In this Court, the appellant attacked the judgment of the High Court in so far as it concerns the second question, whereas the first respondent attacked it in so far as it concerns the first and the third questions.
The Bombay City Civil Court Act purports to create in additional civil court for Greater Bombay having jurisdic tion to try, receive and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding a certain value, subject to certain exceptions which need not be referred to here.
It was contended on behalf of the respondents that the Act is ultra vires the Legislature of the State of Bombay, because it confers jurisdiction on the new court not only in respect of maters which the Provincial Legislature is compe tent to legislate upon under List II of the 7th Schedule to the Government of India Act, 1935, but also in regard to matters in respect of which only the Central or Federal Legislature can legislate under List I (such as, for in stance, promissory notes, which is one of the subjects mentioned in entry 28 of List I).
To understand this argu ment, it is necessary to refer to entry 53 of List , entries 1 and 2 of List II and also entry 15 of List II.
These entries run as follows : Entry 53, List I : 55 ""Jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Feder al Court, with respect to any of the matters in this List . ."" Entries 1 and 2, List II : ""1 . the administration of justice;constitution and organisation of all courts except the Federal Court . "" ""2. Jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Federal Court, with respect to any of the matters in this List . "" Entry 15, List III : ""Jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Feder al Court, with respect to any of the matters in this List.
"" The respondents ' contention may appear at the first sight to be a plausible one, but, in my opinion, it is not well founded in law.
For the purpose of correctly deciding the question raised, we must first try to understand the meaning of the following items in entry 1 of List II, ""administration of justice, constitution and organization of all courts except the Federal Court.
"" A reference to the three Legislative Lists shows that ""administration of jus tice"" is entirely a provincial subject on which only the Provincial Legislature can legislate.
The same remark ap plies to ""constitution and organization of all courts except the Federal Court.
"" The expression ""administration of jus tice"" has a wide meaning, and includes administration of civil as well as criminal justice, and in my opinion entry 1 in List II, which I have quoted, is a complete and self contained entry.
In this entry, no reference is made to the jurisdiction and powers of courts, because the expressions ""administration of justice"" and ""constitution and organi zation of courts"", which have been used therein without any qualification or limitation, are wide enough to include the 'power and jurisdiction of courts, for how can justice be administered if courts have no power and jurisdiction to administer it, and how can courts function without any power or jurisdiction.
Once this fact is clearly 56 grasped, it follows that, by virtue of the words used in entry 1 of List II, the Provincial Legislature can invest the courts constituted by it with power and jurisdiction to try every cause or matter that can be dealt with by a court of civil or criminal jurisdiction,and that the expression ""administration of justice"" must necessarily include the power to try suits and proceedings of a civil as well as criminal nature, irrespective of who the parties to the suit or proceeding or what its subject matter may be.
This power must necessarily include the power of defining, enlarging, altering, amending and diminishing the jurisdiction of the courts and defining their jurisdiction territorially and pecuniarily.
The question then arises as to the exact meaning of entry 2 of List II and entry 53 of List I, which are said to militate against the above construction.
These entries, in my opinion, confer special powers on Provincial and Central Legislatures, as opposed to the general power conferred on the Provincial Legislature by entry 1 of List II, the spe cial powers being the logical consequence or concomitant of the power of the two Legislatures to legislate with regard to the matters included in their respective Legislative Lists.
The effect of these entries is that while legislating with regard to the matters in their respective Legislative Lists, the two Legislatures are competent also to make provisions in the several Acts enacted by them, concerning the jurisdiction and powers of courts in regard to the subject matter of the Acts, because otherwise the legisla tion may not be quite complete or effective.
The words used in entry 2 of List II and entry 53 of List I are wide enough to empower the two Legislatures to legislate negatively as well as affirmatively with regard to the jurisdiction of the courts in respect of the matters within their respective legislative ambits.
In other words, they can exclude or bar the jurisdiction of the courts in regard to those matters, and they can also confer special jurisdiction on certain courts.
They can also, apart from the general power which the courts usually exercise, confer power on the courts to 57 pass certain special orders, instances of which I shall give later.
In this connection, reference may be made to section 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that ""the Courts shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature ' excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred.
"" This section obviously postulates among other things the barring of the jurisdiction of the civil courts by Legislatures with respect to particular classes of suits of a civil nature, and the statute book abounds in instances in which the jurisdiction of the civil courts is barred under Acts passed by the Central and Provincial Legislatures.
There are also many Acts providing that any suit or proceed ing concerning the subjects matters of those Acts shall be triable by the court or courts specified therein.
Such provisions are to be found in a number of Acts enacted both prior to and after the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935, and there can be no doubt that the British Par liament while enacting that Act was fully aware of the existing legislative practice obtaining in this country as well as of the fact that the provisions in question were sometimes necessary and therefore it empowered the Central and Provincial Legislatures to make them under entry 53 of List I and entry 2 of List II, respectively.
This, in my opinion, is the true meaning of these entries, and it also explains why a separate entry was necessary enabling the two Legislatures to legislate with regard to the power and jurisdiction of the courts in respect of the subject matters mentioned in the three Legislative Lists.
But for an express provision like that made in the entries referred to above, the two Legislatures might not have been able to confer special jurisdiction on the courts in regard to the matters set out in the Legislative Lists, nor could they have been able to bar the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts in regard to them, however necessary or desirable such a course might have appeared to them.
8 58 It should be noted that the words used in these entries are: ""jurisdiction and power"".
""Power"" is a comprehensive word, which includes all the procedural and substantive powers which may be exercised by a court, but the full significance of the use of the word in the context can be grasped only by reading a large number of local and special Acts in which power has been given to Courts to pass certain special and unusual orders.
For example, section 13 of the Indian , provides that "" where any person is convicted of an offence punishable under any rule made under clauses . the Court by which he is convicted may direct that the aircraft or arti cle or substance, as the case may be, in respect of which the offence has been committed, shall be forfeited to His Majesty.
"" Reference may also be made to section 24 of the Indian Arms Act, 1878, which provides that ""when any person is convicted of an offence punishable under this Act, committed by him in respect of any arms, ammunition or military stores, it shall be in the discretion of the convicting Court or Magistrate further to direct that the whole or any portion of such arms, ammunition or mili tary stores, and any vessel . . . shall be confiscated."" (See also section 10 of the [Act I of 1944], and section 13 of the Food Adul teration Act, 1919 [Bengal Act VI of 1919], which are in similar terms, and the various Acts relating to money lend ers and money lending which confer special power on the courts of reopening several kinds of transactions for the relief of debtors.) It seems to me that the word ""power"" was added to the word ""jurisdiction"", in entry 53 of List I, entry 2 of List II, and entry 15 of List III, in order to enable the two Legislatures to grant special powers like those I have mentioned to the courts which are to deal with the subject matter of any special legislation.
A reference to the Acts passed after the enactment of the Government of India Act, 1935, will show that 59 special provisions with regard to the jurisdiction of courts have been made even after the passing of that Act, in a large number of Central and local Acts.
Confining ourselves to the Acts passed by the Bombay Legislature, since we are concerned here with one of such Acts, we find that in The Bombay Probation of Offenders Act, 1938 (Bombay Act No. XIX of 1938), section a empowers the following courts ""to exer cise powers under the Act, (a) the High Court, (b) a Court of Session, (c) a District Magistrate, (d) a Sub Divisional Magistrate, (e) a salaried Magistrate . "" Similarly, in the Bombay Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1939, sec tion 23 provides that ""no offence under this Act . shall be tried by a Court other than that of a Presidency Magistrate, or a Magistrate of the First Class or a Magis trate of the Second Class specially empowered in this be half.
"" Section 11 of the Bombay Cotton Control Act, 1942, provides that ""no criminal court inferior to that of a Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate of the Second Class shall try any offence under this Act"".
Section 19 of the Bombay Sales of Motor Spirit Taxation Act, 1946, and section 5 of the Bombay Harijan Temple Entry Act, 1947, are provi sions which exclude the jurisdiction of courts under certain circumstances.
Similar instances may be multiplied from the Acts of the Central Legislature and other Provincial Legis latures, but, in my opinion, the instances I have quoted are sufficient to show (1) that the practice which prevailed before the Government of India Act has continued even after its enactment, and (2) that the words ""jurisdiction and powers"" have been consistently construed to bear the meaning which I have attributed to them.
The interpretation which is sought to be put on the entries by the respondent is in my opinion open to the following objections : (1).It involves the curtailment of the meaning of the expression ""administration of justice"" in such a way as to rob it of its primary content the jurisdiction and powers of the court, without which justice cannot be administered.
60 (2) It makes it necessary to read entry 2 of List II as part of entry 1 of the same List, though it has been sepa rately numbered as an independent entry.
This is opposed to the scheme followed in the three Legislative Lists, which seems to be that each particular entry should relate to a separate subject or group of cognate subjects, each subject or group of subjects being independent of the others (subject only to incidental overlapping).
The construction suggested by the respondents makes it necessary to assume that though according to their line of reasoning the words ""jurisdiction and powers of courts, etc.
"" occurring in entry 2 of List II should have been put in entry 1 of the same List, being intimately connected with the subject of ""admin istration of justice and the constitution and organization of courts"", it was without any apparent reason numbered separately and made an independent entry.
(3) The suggested construction would exclude from the jurisdiction of the Provincial Courts a large number of matters which normally come before courts exercising civil or criminal jurisdiction and, if it is accepted, the courts will not be able to function in the fullest sense unless both the Provincial and Central Legislatures have by piece meal legislation or otherwise exhausted their power of legislating on all the subjects comprised in Lists II and I respectively.
Even after they have exhausted such power, the courts will not be able to deal with important matters, such as contracts, transfer of property, arbitration, wills and succession, criminal law, etc., which are subjects mentioned in List III, until one of the two Legislatures has legislated in regard to those subjects, which raises two important questions: (1) Which of the two Legislatures has to do it first; and (2) How is the conflict to be avoided ? That the construction put by the respondents will lead to anomalous results which could not have been within the contemplation of the British Parliament while enacting the Government of India Act, 1935, may be illustrated by one or two examples.
Reference 61 might here be made to entry 26 of List I, which deals with ""carriage of passengers and goods by sea or by b air.
"" It should be supposed that if any of the goods carried by air are lost and a suit is instituted in regard to them, the suit will be triable by the court having jurisdiction over the matter under the Civil Procedure Code, subject to any special legislation on the subject by the Central Legisla ture, in spite of the fact that the carriage of goods and passengers by sea or by air is a subject mentioned in List I.
But, on the view propounded before us by the respondent, the Provincial civil courts will not be competent to try such a suit, unless they are empowered to do so by the Central Legislature.
In order to show to what absurd result this doctrine may be pushed, and in order to avoid the criticism of taking for granted what is in controversy, we may take a very extreme example, because the soundness of the respondents ' contention can be tested only by trying to find out what would happen if we were to stretch it to the utmost limit to which it can be stretched.
Entry 13 in List I is: ""the Banaras Hindu University and the Aligarh Muslim University."" Under entry 53 of List I, the Central Legisla ture has power to legislate in regard to the jurisdiction and powers of courts in respect of the subject matter of entry 13.
It may therefore be supposed, having regard to the wide language used in entry 13, that it is open to the Central Legislature to enact that suits in which these Universities are concerned as plaintiff or as defendant, will be triable only by the particular court mentioned in the enactment concerned and that no other court shall have jurisdiction in regard to such suits, It is difficult to think that until such a legislation is made, a court which would otherwise be the proper court, has no jurisdiction to try any suit in which one of these Universities is a party, no matter what the subject matter of the suit may be.
I am certain that the framers of the Government of India Act did not contemplate such a result.
We all know that at the date when the Government of India Act, 1935, was passed, there were in existence 62 in the different Provinces a large number of courts of law and the administration of justice throughout the Provinces was in the hands of these provincial courts.
The civil courts in the Province used to try all suits and proceedings of a civil nature which are triable under section 9 of the Civil Procedure Code, and the criminal courts used to try all criminal cases which are triable under the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The jurisdiction and power of the courts were not confined to cases in regard to the subjects stated in List II, nor were they debarred from dealing with cases relating to matters which have been assigned to List I.
The jurisdiction of the courts depended in civil cases on a ""cause of action"" giving rise to a civil liability, and in criminal cases on the commission of an offence, and on the provisions made in the two Codes of Procedure as to the venue of the trial and other relevant matters.
It seems to me that the Government of India Act, 1935, did not contem plate any drastic change in the existing system of adminis tration of justice, but what it contemplated was that that system should continue subject to future legislation by the proper Legislature; Central or Provincial, barring the jurisdiction of courts or conferring jurisdiction or power on special courts with regard to the matters included in the appropriate Legislative Lists, should there be any occasion for such special legislation.
Under the Govern ment of India Act, 1935, every Province became more or less an autonomous unit with a complete machinery for administer ing justice to the fullest extent.
In my opinion, there is nothing in the Act of 1935 to show that there was any inten tion on the part of its framers to affect the machinery so drastically as to confine it to the administration of a mere partial or truncated kind of justice relating only to mat ters specified in List II.
Mr. Setalvad, the ]earned Attorney Genera], who ap peared on behalf of the appellant, in supporting the im pugned Act, argued before us that for the purpose of decid ing this appeal, we might also refer to entry 4 List III.
His contention was that the impugned 63 Act having had the assent of the Governor General, it would be permissible to see what powers the Provincial Legislature could exercise under Lists II and III taken together.
If the course which he suggests is adopted, then the subjects on which the Provincial Legislature can legislate would be: (1) administration of justice; (2)constitution and organiza tion of courts; and (3) civil procedure, including all matters included in the Code of Civil Procedure at the date of the passing of the Government of India Act, 1935.
One of the matters included in the Civil Procedure Code is the jurisdiction of courts, Section 9 of the Code provides, as I have already stated, that the courts shall have jurisdic tion to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred.
There are are also provisions in the Code dealing with the territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction of the courts.
The three entries will thus cover exactly the field which is covered by item 14 of section 92 of the Canadian Constitution which comprises the following matters: ""administration of justice in the Provinces, including constitution, maintenance and organization of provincial courts both of civil and criminal jurisdiction including procedure in civil matters in those courts.
"" It has been held in Canada that the words referred to above include the power and jurisdiction of courts, and, under that item, the provincial Legislature can confer the widest power on the courts.
It seems to me that the approach suggested by the learned Attorney General is useful for testing whether entry 2 of List II was intended to be treated as the sole and only basis of the power of the Provincial Legislature to confer jurisdiction on the provincial courts and whether it was really the intention of the British Parliament to empower the Provincial Legislature to confer jurisdiction of only such a limited character as can be conferred on the provin cial courts under entry 2 of List II, if that entry is treated as a self sufficient entry.
In my opinion, the correct view is to hold that it is not necessary to call into aid either entry 4 of List III or any of the 64 provisions of the Canadian Constitution in this case, and that the words ""administration of justice; constitution and organization of courts"" are by themselves sufficient to empower the Provincial Legislature to invest a new court with all the power which has been conferred upon it by the impugned Act.
It is of course open to the Central Legisla ture to bar the jurisdiction of the new court by a special enactment with regard to any of the matters in List I, but so long as such jurisdiction is not barred, the court will have jurisdiction try all suits and proceedings of a civil nature as enacted in the Act in question.
I think that if the Provincial Legislature had merely enhanced the pecuniary jurisdiction of any of the existing civil courts there could have been no objection to that course.
Why then should there, be any objection when, instead of investing one of the existing courts with power to try suits and proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding a certain amount, the Legis lature has created a new court and invested it with the same power.
Perhaps, it will be simpler to deal at this stage with the third question, namely, whether the Bombay City Civil Court has jurisdiction to try a suit based on a promissory note.
So far as this point is concerned, the respondent bases his contention on entries 28 and 33 of List I. Entry 28 relates to ""cheques, bills of exchange, promissory notes and other like instruments"".
Entry 53, as already stated, relates to ""jurisdiction and powers of courts with respect to any of the matters in List I."" It is contended on behalf of the respondent that the effect of these two entries, when they are read together, is that no court can try a suit relating to a promissory note, unless it is invested with the jurisdiction to try such a suit by the Central Legisla ture by virtue of the power given by entry 53 of List I. The question so raised is covered by the answer to the first question, and I shall only add that the answer already given to that question finds some support in the case of Prafulla Kumar Mukherjee and Others vs Bank of Commerce Limited Khulnal (1), in which the arguments of the (1) [1947] F.C.R.28.
65 respondents before the Privy Council proceeded on the same lines as the arguments of the respondents before us.
The question raised in that case was as to the validity of the Bengal Money lenders ' Act, 1940, which limited the amount recoverable by a money lender on his loans and interests on them, and prohibited the payments of sums larger than those permitted by the Act.
The validity of the Act was questioned by the respondent Bank in certain suits brought by them to recover loans and interests alleged to be due on promisso ry notes executed by the appellants borrowers as well as in suits brought by the debtors claiming relief under the Act.
The argument put forward on behalf of the Bank was that the Bengal Legislature by the impugned Act had attempted to legislate on subjects expressly forbidden to it and expressly and exclusively reserved for the Federal Legislature, that is to say, in relation to promissory notes and banking, which are reserved for the Federal Legislature exclusively, under entries 28 and 38 respectively of List I.
On the other hand, the arguments put forward on behalf of the appellants was that the impugned Act was in pith and substance legislation dealing with money lending and that in so far as it dealt with promissory notes or banking that was only incidental or ancillary to the effective use of the admitted legislative powers of the Provincial Legislature to deal with money lending. 'This argument of the appellants was substantially accepted by the Privy Council.
The second point raised on behalf of the respondent relates to the validity of section 4 of the Act, which runs as follows : ""Subject to the exceptions specified in section 3, the Provincial Government, may by notification in the Official Gazette, invest the City Civil Court with jurisdiction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature, arising within the Greater Bombay and of such value not exceeding Rs. 25,000 as may be specified in the notification.
"" 9 66 It is contended that this section is invalid, because the Provincial Legislature has thereby delegated its legis lative powers to the Provincial Government which it cannot do.
This contention does not appear to me to be sound.
The section itself shows that the provincial Legislature having exercised its judgment and determined that the new Court should be invested with jurisdiction to try suits and pro ceedings of a civil nature of a value not exceeding Rs. 25,000, left it to the Provincial Government to determine when the Court should be invested with this larger jurisdic tion, for which the limit had been fixed.
It is clear that if and when the new court has to be invested with the larger jurisdiction, that jurisdiction would be due to no other authority than the Provincial Legislature itself and the court would exercise that jurisdiction by virtue of the Act itself.
As several of my learned colleagues have pointed out, the case of Queen vs Burah (1), the authority of which was not questioned before us, fully covers the contention raised, and the impugned provision is an instance of what the Privy Council has designated as conditional legislation, and does not really delegate any legislative power but merely prescribes as to how effect is to be given to what the Legislature has already decided.
As the Privy Council has pointed out, legislation conditional on the use of particular powers or on the exercise of a limited discretion entrusted by the Legislature to persons in whom it places confidence, is no uncommon thing, and in many instances it may be highly convenient and desirable.
Examples of such legislation abound in England, America and other countries.
As some of the American Judges have remarked, ""there are many things upon which wise and useful legislation must depend which cannot be known to the law making power and must therefore be the subject of enquiry and determination outside the halls of legislation (Field vs Clark (2).
Mr. Setalvad, the learned Attorney General who appeared on behalf of the appellant, contended that in this country even delegated legislation is (1) 3 A.C. 889.
(2) ; , 67 permissible, but I do not consider it necessary to go into that question, because the principle enunciated in Queen vs BUrah(1) is sufficient to dispose of the contention raised here.
I think that the present case stands well outside what was laid down by the Federal Court in Jitendranath Gupta vs The Province of Bihar,(2) as two of my colleagues who were parties to the majority decision in that case have pointed out.
In the result, this appeal is allowed.
PATANJALI SASTRI J.
This appeal raises the important ques tion of the constitutional validity of the Bombay City Civil Court Act, 1948 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and though I concur in the conclusion reached by the majority of my learned brothers I wish to state precisely the reasons which lead me to that conclusion.
The first respondent brought the suit in the High Court at Bombay on its orginal side for recovery of Rs. 11,704 from the second respondent on promissory notes.
Notwithstanding that the jurisdiction of the High Court to try suits cog nisable by the City Civil Court was barred under section 12 of the Act and the pecuniary limit of the jurisdiction of the latter court had been enhanced from Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 25,000 by a notification issued by the Provincial Government under section 4 of the Act, it was stated in the plaint that the High Court had jurisdiction to try the suit because the Act as well as the said notification was ultra vires and void.
In view of the constitutional issues thus raised, the State of Bombay, the appellant herein was on its own motion, made a party defendant.
The High Court (Chagla C.J. and Tendolkar J.) held (1) the Act was intra vires, but (2) that section 4 which autho rised the Provincial Government to enhance the jurisdiction of the City Court up to the limit of Rs. 25,000 amounted to a delegation of legislative power, and as such, was void and inoperative, with the result that the suit, which ex ceeded Rs. 10,000 in (1)5 I.A. 178.
(2) 68 value and was not cognisable by the City Court apart from the impeached notification, was held to have been property laid in the High Court.
Both these findings have been challenged before us as erroneous, the first by the first respondent and the second by the appellant.
On the first point, learned counsel for the first re spondent urged that section 100 of the Government of india Act, 1935, read with entries 53 of List I, 2 of List II and 15 of List III, the relevant parts of which are in identical terms, namely, ""jurisdiction and powers of all courts except the Federal Court with respect to any of the matters in this List"", conferred power on Legislatures in British India to make laws with respect to jurisdiction of courts only in relation to matters falling within their respec tive legislative fields, and that, therefore, the expres sions ""administration of justice"" and ""constitution and organisation of courts"" in entry 1 of List II, although they might be wide enough, if that entry stood alone, to include the topic of ""jurisdiction and powers of courts"", should not be construed in that comprehensive sense as such construc tion would give no effect to the limiting words in entry 2 which would then become meaningless indeed if those expres sions in entry 1 included the power to legislate with re spect to jurisdiction also, there would be no need for entry 2, while, on the other hand, without including such power, they would still have ample content, as various other mat ters relating to administration of justice and constitu tion of courts would have to be provided for, The scheme disclosed by the three separate entries in identical terms in the three lists was said to be this: The, Provincial Legislatures were to have the power of constituting courts and providing for administration of justice, but the power to invest the courts with jurisdiction was to rest with the Federal Legislature in respect of the matters mentioned in List I and with the Provincial Legislature in respect of the matters mentioned in List Ii, while both the Federal and the Provincial Legislatures were to have such power with respect to 69 the matters mentioned in List III subject to the provisions of section 107.
It was, therefore, submitted that the Act, in so far as it purported to provide by section 3 that the City Civil Court established thereunder ""shall have juris diction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding Rs. 10,000 in value and arising within Greater Bombay"" (with certain exceptions not material here) was ultra vires the Provincial Legislature, constituting as it did a direct invasion of the Federal field marked out by entry 53 of List I.
As all the three entries dealt with the same topic of jurisdiction and powers of courts, there was no room, it was said, for the application of the doctrine of incidental enroachment.
The argument is not without force.
The Bombay High Court in Mulchand vs Raman (1), which was followed by the learned Judges in the present case, and the Attorney General who adopted the same line before us, invoked the doctrine of pith and substance in answer to the argument on behalf of the respondent.
But that doctrine, while it often furn","The Bombay City Civil Court Act of 1948, an Act passed by the Provincial Legislature of Bombay, provided by section 3 that the Provincial Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, establish for the Greater Bombay a court to be called the Bombay City Civil Court, and that this court shall, notwithstanding anything contained in any law, have jurisdiction to receive, try ' and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of a civil nature nob exceeding Rs. 10,000 in value arising within Greater Bombay except certain kinds of suits which were specified in the section.
Section 4 of the Act provided that subject to the exceptions speci fied in 8. 3 the Provincial Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, invest the City Civil Court with jurisdiction to 52 receive, try and dispose of all suits and other proceedings of civil nature arising within the Greater Bombay and of such value not exceeding Rs. 25,000 as may be specified in the notification.
Section 12 barred the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court to try suits and proceedings cognizable by the City Civil Court.
In exercise of the powers conferred by section 4 the Provincial Government invested the City Civil Court with jurisdiction to receive, try and dispose of all suits and proceedings of a civil nature not exceeding Rs. 25,000 in value.
The first respondent instituted a suit in the High Court of Bombay for recovery of Rs. 11,704 on the basis of a promissory note, contending that the Provincial Legislature had no power to make laws with respect to juris diction of courts in regard to suits on promissory notes which was a matter covered by item 53 of List I, and the Bombay City Civil Court Act of 1948 was therefore ultra vires.
It was further contended on his behalf that in any event section 4 of the Act was invalid as it involved a delega tion of legislative powers to the Provincial Government and that the suit was therefore cognisable by the High Court.
Held by the Full Court. (i) that the impugned Act was a law with respect to a matter enumerated in List II and was not ultra vires; (ii)that, as the legislature had exercised its judgment and determined that the City Civil Court should be invested with pecuniary jurisdiction up to Rs. 9,5,000 and all that was left to the discretion of the Provincial Government was the determination of the conditions under which the court should be invested with the enhanced juris diction, section 4 did not involve any delegation of legislative powers but was only an instance of conditional legislation and was not ultra vires or invalid on this ground; (iii) inasmuch as the impugned Act was in pith and substance a law with respect to a matter covered by List II, the fact that it incidentally affected suits relating to promissory notes (a subject falling within items 28 and 53 of List I) would not affect its validity and the suit was accordingly not cognisable by the High.
Court.
Per FAZL ALI, MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN and MUKHERJEA JJ.
The power of the Provincial Legislature to make laws with re spect to ""administration of justice"" and ""constitution and organisation of all courts"" under item 1 of List II is wide enough to include the power to make laws with regard to the jurisdiction of courts established by the Provincial Legis lature; the object of item 53 of List I, item 9, of List II and item 15 of List III is to confer special powers on the Central and the Provincial Legislatures to make laws relat ing to the jurisdiction of courts with respect the particu lar matters that are referred to in Lists I and II respec tively and the Concurrent List, and these provisions do not in any way curtail the power of Provincial Legislature under Item I of List II to make laws with regard to juris diction of courts and to confer jurisdiction on courts established by it to try all causes of a civil nature sub ject to the power of the Central and 53 Provincial Legislatures to make special provisions relating to particular subjects referred to in the Lists.
Per PATANJALI SASTRI and DAS JJ.
The words"" adminis tration of justice"" and ""constitution and organisation of all courts"" in item 1 of List II must be understood in a restricted sense excluding from their scope ""jurisdiction and powers of courts"" as the latter subject is specifically dealt with in item 2 List II.
Item 1 of List II does not therefore by itself authorise legislation with respect to jurisdiction and powers of courts, and the legisltive power under item 9.
in regard to ""jurisdiction 'and powers of courts "", which can legitimately be exercised with respect to any of the matters in List II, can be exercised with respect to administration of justice as this is one of the matters enumerated in that List, with the result that the subject of general jurisdiction of courts is brought within the authorised area of provincial legislation; and as the Provincial Legislature is thus competant to make a law with respect to the general jurisdiction of the court, the apparent conflict with the central legislative power under item 53 of List I can be resolved by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance and incidental encroachment.
[The legislative practice which prevailed in India before 1935 was relied on in this case in support of the view that the Provincial Legislatures had power under the constitution of 1935 to invest courts constituted by them with general pecuniary jurisdiction].
Quaere: Whether it was not open to the Legislatures of India under the Government of India Act of 1935 to delegate their legislative powers to other agencies.

The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by KANIA C.J.
This is an appeal from the judgment of the High Court at Calcutta (Harries C.J. and Chatterjea J.) pronounced on a reference made to it by the Income tax Tribunal under section 66 (2) of the Indian Income tax Act.
The relevant facts are these.
The respondents are a private limited company which was brought into existence to float various companies including cotton mills.
In November, 1932, the Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. was incorporated and the respondents were appointed their managing agents.
Their remuneration was fixed at a month ly allowance of Rs. 500 and a commission of 3 per cent.
on all gross sales of goods manufactured by the Mills Company.
The fixed monthly allowance was liable to be increased in the event of the capital of the company being increased.
The details are immaterial.
It ap pears that certain hundis were drawn by one of the direc tors of the respondent company, acting in the capacity of the managing agents of the Mill Company, in the name of the Mill Company and the same were negotiated to others.
The Nath Bank Ltd. claimed payment of these hundis.
The Mill Company repudiated its liability as it appeared from the books of the Mill Company that they had not the use of the sum of Rs. 1 80,000 claimed by the Nath Bank Ltd. under the hundis.
The Nath Bank Ltd. instituted four suits 1011 against the Mill Company, in two of which the respondent company were party defendants.
The Mill Company was advised to settle the suits and the respondent company entered into an agreement with the Mill Company, the material part of the terms of which runs as follows : ""Memorandum of Agreement made between the Calcutta Agency Limited of the one part and Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. of the other part.
WHEREAS the Nath Bank Limited demanded from the Mills the payment of the sum of Rs. 1,80,000 and interest thereon AND WHEREAS the said Mills repudiated their liability in respect thereof as it appeared from the books of the said Mills that the said Mills did not have the use of the said sum of Rs. 1,80000 or any part thereof AND WHEREAS the said Nath Bank Ltd. thereupon instituted four suits in High Court being suit Nos.
1683, 1720, 1735 and 1757 of 1939 for the said aggregate sum of Rs. 1,80,000 and the interest thereon AND WHEREAS the said Mills have been advised to settle the said suits amicably AND WHEREAS the Calcutta Agency Limited by its Directors, S.N. Mitter or S.C. Mitter, having been and being still the Managing Agents of the said Mills have undertaken to reimburse the said Mills in respect of the decrees to be made in the said four suits in the manner hereinafter appearing NOW THESE PRESENTS WITNESS AND IT IS HEREBY AGREED AND DECLARED (i) That out of the commission of 3% payable by the said Mills to the said Agency under Regulation 131 of the Arti cles of Association of the Company, the Company shall have paramount lien on and deduct and set off a moiety thereof against any payment which the said Mills may make in respect of the decrees or any of them and/or costs of the said suits.
(ii) The said moiety shall be one half of the commis sion so payable less such sum as the Directors of the Mills may from time to time allow to be deducted.
"" Under the said agreement, the respondent company paid to the Mill Company Rs. 22,500made up of 1012 Rs. 18,107 as principal and Rs. 4,393 as interest in the accounting year.
The assessee company claimed this before the Income tax Appellate Tribunal as a deduction permitted under section 10 (2) (xv) of the Indian Income tax Act.
The relevant part of that section runs as follows : ""10.
(1) ""The tax shall be payable by an assessee under the head 'Profits and gains of business, profession or vocation ' in respect of the profits or gains of any busi ness, profession or vocation carried on by him ' (2) Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances, namely : (xv) any expenditure (not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee) laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such business, profession or vocation.
In the statement of the case submitted by the Tribunal after reciting the fact of the incorporation of the company and the terms of the compromise mentioned above, the argu ments urged on behalf of the assessee company have been recapitulated.
The first argument was that under the first proviso to section 7 of the Indian Income tax Act, this payment was liable to be exempted.
The Tribunal rejected that argument.
On the reference, the High Court also reject ed the same and it was not presented before us.
The next argument of the respondents was that in respect of Rs. 22,500 it was entitled to exemption under section 10(2) (xv) of the Income tax Act on the ground that the payment was an expenditure which was not in the nature of a capital expend iture or personal expenses of the applicant company but was an expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of its business.
They urged that if the applicant company did not agree to pay this amount, Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. could have brought a suit against the company to realise this amount due on the hundis which would 1013 have exposed the applicant company to the public and in order to save themselves from the scandal and maintain the managing agency they agreed to 'the deduction of of certain amounts from the managing agency commission due to it and thereby brought it within the principles of the decision of Mitchell vs
B.W. Noble Ltd.(1) The Tribunal found as facts: (1) 'I?hat the applicant company agreed to pay off the decretal amount from the remuneration which they are enti tled to get from the Basanti Cotton Mills.
(2) The decree was passed against the applicant company evidently for certain misfeasance committed by its directors and the applicant company agreed to pay it off from its remunera tion.
(3) The books of account of Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. would show that they were paying the applicant company in full its remuneration and the books of the applicant company also show that it was entitled to its remuneration in full.
(4) In the circumstances the Tribunal held that the expendi ture was not laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of carrying on the business.
(5) Besides, the Tribunal was of the opinion that in this case it was not a revenue ex penditure at all.
As the payment had to be made towards liquidation of the decretal amount the Tribunal held, in the circumstances of this case, that it was a capital payment.
On behalf of the respondent it was argued in the further alternative that the Privy Council decision in Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria 's case(2) would cover the present case.
That contention was rejected by the Tribunal.
This statement of the case prepared by the Incometax Tribunal and submitted to the High Court for its opinion was perused by the parties and they had no suggestions to make in respect of the same.
The statement of the case was thus settled with the knowledge and approval of the parties.
When the matter came before the High Court, Mr. Mitra, who argued the case for the present respondents, as shown by the judgment of the High Court, urged as follows: "" If the applicant company had not agreed to pay the amount mentioned ; 1014 in the aforesaid agreement, then the Basanti Cotton Mills Ltd. would have sued the company for the realisation of the amounts due on the hundis and it seems that there would have been no defence to the action.
This would have subjected the applicant company to the danger of public exposure and in order to save itself from the scandal and in order to main tain the managing agency, the applicant company agreed to deduct certain amounts from the managing agency commission and therefore such expenditure came within section 10(2)(xv) of the Act."" The High Court thereafter noticed several cases including Mitchell 's case(1) and towards the close of the judgment delivered by Chatterjea J. observed as follows: ""In this case it is clear that the agreement was entered into with a view to avoid the publicity of an action against the managing agents and consequent exposure and scandal andin order to maintain the managing agency so that the company could carry on its business as before.
The payment in question did not bring in any new assets into existence nor in my opinion can it properly be said that it brought into existence an advantage for the enduring benefit of the company 's trade.
The Appellate Tribunal observed that the decree was evidently passed against the appellant compa ny forcertain misfeasance by its directors and the appellant company agreed to pay it off from its remuneration .
The object of the agreement was to enable the company to remove a defect in carrying on the business of the company and to earn profits in its business.
Therefore this case is covered by the judgment of the Court of Appeal in Mitchell ' scase(1) . ""Applying this line of reasoning the High Court differed from the conclusion of the Tribunal and allowed the deduction to the respondent company under sec tion 10(2) (xv) of the Income tax Act, as claimed by the respondents.
The Commissioner of Income tax, West Bengal, has come in appeal to us.
Now it is clear that this being a claim for exemption of an amount, contended to be an expenditure falling under section 10(2)(xv), the burden of proving the (1) ; 1015 necessary facts in that connection was on the assessee, it being common ground that the commission was due and had become payable and was therefore the business income of the assessee company liable to be taxed in the assessment year.
The jurisdiction of the High Court in the matter of income tax references is an advisory jurisdiction and under the Act the decision of the Tribunal on facts is final, unless it can be successfully assailed on the ground that there was no evidence for the conclusions on facts recorded by the Tribu nal.
It is therefore the duty of the High Court to start by looking at the facts found by the Tribunal and answer the questions of law on that footing.
Any departure from this rule of law will convert the High Court into a fact finding authority, which it is not under the advisory jurisdiction.
The statement of the case under the rules framed under the Income tax Act is prepared with the knowledge of the parties concerned and they have a full opportunity to apply for any addition or deletion from that statement of the case.
If they approved of that statement that is the agreed statement of facts by the parties on which the High Court has to pronounce its judgment.
In the present case the parties perused the statement of case and as disclosed by the note made at the end of it had no suggestions to make in respect thereof.
It is therefore clear that it was the duty of the High Court to start with that statement of the case as the final statement of facts.
Surprisingly, we find that the High Court, in its judgment, has taken the argument of Mr. Mitra as if they were facts and have based their conclusion solely on that argument.
Nowhere in the statement of the case prepared by the Tribunal and filed in the High Court, the Tribunal had come to the conclusion that the payment was made by the assessee company to avoid any danger of public exposure or to save itself from scandal or in order to maintain the managing agency of the appellant company.
The whole conclusion of the High Court is based on this unwar ranted assumption of facts which are taken only from the argument of counsel for the present respondents before 1016 the High Court.
The danger of failing to recognise that the jurisdiction of the High Court in these matters is only advisory and the conclusions of the Tribunal on facts are the conclusions on which the High Court is to exercise such advisory jurisdiction is illustrated by this case.
It seems that unfortunately counsel for the respondents caught hold of Mitchell 's case(1) and basing his argument on the circum stances under which a payment could be described as a busi ness expenditure falling within the terms of section 10 (2) (xv), argued that the facts in the present case were the same.
Instead of first ascertaining what were the facts found by the Tribunal in the present case, the process was reversed and the procedure adopted was to take Mitchell 's case(1) as the law and argue that the facts in the present case covered the situation.
1n our opinion this is an entirely wrong approach and should not have been permitted by the High Court.
The High Court fell into a grave error in omitting first to ascertain what were the facts found in the case stated by the Tribunal.
The High Court overlooked that in Mitchell 's case(1) the whole discussion started with a quotation from the case stated by the Commissioners as the facts of the case.
A scrutiny of the record in the present case shows that before the Income tax Officer the assessees claimed only a deduction of the interest of Rs. 5,582 as a permissible deduction under section 10 (2) (iii) of the Income tax Act.
That claim was rejected by the Income tax Officer.
When the matter went to the Assistant Income tax Commissioner it was argued that the Income tax Officer was in error in not allowing the deduction of interest and was also wrong in not allowing the entire sum of Rs. 22,500 as a deduction on the ground that portion of the income (viz., Rs. 22,500) should be treated as not earned or deemed to be earned by the assessees at all, having regard to the decision of the Privy Council in Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria 's case(2) The first paragraph of the order of the Appellate Assistant Commis sioner contains the following 1017 statement : "" In disallowing this (interest) c]aim the Income tax Officer was following the decision of my prede cessor in his order dated the 18th March 1942 in Appeal No. 1 C 11 of 1941 42.
My predecessor observed: ""Nothing is in evidence to show that the managing agency company had sur plus money and such money was invested or that there was any need to borrow.
Thus the need to borrow is not established.
There is no doubt that money was borrowed but unless it can to proved that the borrowing is for the purpose of the business and the loan was used in the business, the interest cannot be allowed under section 10(2)(iii).
"" The second objection raised before the Appellate Assist ant Commissioner was in these terms : "" That the Income tax Officer should have allowed the said sum of Rs. 22,500 as allowable expenditure being allocation of a sum out of the revenue receipt before it became income in the hands of the assessee.
"" The wording of the objection and the argument noticed in the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner show that the contention was that this sum should be treated as not having become the income of the assessee at all because it was deducted at the source by the Mill company.
Reliance was placed for this contention on Raja Bijoy Singh Dudhuria 's case(1).
The contention was rejected.
At the third stage, when the assessee urged his contentions before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, he thought of urging as an argument that this was a permissible deduction under section 10 (2)(xv) because of the principles laid down in Mitchell 's case(2).
No evidence, it appears, was led before the Income Tax Tribunal, nor has the Tribunal recorded any findings of fact on which the principles laid down in Mitch ell 's case(2) could be applied.
The Tribunal 's conclusions of facts were only as summarized in the earlier part of the judgment.
It is therefore clear that the necessary facts required to be established before the principles laid down in MiZchell 's case( '2) could be applied, have not been found as facts in the present case at any stage of the proceedings and the High Court was in error (1) (2) ; 130 1018 in applying the principles of Mitchell 's case(1) on the assumption of facts which were not proved.
The High Court was carried away, it seems, by the argument of the coun sel and through error accepted the argument as facts.
Indeed, if it had noticed the contention urged before the Income tax Officer it would have seen at once that the argument was in a measure conflicting with that contention which was based on the footing of Rs. 1,80,000 being a loan to the assessee on which it had to pay interest, which was sought to be deducted under section 10 (2) (iii) of the Income tax Act.
In our opinion, therefore, this appeal should be allowed on the simple ground that the facts neces sary to be established by the respondents to support their claim for exemption under section 10(2)(xv)of the Indian Income tax Act have not been established at any stage of the proceedings and therefore they are not entitled to the deduction claimed.
The appeal is therefore allowed with costs here and before the High Court.
","The jurisdiction of the High Court in the matter of mooroetax references is an advisory jurisdiction and under the Incometax Act the decision of the Appellate Tribunal on facts is final unless it can be successfully assailed on the ground that thoro was 1009 no evidence for the conclusions on facts recorded by the Tribunal.
It is therefore the duty of the High Court to start by looking at the facts found by the Tribunal and answer the questions of law on that footing.
It is not proper to depart from this rule of law as it will convert the High Court into a fact finding authority, which it is not, under the advisory jurisdiction.
As the statement of tile Case prepared by the Appellate Tribunal in accodance with the rules framed under the In come tax Act is prepared with the knowledge of the parties concerned and they have full opportunity to apply for any addition or deletion from that statement, if they have approved of the statement made by the Tribunal, it is the agreed statement of facts by the parties on which the High Court has to pronounce its judgment. ' The High Court would be acting improperly if it takes the arguments one of the counsel for the assessee as if they were facts and bases its conclusion on those arguments.
One of the directors of the assessee company, acting in the capaci ty of managing agents of certain ,Mills, had drawn some hundis in the name of the Mills, and as the Mills repudiated liability, suits were filed on the hundis against the Mills and the assessees.
The assessees thereupon agreed to reim burse the Mills by permitting the latter.
to deduct a moiety of the commission payable to them under the agreement of managing agency, against payments which the Mills may have to make under the decrees.
In their assessment to income tax the assessees claimed that the amounts so deducted should be excluded from their assessable income as business expendi ture under section 10 (2,) (xv) of the incometax Act.
The Appel late Tribunal found that the assessees had agreed to pay off the decree amount from the remuneration due to them, that the decree was passed against them evidently for some mis feasance committed by their directors, that the books of both companies showed that the assesssea were paid their remuneration in full, and that the expenditure was not therefore laid out for the purpose of carrying on the busi ness, and also that, as the payment was made for the liqui dation of a debt, it was not a revenue expenditure.
In the High Court the assessees ' counsel argued, relying on the case of Mitchell vs B. W. Noble Ltd.(1), that the payments were matie by the assessees to avoid the publicity of an action against them and the consequent exposure and less of reputation as a managing agency company, and as such the payments were deductible as business expenditure.
The High Court accepted this argument and reversed the decision of the Tribunel.
Held, that the High Court acted wrongly in accepting the arguments of the assessees ' counsel as if they were proved facts and basing its decision on them; and, as the facts necessary to support the claim for exemption under section 10 (2) (xv) had not been established at any stage of the case, the assessees were not entitlecl to the deduction claimed.

December 21.
The Court delivered judgment as follows : KANIA C.J. This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court at Bombay.
Although the record is heavy and many points were argued in the trial court and in the court of appeal at Bombay, the important point argued before us is only one.
The appellants (plaintiffs) are a firm of commission agents in Bombay.
The respondents (defendants) 982 were their constituents.
Accounts between the parties in respect of their dealings were made up and settled up to the 30th of October, 1943.
Piecegoods and yarn continued to be purchased and consigned by the plaintiffs to the defendants joint family firm thereafter.
One bale of piecegoods was purchased and despatched in November, 1943.
In January, 1944, restrictions were imposed against the consignment of piecegoods and/or yarn outside Bombay by rail without.
obtaining the necessary previous permit from the Textile Commissioner at Bombay.
On or about the 8th February, 1944, Mohanlal of the defendants ' joint family firm came to Bombay and the plaintiffs purchased on their behalf 278 bales of piecegoods.
Ninetyfour out of those were despatched accord ing to the defendants ' instructions.
The plaintiffs, accord ing to the defendants ' instructions, applied for and ob tained permit to consign several more bales.
On the permits being issued they were despatched on 14th February, 1944, to destinations given by the defendants.
On the 10th April, 1944, the plaintiffs, after obtaining the necessary permits, despatched more bales as directed by the defendants.
The dispute between the parties relates to the remaining 92 bales which were stored in godown No. 424, Baroda Street, Argyle Road, Bombay, pending the receipt of permit for consigning the same On the 14th April, 1944, there occurred a big explosion in the Bombay harbour which destroyed several immovable proper ties and godowns with moveable property covering a large area near the port.
Fires were caused by the explosion and they also caused considerable destruction of moveable and immoveable properties.
These 92 bales purchased by the plaintiffs on account of the defendants were also destroyed either by the fire or the explosion.
The plaintiffs filed a suit to recover the price of these 9 '2 bales from the de fendants on the ground of the agent 's right to indemnity.
The defendants contended that the plaintiffs were their pucca adatiyas, that the property in the goods did not pass to them and that they were not liable for the price 983 till delivery of the goods was given to them.
In the alter native, in para.
4 of their written statement, they pleaded that when Mohanlal of the defendants ' firm was in Bombay and the plaintiffs stated that the goods could not be railed until permits were obtained, it was agreed between the plaintiffs and the defendants that the defendants were to pay annas four per bale per month to the plaintiffs for insurance charges and the goods were thus to remain insured till despatched according to their instructions.
In para graph 21 of their written statement, they contended that if their plea that the plaintiffs were pucca adatiyas was not accepted.
and the plaintiffs were held to be their commis sion agents, the plaintiffs were guilty of negligence and misconduct in the business of agency, as in spite of specific instructions and agreement they bad failed to insure the goods.
They contended that owing to this negli gence and misconduct the plaintiffs were not entitled to the indemnity claimed.
In the alternative they contended that the plaintiffs were liable to make good the loss caused to the defendants by their failure to insure the said bales.
They contended that they were entitled to set off this loss against the claim for the price.
They also counterclaimed the same amount if their set off was not allowed.
On these pleadings the parties went to a hearing.
Issue to covered the defendants ' plea about the plaintiffs ' negligence and misconduct in not insuring the 92 bales and the counter claim arising therefrom.
Numerous witnesses were called before the trial court and the learned judge after considering their demeanour and hearing their evidence came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs ' witnesses were unreliable, except when they were corroborated by documentary evidence.
He also disbelieved the defendants ' evidence.
He held that the agreement to insure the goods was not proved and passed a decree in favour of the plaintiffs.
On appeal, differing from the view of the trial court, the appeal court held that instruc tions were given by Mohanlal to insure the goods and that 984 the agreement was proved.
In thus differing from the trial court 's decision, they accepted the well recognised princi ple to give full weight to the trial judge 's observations about the witness.
They however found that on the documents the view of the learned trial judge was not correct.
In doing so, they principally relied on statements of account sent by the plaintiffs to the defendants in respect of bales purchased in February, 1944, and despatched by them out of the lot of 278 bales previously and where the plaintiffs had charged the defendants insurance premia at the rates men tioned in the defendants ' written statement.
They rejected the plaintiffs ' explanation, which was accepted by the trial judge, that these entries were foolishly made out of cupidity by the plaintiffs.
After a brief discussion in which this point was halt ingly urged before us, the learned counsel for the plain tiffs did not very properIy dispute this conclusion of the appeal court.
In our opinion, the finding of the appeal court, having regard to the documents, was correct.
That left for decision the important question of damages to which the respondents were entitled.
Before the appel late court in Bombay, it was conceded by the respondents ' counsel that the insurance which was to be effected by the appellants under the agreement was on the usual terms of fire insurance policies prevalent in Bombay.
Clause 7 of that form of policy, inter alia, provided as follows : ""Unless otherwise expressly stated in the policy, this insurance does not cover. (h) any loss or damage occasioned by or through or in consequence of explosion but loss or damage by explosion of gas used for illuminating or domestic purposes in a building in which gas is not generated and which does not form part of any gaswork will be deemed to be lost by fire within the meaning of this policy "" The appellants urged that granting that they were in default and had committed a breach of duty in not 985 insuring the goods according to the instructions or the agreement, the respondents could not recover anything from them due to damage arising from the explosion, because the policy of fire insurance, if taken out, would not have given to the respondents the money claimed by them.
For this purpose they relied on a statement n Mayne on Damages, (11th Ed.) at page 592, as follows : ""Therefore if an agent is ordered to procure a policy of insurance for his principal and neglects to do it, and yet the policy, if procured, would not have entitled the princi pal, in the events which have happened, to recover the loss or damage, the agent may avail himself of that as a complete defence.
"" In the present case, after the explosion considerable discussion about the liability of the insurance companies under their policies of fire insurance and the liability of Government for alleged negligence in unloading high explosives from a ship on the docks appears to have taken place.
On the 1st of July, 1944, the Governor General pro mulgated the Bombay Explosion (Compensation) (Ordinance, 1944.
The preamble to that Ordinance runs as follows: "" Whereas an emergency has arisen which makes it neces sary to provide for and regulate the payment of compensation for. damage to property due to, or arising out of, the explosions and fires which occurred in the Bombay Docks on the 14th April, 1944, to restrict litigation in connec tion with the said explosions and fires and to make certain other provisions in connection therewith.
"" The other relevant provisions may be also noticed at this stage.
Uninsured property was defined to mean property which was not covered whether wholly or partially by any policy of fire, marine or miscellaneous insurance at the time of the explosion.
After providing for the procedure according to which compensation may be claimed and dealt with by the Claims Committee to be set up under the Ordi nance and an appeal and review from their decision, section 14 provided as follows : 986 14.
""Subject to the provisions of this Ordinance, there shall be paid by the Central Government compensation for explosion damage to property being (a) damage caused by fire to property insured whether wholly or partially at the time of the explosion against fire under a policy (other than a policy of marine insur ance) covering fire risk, or damage caused by blast without fire intervening to property insured whether wholly or partially at the time of the explosion under a pollcy (other than a policy of marine insurance) covering fire and explo sion risks, of an amount equal to the proved loss, or (b) damage caused by blast without fire intervening to property insured whether wholly or partially at the time of the explosion against fire under a policy (other than a policy of marine insurance) covering fire risk but not explosion risk, of an amount equal to 871/2 per centum of the proved loss, to the holder of the policy of insurance covering the damaged property, or if he is deceased, to his legal representatives.
Section 15 provided for contribution by the insurers towards the payment of amounts to be paid under the Ordi nance.
Section 18 of the Ordinance runs as follows : 18.
(1) Nothing in this Ordinance shall prevent the recovery of compensation for death or personal injury under the (V/11 of 1923), or under any policy of life insurance or against personal accident or under any other contract or scheme providing for the payment of compensation for death or personal injury, or for damage toproperry under any policy ' of marine or miscel laneous insurance.
(2) Save as provided in sub section (1), no person shall have, or be deemed ever to have had, otherwise than under this Ordinance any right whether in contract or in tort or otherwise to any compensation or damages for any death, personal injury or damage to or loss of any property, rights or interests, due to or in any way arising out of the explo sion; and no suit or other 987.
legal proceedings for any such compensation or damages shall, save as aforesaid, be maintainable in any Court against the Crown or the Trustees of the Port of Bombay or the Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay or against any servants or agents of the Crown or of the said Trustees or Municipal Corporation or againt any other person whomso ever; and no act or omission which caused or contributed to the explosion shall be deemed to have been done or omitted to be done otherwise than lawfully.
(3) No suit, prosecution or other legal proceeding whatsoever shall lie against any person for anything in good faith done or ordered to be done in combating or mitigating the effects of the explosion, or for anything in good faith done or intended to be done in pursuance of this Ordinance or any rules or orders made thereunder.
"" It is common ground that in respect of uninsured merch andise fifty per cent.
compensation was to be paid under the Ordinance.
The appellants have recovered that amount and have now agreed to give credit of the same to the re spondents.
The dispute is in respect of the remaining fifty per cent.
It is not disputed that if the goods had been insured, under section 14 of the Ordinance, full compensa tion would have been recovered by the appellants and become payable to the respondents.
The appellants ' contention is two fold.
Firstly, that if they had insured the goods the ordinary fire insurance policy would not have covered the risk and therefore al though they had committed a breach of the agreement or been negligent in their duty as agents, they were not liable to pay anything more to the respondents.
In the alternative it was argued on their behalf that the intervention of Govern ment in passing this Ordinance could not increase or add to the liability of the appellants for the breach of contract or breach of duty and therefore they were not liable to pay the compensation which would have been receivable by the respondents if the goods had been 988 insured.
The second contention is that the counterclaim of the respondents is barred under section 18 (2) o[ the Ordi nance.
In the Indian Contract Act, sections 211 and 212 provide for the consequences of an agent acting otherwise than according to his duty towards the principal.
Under section 211 when an agent conducts the business of the principal otherwise than according to the directions given by the principal, ii any loss be sustained he must make it good to his principal and if any profit accrues he must account for it.
In Smith vs Lascelles(1), it was held that if an agent was instructed to insure goods and neglected to do so he was liable to the principal for their value in the event of their being lost.
Section 212 of the Indian Con tract Act provides as follows : ""An agent is always bound to act with reasonable dili gence and use such skill as he possesses; to make compensa tion to his principal in respect of the direct consequences of is own neglect, want of skill or misconduct, but not in respect of loss or damage which are indirectly or remotely caused by such neglect, want of skill or misconduct.
"" These sections make it clear that in case of the agent 's negligence he is liable to make good the damage directly arising from his neglect but not indirectly or remotely caused by such neglect or misconduct.
The question there fore is whether in the present case the claim of the re spondents based on the neglect or misconduct can be stated to be a direct consequence of such neglect or misconduct or is only indirectly or remotely caused by such neglect.
Two positions can be visualized as arising from the appellants ' neglect in this case.
The appellants could be treated either as insurers themselves or can be considered as having agreed to cause the goods insured by a recognised insurance company on the usual fire insurance policy terms.
In Tickel vs Short(2), the Lord Chancellor shortly stated the proposition of law in these terms : "" The rule of equity is, that if an order (1) ; (2) 2 Ves.

989 is sent by a principal to a factor to make an insurance; and he charges his principal, as i[ it was made; if he never in fact has made that insurance, he is considered as the insur er himself"" If therefore, as in the present case, the appel lants were given instructions to insure the goods and they charged the respondents as if they had insured the goods, the law would throw upon them the liability of an insurer as if they stood in the position of insurers, i.e., the Court will then be entitled in equity to proceed on the footing as if an insurance had been effected by the appellants and the goods stood covered under a fire insurance policy.
Whatever consequences follow from that position must be accepted and enforced in a court of equity against the appellants.
Proceeding on that line of reasoning under section 14 of the Ordinance the only thing which is required to be considered is whether the goods were covered by a fire insurance policy.
The terms of the policy are immaterial.
If, therefore, the appellants are considered as having insured the goods and are precluded from saying that the goods were not covered by a fire insurance policy, the loss arising from the fact that the goods were not so covered is a direct consequence of their neglect and they must make it good.
That will make them liable to pay what was claimed by the respondents.
If, however, it is considered that they were not them selves insurers but that they had agreed only to keep the goods insured under a policy of insurance of a recognised insurance company on the usual fire insurance policy terms, the question is whether the damages claimed by the respond ents directly flow from their neglect of duty in not being able to produce such a fire insurance policy.
Our attention has been drawn to an instructive judgment which makes the distinction between direct and remote damages clear.
In In Re An Arbitration between Polemis & another and Furness Withy & Co. Ltd.(1) there is a discussion on this point in the judgment of Banks L.J.
He drew attention to the obser vations of Lord Sumner in Weld Blundell vs 990 Stephens (1), who observed as follows: ""What are natural, probable and necessary consequences ? Everything that hap pens, happens in the order of nature and is therefore natu ral.
Nothing that happens by the free choice of a thinking man is necessary except in the sense of pre destination.
To speak of probable consequences is to throw everything upon the jury.
It is tautologous to speak of effective cause or to say that damages too remote from the cause are irrecover able, for an effective cause is simply that which causes, and in law, what is ineffective or too remote is not a cause at all.
I still venture to think that direct cause is the best expression. . .
What a defendant ought to have anticipated as a reasonable man is material when the question is whether or not he was guilty of negligencee that is, of want of due care according to the circumstances; This however goes to capability, not to compensation.
"" Banks L.J., after noticing the above observations, stated as follows : "" Under these circumstances I consider that it is immaterial that the causing of the spark by the falling of the plank could not have been reasonably anticipated.
The appellants ' junior counsel sought to draw a distinction between the anticipation of the extent of damage resulting from a negligent act, and the anticipation of the type of damage resulting from such an act. .
I do not think that the distinction can be admitted.
Given the breach of duty which constitutes the negligence, and given the duty damage as a direct result of that negligence, the anticipations of the person whose negligent act has produced the damage appear to me to be irrelevant,"" The question of what is remoteness of damages in a case of negligence has been reviewed in detail in a recent deci sion of the House of Lords in Monarch Steamship Co. Ltd. vs Karlshamns Oljefabriker(2).
In that case the question arose in respect of damages due to the late delivery of goods shipped for a port in Sweden, but which ship, owing to its unseaworthiness, was delayed in its voyage and owing to the outbreak of war (1) (2) , 991 under orders of the British Admiralty, was directed not to proceed to the Swedish port but ordered to discharge the cargo at Glasgow.
The assignees of the bills of lading from the shippers had to forward the goods in neutral ships chartered for the purpose to the Swedish port.
A war risks clause in the charterparty exonerated the owners of the vessel in the event of compliance with any orders given by the government of the nation under whose flag the ship sailed, as to destination delivery or otherwise.
The hold ers of the bills of lading claimed the re transport charges from Glasgow to the Swedish port.
It was contended that these damages were too remote.
The House of Lords rejected the contention.
In the speech of Lord Wright most of the relevant authorities have been reviewed and the ratio decidendi has been set out.
In Hadley vs Baxendale (1) Alderson B., giving the judgment of the CoUrt, thought that the proper rule in such a case consisted of two alternatives.
He said: ""Where two parties have made a contract which one of them has broken the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered either arising naturally, i.e., according to the usual course of things, from such breach of contract itself, or such as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties at the time they made the contract, as the probable result of the breach of it."" In the opinion of Lord Wright this in truth gives effect to the broad general rule of the law of damages that a party injured by the other party 's breach of contract ""is entitled to such money compensation as will put him in the position in which he would have been but for the breach."" This rule was stated by Lord Blackburn in Livingstone vs Rawyards Coal Co. (2) as follows : ""Where any injury is to be compensated by damages, in settling the sum of money to be given for reparation of damages you should as nearly as possible get at that sum of money which will put the party who has been injured, (1) ; (2) , 39. 992 or who has suffered, in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained the wrong for which he is now getting his compensation or reparation.
"" The 'rule stated by Alderson B. has consistently been accepted as correct;the only difficulty has been in applying it.
The distinction drawn is between damages arising naturally (which means in the normal course of things) and cases where there were special and ex traordinary circumstances beyond the reasonable prevision of the parties.
The dis tinction between these types is usually described in English Law as that between generaland special damages; the latter are such that if they are not communicated it would not be fair or reasonable to hold the defendant responsible for losses which he could not be taken to contemplate as likely to result from his breach of contract.
Viscount Haldane L.C. in The British Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. Ltd. v, The Underground Electric Railways Co. of London (1), on the question of damages said :In some of the cases there are expressions as to the principles governing the measure of general damages which at first sight seem difficult to harmonize.
The apparent discrepancies are, however, mainly due to the varying nature of the particular questions submitted for decision.
The quantum of damage is a question of fact, and the only guidance the law can give is to lay down general principles which afford at times but scanty assistance.in dealing with particular cases.
The Judges who give guidance to juries in these cases have necessarily to look at their special character, and to mould, for the purposes of different kinds of claim, the expression of the general principles which apply to them and this is apt to give rise to an appearance of ambiguity. .It was necessary to balance loss and gain and no simple solution was possi ble.
"" The House of Lords in Liesbosch (Owners) vs Edison (Owners) (2) has stated at page 463 that it is impossible to lay down any universal formula.
The dominant rule of law is the principle of restitutio in integrum and subsidiary rules can only be justified if (1) 689.
(2) ; , 993 they give, effect to that rule.
(The italics are mine).
In Smith, Hogg & Co. Lid.
vs Black Sea & Baltic General Insurance Co. Ltd. (1), the loss of a vessel occurred through the negligence of the master operating on conditions of unseaworthiness existing since the com mencement of the voyage.
The loss was held to be caused by the breach of the warranty of seaworthiness and recoverable accordingly.
There was an exception of negligence.
At page 1005 in the judgment of that case it is stated ""no distinction could be drawn between cases where the negligent conduct of the master is a cause and cases where any other cause, such as perils of the sea, is a co operating cause.
A negligent act is as much a co operating cause if it is a cause at all.
, as an act which is not negligent.
"" What was then being emphasized was that a voluntary act (negligent or not) of a human agent is not generally an independent or new cause for this purpose which breaks the chain of causation, as it is called, so as to exclude from consideration the causal effect of the unsea worthiness.
In that case it was held that the unseaworthi ness created in the vessel instability which, combined with negligence of the master, caused the loss.
No new law was laid down in that case.
Similarly in The Standard Oil Co. o[ New York vs Clan Line Steamers Ltd. C""), the vessel capsized because the master not being instructed by his owners as to the peculiarities of a turret ship, so handled her that she capsized.
That loss was immediately due to perils of the sea which overwhelmed her when she capsized, liability for which was excepted, but the dominant cause was her unseaworthiness in that her master, though ' otherwise efficient, was inefficient in not being aware of the special danger.
In general, all the authorities are in agreement in this respect and embody the same rule.
TIm shipowner, of course, under the familiar general rule, is debarred by his breach of duty from relying on the specific exception.
Though he would not be liable for the conse quences caused by the specific excepted peril or the acci dent alone if he (1)[1940] A.G. 997.
(2) 994 were not in default, though the unseaworthiness existing at the commencement Of the voyage might not be operative or known until the time when the accident occurs, yet then the breach of the warranty operates directly as a cause and, indeed, a dominant cause.
Causation in law does not depend on remoteness or immediacy in time,"" These observations meet the appellants ' contention about the Government Ordinance intervening to fix the damages.
They show that such inter vention does not break the chain of causation, nor does it make the loss, i.e., damages, remote.
The statement of law in Mayne on Damages quoted above, only reproduces the prin ciple of law stated by Lord Blackburn in Livingstone vs Rawyards Coat Company(1).
Bearing in mind this state of the law itappears clear that in the present case it was the duty of the appellants to insure the goods, as they had agreed to do.
Once miscon duct is admitted or proved, the fact that the Ordinance did not exist and could not have been in the contemplation of the parties is irrelevant for deciding the question of liability.
The liability was incurred by reason of the breach of their duty and the appellants made themselves liable to pay damages.
The measure of damages was the loss suffered by the respondents on account of the goods not being insured.
The next point to be decided is what differ ence the promulgation of the Ordinance makes in the liabili ty of the appellants.
The relevant provisions are noted above.
The scheme of the Ordinance clearly is, as stated in the preamble, to provide for and regulate the payment of compensation and to prevent litigation, amongst other things.
It is thus a comprehensive legislation which re places the rights of parties either under the policy of insurance against insurance companies, or on the ground of negligence against Government by the owners of the goods, as also claims by insurance companies against Government.
The validity of this legislation is not challenged.
Section 18 gives it a retrospective effect.
Therefore the Ordinance only (1) 995 substitutes a new basis for assessing compensation for the ordinary basis for assessing unliquidated damages.
The compensation under the Ordinance is payable on proof of the existence of a fire insurance policy irrespective of the terms of the policy.
The non recovery of half the amount of the respondents ' claim from the Government under the Ordi nance because of the absence of a fire insurance policy, thus directly arises from the neglect of the appellants to insure the goods, as they had been instructed to do or agreed to do and which in fact they represented that they had done.
In our opinion, these are not indirect or remote damages.
The contention that under the policy of insurance the assured could not have recovered anything for loss caused by the fire due to explosion cannot be accepted.
Firstly, this contention of the assured 's inability to receive any compen sation because of clause 7 of the form of common policy was not raised in the trial court.
No issue was raised in re spect thereof and no arguments in support or against it were heard.
It was suggested for the first time, as appears from the judgment of Chagla J., in the court of appeal.
The assumption that because of clause 7 of the policy no insur ance company would have paid the loss cannot be assumed to be necessarily and unquestionably sound and in view of the terms of the Ordinance not capable of being determined.
There appears no reason under the circumstances to proceed as if an adverse decision on the interpretation of the policy had been given against the respondents and to hold the appellants free from liability for not recovering half the value of the goods which could have been recovered if the goods had been insured (irrespective of the terms on which the policy stood) as agreed to be done by them.
I do not think when the relations between the parties are of a principal and an agent and the agent is found to have com mitted a breach of his duty, it is correct to take a narrow view of the situation.
The agent chose to gamble in not insuring the goods and desired to charge the agreed premia, on the footing that the goods were covered by insurance.
If so, he must take the 996 consequences of his default.
The argument that their li ability as an agent who had agreed to insure should be ascertained as on the date of the explosion is no answer to the claim of the respondents.
The position would be this.
Assuming that the appellants had insured the goods on the terms of the usual fire insurance policy. the respondents could ask them either to assign the policy to the respond ents or to file a suit against the insurance company con tending that the fire, and not the explosion, was the; cause of the loss and was covered by the policy of insurance.
Before the Court could decide the rights of the parties, the Ordinance promulgated by the Governor General prevented the decision of the dispute, but the Government undertook to pay the loss on the footing that the policy covered the risk.
Tile misconduct gave rise to the liability to make good the damage and to put the respondents in the same position in which they would have been if their goods had beeen insured.
On behalf of the appellants it was urged that because of the Government intervention in issuing the Ordinance they were sought to be made liable under a new liability.
Their liability has been and exists on the basis that a fire insurance policy existed, as they were instructed to insure the goods and which they represented they had done.
The liability arises not because of the Ordinance but because of the breach of their duty in failing to insure, which has taken place apart from the Ordinance and which is not af fected by the Ordinance.
The utmost that they could urge is that the extent of their liability arising from their mis conduct was not anticipated by them when they agreed to perform their duty.
That however is no defence in law if the damages directly flow from the breach of duty.
The Ordinance only quantifies the damages instead of leaving the unliqui dated damages to be assessed in the usual way.
The Ordi nance lays down the yardstick for fixing the damages under different circumstances, which cover all alternative situa tions, and the liability for failure to insure must now be measured by the new basis.
It does not create any new li ability.
997 The appellants ' contention on this point therefore must be rejected.
The only other point urged before us was based on the construction of section 18 of the Ordinance.
It was argued on behalf of the appellants that apart from what could be recovered under clause (1) of section 18, the Ordinance extinguished all right, whether in contract or tort or otherwise, to any compensation or damage for loss of an), property du","The plaintiffs who were commission agents purchased piecegoods according to defendant 's instructions and stored a portion of the goods in a godown in Bombay pending receipt of a permit from the Government authorities for consigning the same to the defendants.
Before the goods could be despatched, a big explosion occurred in the Bombay Harbour and the goods stored were destroyed either by the fire or the explosion.
A few months later the Governor General promulgated the Bombay Explosion (Compensat,ion) Ordinance, 1944, which provided, inter alia, (i) that the Government shall pay a compensation of 50 per cent.
of the damage caused in respect of uninsured goods, and the entire damage in respect of insured goods; and (ii) that no person shall have or be deemed ever to have had, otherwise than under the Ordinannce any rights whether in contract or in tort or otherwise to any compensation for damage to or loss of property arising out of the explosion and no suit or other legal proceeding for any such compensation or damage shall be maintainable in any civil courts.
The plaintiffs re ceived 50 per cent of the value of the destroyed goods as they 980 were not insured, and, alleging that as agents they had the right to be indemnified by the defendants, sued the latter for recovery of the remaining 50 per cent of the value of the goods.
The defendants pleaded, and it was found as a fact, that they had instructed the plaintiffs, and the latter had agreed, to insure the goods but had omitted to do so, and they claimed that inasmuch as they would have been entitled to receive the full value of the goods as compensa tion under the Ordinance if the plaintiffs had insured, they were entitled to set off or counter claim the value of the goods as damages caused to them by the neglect or breach of duty of the plaintiffs.
Held per KANIA C.J. and DAS J. (PATANJALI SASRI J. dissenting). (i) As full compensation under the Ordinance was payable on proof of the existence of a fire insurance policy irrespective of the terms of the policy, and the non recovery of half the value of the goods from the Govern ment under the Ordinance was due to the obsence of a fire insurance policy, the loss to the defendants arose directly from the neglect or breach of duty of the plaintiffs to insure the goods as they had been instructed and agreed to do; intervention of the Ordinance did not break the chain of causation or make the loss remote or indirect; the Ordinance did not create any new liability but only quantified the damages; and the fact that it did not exist at the time of the explosion and could not have been in the contemplation of the parties was irrelevant for deciding the question of liability; (ii) the plea of the defendants was not barred by the Ordinnance inasmuch as their cause of action against the plaintiffs was misconduct of the latter in the business of their agency, and this cause of action was completed by the averment that there was a dnty or agreement to insure, that there was failure to per.
form that duty and that the fail ure had caused damage to the defendants, and the quantum of the damages was not a part of the cause of action.
Per PATANJALI SASRI J. (i) The defendants ' inability to recover the full value of the goods from the Government under the Ordinance did not arise directly and naturally in the usual course of things from the plaintiffs ' failure to insure, but from independent and disconnected events, name ly, the Government 's scheme for compensation, embodied in the Ordinance, the agreement with the insurance companies regarding contribution and the consequent discrimination made by the Government between insured and uninsured goods.
The Ordinance did not, displace the ordinary rules of law as to remoteness of damage or amend or abrogate any terms in the fire insurance policies and it was further difficult to see how by virtue of an Ordinance passed some months after the explosion, the right to damages could become enlarged.
The broad principle of restitutio in integrum upon which the assessment of the quantum of damages is based cannot be carried to its utmost logical results but must be qalified by the rule of remoteness 981 (ii) The bar under the Ordinance was not based upon the nature of the cause of action but upon the damage or loss being ""due to or in any way arising out of"" the explosion and the claim of the defendands was clearly barred.
In any event the defendants cannot be allowed to claim that the loss of the goods was explosion damage so as to bring the case under section 14 and at the same time contend that the loss was not due to or did not in any way arise out of the explo sion in order to avoid the bar under section 18.In re an Arbitration between Polemis and Another and Furness Withy & Co.

Appeal by special leave from an Award of the All India Industrial Tribunal (Bank Disputes) Bombay, dated 1st Janu ary, 1950.
The facts of the case are set out in the judg ment.
Dr. Bakshi Tek Chand (Veda Vyas and S.K. Kapur, with him) for the appellant.
B. Sen for the respondents.
Alladi Krishnaswami Aiyar (Jindra Lal, with him) for the Union of India. 1950.
May 26.
The Court delivered judgment as follows : KANIA C.J I have read the judgments prepared by Messrs. Fazl Ali, Mahajan and Mukherjea JJ.
461 in this case.
As the views in those judgments in respect of the nature of the duties and functions of the Industrial Tribunal do not show agreement I consider it necessary to add a few words of my own.
In my opinion, the functions and duties of the Indus trial Tribunal are very much like those of a body discharg ing judicial functions, although it is not a Court.
The rules framed by the Tribunal require evidence to be taken and witnesses to be examined, cross examined and re exam ined.
The Act constituting the Tribunal imposes penalties for incorrect statements made before the Tribunal.
While the powers of the Industrial Tribunal in some respects are different from those of an ordinary civil Court and it has jurisdiction and powers to give reliefs which a civil Court administering the law of the land (for instance, 'ordering the reinstatement of a workman) does not possess in the discharge of its duties it is essentially working as a judicial body.
The fact that its determination has to be followed by an order of the Government which makes the award binding, or that in cases where Government is a party the legislature is permitted to revise the decision, or that the Government is empowered to fix the period.
of the opera tion of the award do not, to my mind, alter the nature and character of the functions of the Tribunal.
Having consid ered all the provisions of the Act it seems to me clear that the Tribunal is discharging functions very near those of a Court, although it is not a Court in the technical sense of the word.
The next question is whether under article 136 the Court has jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to appeal against the decision of such a body.
It is not dis puted that the Court has power to issue writs of certiorari and prohibition in respect of the work of the Tribunal.
The only question is whether there is a right of appeal also.
In my opinion the wording of article 136 is wide enough to give jurisdiction to the Court to entertain an application for leave to appeal, although it is obvious that having regard to the nature of the functions of the Tribu nal, this Court will be very reluctant to entertain such an application.
462 As regards the merits, I do not think this is a case in which I would admit the appeal.
The aggrieved parties may apply for redress by adopting other appropriate proceedings.
The appeal therefore should be dismissed with costs.
FAZL ALl J.
The important question to be decided in this case is whether the present appeal lies at all to this Court.
The question is not free from difficulty, but on the whole I am inclined to think that 'the appeal does lie.
It is fully recognized that the scope article 136 of the Constitution is very wide, but the significance of the language used in the section can be appreciated only by comparing it with the articles which precede it.
Article 132 deals with the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in cases involving a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution, and the words used in that article are: ""appeal. from any judgment, decree or finalorder."" Article 133 deals with appeals in civil matters and the same words are used here also.
Arti cle 134 deals with appeals in criminal matters, and the words used in it are: ""appeal. from any judgment, final order or sentence."" In article 136, the words ""judg ment"" and ""decree,"" which are used in articles 132 and 133 are retained.
Similarly, the words ""judgment"" and ""sen tence"" occurring in article 134 are also retained.
But the expression ""final order"" becomes ""order,"" and, instead of the High Court, reference is made to ""any court.
"" Cer tain other words are also used in the article which seem to me to have a special significance, these being ""determina tion,"" ""cause or matter"" and ""tribunal.
"" It is obvious that these words greatly widen the scope of article 136.
They show that an appeal will lie also from a determination or order of ""any tribunal"" in any cause or matter.
Can we then say that an Industrial Tribunal does not fall within the scope of article 136 ? If we go by a mere label, the answer must be in the affirmative.
But we have to look further and see what are the main functions of the Tribunal and how it proceeds to discharge those functions.
This is necessary because 463 I take it to be implied that before an appeal can.
lie to this Court from a tribunal it must perform some kind of judicial function and partake to some extent of the charac ter of a Court.
Now there can be no doubt that the Industrial Tribunal has, to use a well known expression, ""all the trappings of a Court"" and performs functions which cannot but be regarded as judicial.
This is evident from the rules by which the proceedings before the Tribunal are regulated.
It appears that the proceeding before it commences on an application which in many respects is in the nature of a plaint.
It has the same powers as are vested in a civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure when trying a suit, in respect of discovery, inspection, granting adjournment, reception of evidence taken on affidavit, enforcing the attendance witnesses, compelling the production of documents, issuing commissions, etc.
It is to be deemed to be a civil Court within the meaning of sections 480 and 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898.
It may admit and call for evidence at any stage of the proceeding and has the power to administer oaths.
The parties appearing before it have the right of examination, cross examination and re examination and of addressing it after all evidence has been called.
A party may also be represented by a. legal practitioner with its permission.
The matter does not rest there.
The main function of this Tribunal is to adjudicate on industrial disputes which implies that there must be two or more parties before it with conflicting cases, and that it has also to arrive at a conclusion as to how the dispute is to be ended.
Prima facie, therefore, a Tribunal like this cannot be excluded from the scope of article 136, but before any final conclu sion can be expressed on the subject certain contentions which have been put forward on behalf of the respondents have to be disposed of.
The first contention is that the Industrial Tribunal cannot be said to perform a judicial or quasi judicial function.
since it is not required to be guided by any recognized substantive law in deciding disputes 464 which come before it.
On the other hand, in deciding industrial disputes, it has to override contracts and create rights which are opposed to contractual rights.
In these circumstances, it is said that the very questions which arose before the Privy Council in Moses vs
Parker Ex parte Mose (1) arise in this case, these questions being : (1) How can the propriety of the Tribunal 's decision be tested on appeal, and (2) What are the canons by which the appellate Court is to be guided in deciding the appeal ? Their Lordships of the Privy Council undoubtedly felt that these were serious questions, but they had no hesitation in saying that ""if it were clear that appeals ought to be allowed.
such difficulties would doubtless be met somehow.
"" This, in my opinion, is a sufficient answer to the difficul ty raised.
The Tribunal has to adjudicate in accordance with the provisions of the .
It may sometimes override contracts, but so can a Court which has to administer law according to the Bengal or Bihar Money lenders Act, Encumbered Estates Act and other similar Acts.
The Tribunal has to observe the provisions of the special law which it has to administer though that law may be dif ferent from the law which an ordinary Court of justice administers.
The appellate Court, therefore, can at least see that the rules according to which it has to act and the provisions which are binding upon it are observed, and its powers are not.exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner.
The second contention, which is a more serious one, is that the adjudication of the Tribunal has not all the at tributes of a judicial decision, because the adjudication cannot bind the parties until it is declared to be binding by the Government under section 15 of the Industrial Dis putes Act.
It is said that the adjudication is really in the nature of an advice or report which is not effective until made so by the Government.
It appears that a similar objection was raised in Rex vs Electricity Commissioner 's, London Electricily ' (1) Joint Committee Co. (1920) Ex Parte (1) for the purpose of deciding whether a writ of certiorari should be Issued in the circumstances of the case but was dis.
posed of in these words : ""It is necessary, however, to deal with what i think was the main objection of the Attorney General.
In this case he said the Commissioners come to no decision at all.
They act merely as advisers.
They recommend an order embodying a scheme to the Minister of Transport, who may confirm it with or without nodifications.
Similarly the Minister of Trans port comes to no decision.
He submits the order to the Houses of Parliament, who may approve it with or without modifications.
The Houses of Parliament may put anything into the order they please, whether consistent with the Act of 1919, or not.
Until they have approved, nothing is decided, and in truth the whole procedure, draft scheme, inquiry, order, confirmation, approval, is only part of a process by which Parliament is expressing its will, and at no stage is subject to any control by the Courts.
It is unnecessary to emphasize the constitutional importance of this contention. .
In the provision that the final decision of the Commissioners is not to be operative until it has been approved by the two Houses of Parliament I find nothing inconsistent with the view that in arriving at that decision the Commissioners themselves are to act judicially and within the limits prescribed by Act of Parliament, and that the Courts have power to keep them within those limits.
It is to be noted that it is the order of the Commissioners that eventually takes effect; neither the Minister of Trans port who confirms, nor the Houses of Parliament who approve, can under the statute make an order which in respect.
of the matters in question has any operation.
I know of no author ity which compels me to hold that a proceeding cannot be a judicial proceeding subject to prohibition or certiorari because it is subject to confirmation or approval, even where the approval has to be that of the Houses of Parlia ment.
The authorities are to the contrary. ' ' (1) 466 It is well known that a writ of certiorari can issue only against an order of a judicial or quasi judicial tribu nal and if it is permissible for the High Court to.
issue a writ of certiorari against an Industrial Tribunal, which fact was not seriously disputed before us, I find it diffi cult to hold that the tribunal does not come with in the purview of article 136.
If a subordinate Court acts in excess of its jurisdiction or assumes a jurisdiction which it does not possess, the appellate Court can always interfere and do what is contemplated to be done by a writ of certiorari.
It is to be noted that under section 15 of the , in cases where the appropriate Govern ment is not a party to the dispute, all that the Government has to do on receiving the award of the Tribunal is to declare it to be binding and to state from what date and for what period it will be binding.
Section 15.(2) is mandatory and it provides: ""On receipt of such award, the appropriate Government shall by order in writing declare the award to be binding. . "" Thus the Government cannot alter, or cancel, or add to the award, but the award must be declared to be binding as it is.
In substance, therefore, the adjudication of the Tribunal amounts to a final determination of the dispute which binds the parties as well as the Government.
Our attention was however drawn to the proviso to section 15 (2), which runs as follows: ""Provided that where the appropriate Government is a. party to the dispute and in its opinion it would be inexpe dient on public grounds to give effect to the whole or any part of the award, it shall on the first available opportu nity lay the award together with the statement of its rea sons for not making a declaration as aforesaid before the Legislative Assembly of the Province, or where the appropri ate Government is the Central Government, before the Central Legislative Assembly, and shall, as soon as may be, cause to be moved therein a resolution for the consideration of the 467 award, and the Legislative Assembly may, by its resolution, confirm, modify, or reject the award.
"" This proviso was relied upon by the respondents to show that the right to appeal from the award could not have been contemplated in any case.
But the Act itself makes a dis tinction between cases in which the Government is a party and those in which the Government is not a party.
The proviso relates to a very special type of case and as at present advised I do not wish to express any opinion as to whether an appeal lies to this Court or not in such a case, but, in my judgment, where the Government has only to de clare the award to be binding, an appeal shall lie.
It is necessary here to say a few words as to the scope of the appeal.
As was pointed out by this Court in Pritam Singh vs The State(1), the power under article 136 of the Constitution being a special power is to be exercised only in special cases.
The rule so laid down is bound to re strict the scope of the appeal in practice in almost all the cases which fall under article 136.
But in some cases a limitation will be imposed on the scope of the appeal by the very nature of the case and of the tribunal from which an appeal is sought to be brought, and a case under the Indus trial Disputes Act seems to be an example of such a case.
Dealing now with the merits of the appeal, I am not prepared to hold that this is a proper case for interference with the adjudication of the Tribunal.
The power of this Court was invoked by the appellants on four grounds.
These grounds have been elaborately examined by Mahajan J. and two of them have been pronounced to be wholly inadequate for justifying our interference.
My view with regard to these two grounds is identical with that of Mahajan J. and I do not wish to add to what he has already said on the subject.
The remaining two grounds also are, in my opinion, wholly insufficient to justify the exercise of our special power under article 136.
One of these grounds is that the award of the Tribunal is based on no evidence whatsoever.
I do not, however, find that this ground (1) ; 60 468 was urged in this form in the application for special leave to appeal to this Court.
All that was intended to be urged was that the appellants wanted to adduce evidence but were not allowed to do so.
From the decision of the Tribunal however, it appears that the evidence that was shut out related to one isolated point only and the Tribunal might well have been justified in not allowing evidence to be admitted on a point which in its opinion had no direct bearing on the issue before them.
After hearing the re spondents on this particular point, I am not disposed to hold that the Tribunal has committed such an error as would justify the interference of this Court.
The last ground urged is that the award has been signed by only two members of the Tribunal though it originally consisted of three persons and though the entire hearing of the dispute had taken place before all the three persons.
This objection does not appear to me to be fatal to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, because under section 8 of the Act it is not obligatory on the Government to appoint a new member to fill a vacancy if one of the members ceases to be available at any time during the proceedings.
Under that section, if the Chairman ceases to be available, the Govern ment must appoint his successor, whereas if a member ceases to be available the Government may or may not appoint any one to fill his place.
In the present case, our attention was drawn to some correspondence which shows that one of the members was called upon to act as a member of another Tribu nal and the award in question was pronounced after informing the Government of the procedure which the Chairman and the remaining members intended to adopt.
In the view I have taken, this appeal must fail, and I would accordingly dismiss it with costs.
MAHAJAN J. This is an appeal by special leave from the determination of an industrial dispute by the Industrial Tribunal appointed under Ordinance VI of 1949.
Bharat Bank Limited, Delhi, the appellant, is a company registered under the Indian Companies Act.
469 Its employees made certain demands and as a result of an unfavourable response from the bank it appears that they struck work on the 9th March, 1949.
The bank in its turn served notices on them to resume work and proceeded to discharge a number of them between the 19th March and 24th March as they failed to do so.
The Central Government constitued a Tribunal consisting of three persons for the adjudication of industrial disputes in banking companies under section 7 of the (XIV of 1947), The disputes mentioned in schedule II of the notifi cation were referred under section 10 of the Act to this Tribunal.
Item 18 of this schedule reads as follows : ""Retrenchment and victimization (Specific cases to be cited by employees).
"" The dispute under this item between the Bharat Bank and its employees was heard by the Tribunal at Delhi and its award was made on the 19th January, 1950.
It was published in the Government of India Gazette dated 4th February, 1950, and was declared to be binding for a period of one year.
The award of the Tribunal was signed by two out of its three members.
A preliminary objection was raised on behalf of the Central Government as well as on behalf of the respondents that this Court had no jurisdiction to grant special leave to appeal against the determination of an Industrial Tribu nal inasmuch as it did not exercise the judicial powers of the State and that its determination was not in the nature of a judgment, decree or order of a Court so as to be ap pealable.
This being the first case in which special leave was granted from the determination of an Industrial Tribu nal, it is necessary to examine the provisions of the Con stitution dealing with this matter and if possible, to define the limits of the jurisdiction of this Court under article 136.
This article is in these terms : ""(1) Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter, the Supreme Court may, in its discretion, grant special leave to appeal from any judgment, decree, determination, sentence or order m any cause or matter passed 470 or made by any court or tribunal in the territory of India.
(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall apply to any judgment, determination, sentence or order passed or made by any court or tribunal constituted by or under any law relating to the Armed Forces.
"" The article occurs in Chapter IV of Part V of the Consti tution: ""The Union Judiciary.
"" Article deals with the establishment and constitution of the Supreme Court.
Article 131 confers original jurisdiction on this Court in certain disputes arising between the Government of India and the States etc.
Articles and 133 deal with the appellate juris diction of the Court in appeals from High Courts within the territory of India in civil matters.
By article 134 limited right of appeal in criminal cases has been allowed.
The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which was the high est Court of appeal for India prior to 10th October, 1949, was not a Court of criminal appeal in the sense in which this Court has been made a Court of criminal appeal under article 134.
It could only entertain appeals on the crimi nal side in exercise of the prerogative of the King.
Article 135 empowers this Court to hear all appeals which under existing laws could be heard by the Federal Court of India.
By the Abolition of Privy Council Jurisdiction Act, 1949,which came into force on the 10th October, 1949, all the powers that were possessed by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in regard to cases or matters arising in India became exercisable by the Federal Court of India whether those powers were exercisable by reason of statutory authority or under the prerogative of the King.
The powers of the Judicial Committee were conferred upon it by the Judicial Committee Act, 1844 (7 & 8 Vict., C. 69).
Appeals lay to His Majesty in Council from judgments, sentences, decreesor orders of any Court of justice within any British colony or possession abroad.
Closely following article 135 which confers all the powers of the Judicial Committee on the Supreme Court comes article 136.
The language employed in this article is very wide and is of a comprehensive character.
Powers given 471 are of an overriding nature.
The article commences with the words ""Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter.
"" These words indicate that the intention of the Constitution was to disregard in extraordinary cases the limitations contained in the previous articles on this Court 's power to entertain appeals.
These articles dealt with the right of appeal against final decisions of High Courts within the territory of India.
Article 136, however, overrides that qualification and empowers this Court to grant special leave even in cases where the judgment has not been given by a High Court but has been given by any Court in the territory of India; in other words, it contemplates grant of special leave in cases where a Court subordinate to a High Court has passed or made any order and the situation demands that the order should be quashed or reversed even without having recourse to the usual procedure provided by law in the nature of an appeal, etc.
The word ""order"" in article 136 has not been qualified by the word ""final.
"" It is clear, therefore, that the power to grant special leave under this article against an order of a Court could be exercised with respect to interlocutory orders also.
Another new feature introduced in article 136 is the power given to grant special leave against orders, and determinations etc.
of any tribunal in the territory of India.
This word did not find place in the Judicial Committee Act, where the phrase used was ""a Court of jus tice.
"" It is the introduction of this new expression in article 136 that has led to considerable argument as to its scope.
Another expression that did not find place in the Judicial Committee Act but has been introduced in article 136 is the word ""determination."" A question has been raised as to the meaning to be given to these words in the article.
On the one hand, it was contended that the words ""determina tion"" and ""tribunal"" were introduced in the article in order to bring within the scope of the applellate jurisdiction of this Court all orders of tribunals of different varieties and descriptions.
On the other hand, it was said that the words ""determination"" and ""tribunal"" were added in the article by way of abundant caution and 472 the intention was that if a tribunal exercised the judicial powers of the State and the decision was passed in the exercise of that power, this Court as the highest judicial Court in the Republic would have power, if it considered, necessary in the ends of justice, to grant special leave.
Clause (2) of article 136 excludes the jurisdiction of this Court in respect of military Courts.
or Tribunal.
It is interesting to observe that in articles 138, 139 and 140 the Constitution has conferred powers on Parliament for further enlargement of the powers of this Court.
Two points arise for determination in this case: (1) whether the word ""tribunal"" in this article has been used in the same sense as ""Court,"" or whether it has been used in a wider sense, and (2) whether the word ""determination"" in the article includes within its scope the determinations made by Industrial Tribunals or other similarly constituted bodies or whether it has reference only to determinations of a Court or a tribunal of a purely judicial character.
It was conceded by the learned counsel appearing for the Cen tral Government, Mr. Alladi Krishnaswami Aiyar, that if any tribunal, whether administrative, domestic or quasi judi cial, acts in excess of its jurisdiction, then it can be controlled by the High Courts under the powers conferred on them by article 226 by the issue of a writ of certiorari.
It was said that if the Industrial Tribunal in this case could be proved to have trespassed beyond the limits 0 its statutory jurisdiction, then the remedy lies elsewhere and not by a petition of special leave under article 136.
Mr. Alladi 's contentions may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) The expression ""tribunal "" means seat of a judge, or a court of justice.
Its necessary attribute is that it can give a final judgment between two parties which carries legal sanction by its own force.
That the word ""tribunal"" in juxtaposition to the word ""court"" could only mean a tribunal 'which exercised judicial functions of the State and did not include within its ambit a tribunal which had quasi judicial or administrative powers.
(2) The kinds of orders against which special leave to appeal could be given under article 136 473 have to be of the same nature as passed by a Court , ' in other words, it was said that unless there was a judicial determination of a controversy between two parties, the order would not be appealable.
That in the case of an Industrial Tribunal what gives binding force to the award is the declaration of the government, that the spark of life to it is given by that declaration and without that, the award of the Tribunal is lifeless and has no enforceability and hence cannot be held to be of an appealable nature.
It was further said that in cases between the Government and its employees, by the procedure prescribed in the Act the award could also be rejected, and that being so, by its own deter mination a tribunal could not impose a liability or affect rights.
Dr. Bakshi Tek Chand, appearing for the bank, on the other hand argued that whenever a tribunal, whether exercis ing judicial or quasi judicial functions, determined a matter in a judicial manner, then such a determination is within article 136.
It was said that an Industrial Tribunal has no administrative or executive functions, that its duty is to adjudicate on an industrial dispute, i.e., to act as a Judge, on certain kinds of disputes between employers and employees and that its functions are of a judicial nature, though the ambit of the powers conferred is larger than that of an ordinary Court of law inasmuch as it can grant reliefs which no Court of law could give, but that is because of the powers conferred on it by law.
It was argued that the plain words of the article should not be given a narrow meaning when the intention of the Constitution was to confer the widest power on this Court.
It was further contended that as between private employers and employees and even in certain cases between Government and its employees the decision of the Tribunal was binding on the Government and Government had no power either to affirm, modify or reject it.
All that it was authorised to do was to announce it and by its declaration give it enforceability; that fact, howev er, could not affect the question of appealability of the determination under article 136.
It was finally argued that powers should be exercised by this Court wherever there is a miscarriage 474 of justice by a determination of any tribunal and that if the intention of the Constitution by use of the word ""tribunal""was in the same sense as ""court,"" then it was not necessary to import it in article 136, because all tribunals that exercise judicial functions fall within the definition of the word ""court"" though they may not have been so de scribed.
After considerable thought I have reached the conclusion that the preliminary objection should be overruled.
I see no cogent reasons to limit the plain words of the statute and to place a narrow interpretation on words of widest ampli tude used therein.
In construing the articles of the Con stitution it has always to be remembered that India has been constituted into a sovereign democratic republic in order to ensure justice to all its citizens.
In other words, the foundations of this republic have been laid on the bedrock of justice.
To safeguard these foundations so that they may not be undermined by injustice occurring anywhere this Court has been constituted.
By article S2 of the Constitu tion the Court is empowered to see that the fundamental rights conferred on the citizens by the Constitution are not in any way affected.
By article 136 it has been given overriding power to grant special leave to appeal against orders of courts and tribunals which go against the princi ple of natural justice and lead to grave miscarriage of justice.
The exercise of these, powers could only have been contemplated in cases which affect the rights of people living within the territory of India in respect of their person, property or status.
The question, therefore, for consideration is whether the jurisdiction conferred by use of unambiguous phraseology and by words which have a plain grammatical meaning and are of the widest amplitudeshould be limited and restricted on considerations suggested by Mr. Alladi.
The construction suggested by the learned counsel, if accepted, would in the first instance make the use of certain words in the article unnecessary and redundant and would run counter to the spirit of the Constitution.
It must be presumed that the draftsmen of the Constitution knew well the fact that there were a number of tribunals consti tuted in this country 475 previous to the coming into force of the Constitution which were performing certain administrative, quasi judicial or domestic functions, that some of them had even the trap pings of a Court but in spite of those trappings could not be given that description.
It must also be presumed that the Constitution makers were aware of the fact that the highest Courts in this country had held that all tribunals that discharged judicial functions fell within the definition of the expression ""Court.
"" If by the use of the word ""tribu nal"" in article 136 the intention was to give it the same meaning as ""Court,"" then it was redundant and unnecessary to import it in the article because, by whatever name de scribed, such a tribunal would fall within the definition of the word ""Court.
"" The word ""Court"" has a well known meaning in legislative history and practice.
As pointed out in Halsbury 's Laws of England, the word ""Court"" originally meant the King 's Palace but subsequently acquired the meaning of (1) a place where justice was admin istered, and (2) the person or persons who administer it.
In the Indian Evidence Act it is defined as including all judges and magistrates and all persons except arbitrators legally authorized to take evidence.
This definition is by no means exhaustive and has been framed only for the pur poses of the Act.
There can be no doubt that to be a Court, the person or persons who constitute it must be entrusted with judicial functions, that is, of deciding litigated questions according to law.
However, by agreement between parties arbitrators may be called upon to exercise judicial powers and to decide a dispute according to law but that would not make the arbitrators a Court.
It appears to me that before a person or persons can be said to constitute a Court it must be held that they derive their powers from the State and are exercising the judicial powers of the State.

The functions and duties of the Industrial Tribunal constituted under , are very much like those of a body discharging judicial functions although it is not a Court, and under article 136 of the Constitution of India the Supreme Court jurisdiction to entertain an application for leave to appeal from decision of the Tribunal, even though it will be very to entertain such an application.
Per MUKERJEA J. (PATANJALI SASTRI J. concurring).
An Industrial Tribunal functioning under the is not a judicial tribunal.
The nature of the determinations made and the materials and considerations on which it has to decide a dispute are also such that the powers of an appellate court cannot be exer cised fully and effectively in respect of them and such determinations are therefore outside the purview of article 136 of the Constitution.
Even assuming that the Court had jurisdiction appeal, the present case was not a fit one for entertaining an appeal from the determination of the Tribunal.

Appeal from an order of the High Court of Patna dated 9th September, 1948, (Agarwala C.J. and Meredith J.) in M.J.C. No. 5 of 1948.

The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAzL ALl J.
800 FAZL ALI J.
This is an appeal from an order of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dated the 9th September, 1948, declining to call upon the board of Revenue to state a case under section 21 (3) of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1944 (Act VI of 1944), with reference to an assessment made under that Act.
The Bihar Sales Tax Act was passed in 1944, and section 4 of the Act provides that ""every dealer whose gross turn over during the year immediately preceding the commencement of the Act exceeded Rs. 5,000 shall be liable to pay tax under the Act on sales effected after the date so notified.
"" It is not disputed that, having regard to the definitions of dealer, goods and sale under the Act, the appellant, who has been doing contract work on a fairly extensive scale for the Central Public Works Department and the East Indian Railway, comes within the category of a dealer mentioned in section 4.
Section 7 of the Act provides that ""no dealer shall, while being liable under section 4 to pay tax under the Act, carry on business as a dealer unless he has been registered under the Act and possesses a registration certificate"".
In pursuance of this provision, the appellant filed an applica tion for registration on the 19th December, 1944, and a certificate of registration was issued to him on the 21st December, 1944.
On the 8th October, 1945, the Sales Tax Officer issued a notice to the appellant asking him to produce his accounts on 10th November, 1945, and to show cause why in addition to the tax to be finally assessed on him a penalty not exceeding one and a half times the amount should not be imposed on him under section 10 (5) of the Act.
Section 10 (5), under which the notice purported to have been issued, runs thus: ""If upon information which has come into his posses sion, the Commissioner is satisfied that any dealer has been liable to pay tax under this Act in respect of any period and has nevertheless wilfully failed to apply for registra tion, the Commissioner shall, alter giving the dealer a reasonable opportunity of being heard, assess, to the best of his judgment, the amount of tax, if any, due from the dealer in respect of such 801 period and all subsequent periods and the Commissioner may direct that the dealer shall pay, 'by way of, penalty, in addition to the amount so assessed, a sum not exceeding one and a half times that amount.
"" The appellant appeared before the Sales Tax Officer in response to this notice, but obtained several adjournments till 16th March, 1046, and ultimately failed to appear.
Thereupon, he was assessed by the Sales Tax Officer, accord ing to the best of his judgment, and was ordered to pay Rs. 4,526 13 0 as tax and a penalty amounting to one and a half times the amount assessed, under section 10 (5) of the Act.
The appellant appealed to the Commissioner against the assessment and the penalty levied upon him, but his appeal was dismissed on the 6th June, 1946.
He then filed a peti tion for revision to the Board of Revenue, against the order of the Commissioner, but it was dismissed on the 28th May, 1947.
He thereupon moved the Board of Revenue to refer to the High Court certain questions of law arising out of is order of the 28th May, but Mr. N. Baksi, a Member of the Board, by his order of the 4th December, 1947, rejected the petition with the following observations : ""No case for review of my predecessor 's order made out.
No reference necessary.
"" Section 21 of the Act provides that if the Board of Revenue refuses to make a reference to the High Court, the applicant may apply to the High Court against such refusal, and the High Court, if it is not satisfied that such refusal was justified, may require the Board of Revenue to state a case and refer it to the High Court.
The section also provides that ""the High Court upon the hearing of any such case shall decide the question of law raised thereby, and shall deliver its judgment thereon containing the grounds on which such decision is founded, and shall send to the Board of Revenue a copy of such judg ment under the seal of the Court . . and the Board shall dispose of the case accordingly.
"" In accordance with this section, the appellant made an application to the High Court praying that the Board of Revenue may be called upon to state a case and refer 802 it to the High Court.
Dealing with this application, the High Court pointed out that the Member of the Board had not been asked to review his predecessor 's order but only to state a case, and gave the following directions : ""The ease must, therefore, go back to the Board of Revenue for a case to be stated or for a proper ,order rejecting the application to be passed."" The Board then reheard the matter and rejected the application of the appellant and refused to state a case and refer it to the High Court.
The appellant thereafter made an application to the High Court for requiring the Board of Revenue to state a case, but this application was summarily rejected.
He then applied to the High Court for leave to appeal to the Federal Court, which the High Court granted, following the decision of a Full Bench of the Lahore High Court in Feroze Shah Kaka Khd vs Income tax Commissioner, punjab and N.W.F.P., Lahore The High Court pointed out in the order granting leave that in the appeal that was taken to the Privy Council in the Lahore case, an objection had been raised as to the competency of the appeal, but the Privy Council, while dismissing the appeal on the merits, had made the following observation: "" The objection is a serious one.
Admittedly such an appeal as the present is not authorized by the Income tax Act itself.
If open at all, it must be justified under clause ""9, Letters Patent of the Lahore High Court, as being an appeal from a final judgment, decree or order made in the exercise of original jurisdiction by a Division Bench of the High Court.
And this present appeal was held by the Full Court to be so justified.
Before the Board the question was not fully argued, and their Lordships accordingly refrain from expressing any opinion whatever upon it"" (2).
The High Court in granting leave to the appellant seems to have been influenced mainly by the fact that the view of the Lahore High Court had not been held by the Privy Council to be wrong.
(1) A.I.R. 1981 Lah.
(2) A.I.R. 1933 P. C. 198.
803 At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal in this Court, a preliminary objection was raised by the learned counsel for the respondent that this appeals was not compe tent, and, on hearing both the parties, we are of the opin ion that the objection is wellfounded.
In Sri Mahanth Harihar Gir vs Commissioner of Income tax, Bihar and Orissa (1) it was held by a special Bench of the Patna High Court that no appeal lay to His Majesty in Council under clause 31 of the Letters Patent of the Patna High Court, from an order of the High Court dismissing an application under section 66 (3) of the Income tax Act, (a provision similar to section 21 of the Act before us) to direct the Commissioner of Income tax to state a case.
In that case, the whole law on the subject has been clearly and exhaustively dealt with, and it has been pointed out that the view taken by the Full Bench of the Lahore High Court in the case cited by the appellant was not supported by sever al other High Courts and that the Privy Council also, when the matter came before it, refrained from expressing any opinion as to its correctness.
In our opinion, the view expressed in the Patna case is correct.
Clause 31 of the Letters Patent of the Patna High Court, on the strength of which the appellant resists the prelimi nary objection raised by the respondent, runs thus : ""And We do further ordain that any person or persons may appeal to Us, Our heirs and successors, in Our or Their Privy Council, in any matter not being of criminal juris diction, from any final judgment, decree, or order of the said High Court of Judicature at Patna, made on appeal and from any final judgment, decree on order made in the exercise of original jurisdiction by Judges of the said High Court or of any Division Court, from which an appeal does not lie to the said High Court under the provisions contained in the 10th clause of these (1) A.I.R. 1941 Prat.
804 presents: provided, in either case, that the sum or matter at issue is of the amount or value of not less than ten thousand rupees, or that such judgment,decree or order involves, directly or indirectly, some claim, demand or question to or respecting property amounting to or of the value of not less than ten thousand rupees; or from any other final judgment, aecree or order made either on appeal or otherwise as aforesaid, when the said High Court declares that the case is a fit one for appeal to Us . "" In order to attract the provisions of this clause, it is necessary to show, firstly, that the order under appeal is a final order; and secondly, that it was passed in the exer cise of the original or appellate jurisdiction of the High Court.
The second requirement clearly follows from the concluding part of the clause.
It seems to us that the order appealed against in this case, cannot be regarded as a final order, because it does not of its own force bind or affect the rights of the parties.
All that the High Court is required to do under section 21 of the Bihar Sales Tax Act is to decide the question of law raised and send a copy of its judgment to the Board of Revenue.
The Board of Revenue then has to dispose of the case in the light of the judgment of the High Court.
It is true that the Board 's order is based on what is stated by the High Court to be the correct legal position, but the fact remains that the order of the High Court standing by itself does not affect the rights of the parties, and the final order in the matter is the order which is passed ultimately by the Board of Revenue.
This question has been fully dealt with in Tata Iron and Steel Company vs Chief Revenue Authority, Bombay(1), where Lord Atkinson pointed out that the order made by the High Court was merely advisory and quoted the following observations of Lord Esher in In re Knight and the Tabernacle Permanent Building Society(2): ""In the case of Ex parte County Council of Kent, where a statute provided that a case might be stated (1) at 617. 805 for the decision of the Court it was held that though the language might prima facie import that there has to be the equivalent of a judgment or order, yet when the context was looked at it appeared that the jurisdiction of the Court appealed to was only consultative, and that there was noth ing which amounted to a judgment or order.
"" It cannot also be held that the order was passed by the High Court in this case in the exercise of either original or appellate jurisdiction.
It is not contended that the matter arose in the exercise of the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court, because there was no appeal before it.
Nor can the matter, properly speaking, be said to have arisen in the exercise of the original jurisdiction of the High Court, as was held by the Judges of the Lahore High Court in the case to which reference was made, because the proceeding did not commence in the High Court as all origi nal suits and proceedings should commence.
But the High Court acquired jurisdiction to deal with the case by virtue of an express provision of the Bihar Sales Tax Act.
The crux of the matter therefore is that the jurisdiction of the High Court was only consultative and was neither original nor appellate.
In this view, the appeal must be dismissed, though on hearing the parties, it appeared to us that the salestax authorities including the Commissioner and the Board of Revenue were in error in imposing a penalty upon the appel lant under section 10 15) of the Act which had no applica tion to his case, inasmuch as he had been registered as required by section 7 of the Act.
In the circumstances, while dismissing the appeal, we make no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.
Agent for the respondent:
K. Chatterjee.
","No appeal lay to the Federal Court from an order of the Patna High Court dismissing an application under section 21(3)of the Bihar Sales Tax Act, 1944, to direct the Board of Reve nue, Bihar, to state a case and refer it to the High Court.
Such an order is not a` ""final order"" within the meaning of cl. 31 of the Letters Patent of the Patna High Court, inas much as an order of the High Court under section '21 (3) is advisory and standing by itself does not bind or affect the rights of the parties though the ultimate order passed by the Board of Revenue may be based on the opinion expressed by the High Court.
Nor is such an order passed by the High Court in the exercise either of its appellate or original jurisdiction within the meaning of the said clause.

"" The only point argued before us relates to the consti tutional validity of section 7 (1) (c) of the impugned Act which, as appears from its preamble, was passed ""to provide special measures to ensure public safety 608 and maintenance of public order.
"" Section 7 (1) (c) under which the aforesaid order purports to have been made reads (so far as material here) as follows : ""The Provincial Government or any authority authorised by it in this behalf if satisfied that such action is neces sary for the purpose of preventing or combating any activity prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order may, by order in writing addressed to a print er, publisher or editor require that any matter relating to a particular subject or class of subjects shall before publication be submitted for scrutiny."" The petitioners claim that this provision infringes the fundamental right to the freedom of speech and expression conferred upon them by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitu tion inasmuch as it authorises the imposition of a restric tion on the publication of the journal which is not justi fied under clause (2) of that article.
There can be little doubt that the imposition of precen sorship on a journal is a restriction on the liberty of the press which is an essential part of the right to freedom of speech and expression declared by article 19 (1)(a).
As pointed out by Blackstone in his Commentaries ""the liberty of the press consists in laying no previous restraint upon publications, and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published.
Every freeman has an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public; to forbid this, is to destroy the freedom of the press(1).
The only question therefore is whether section 7 (1)(c) which authorises the imposition of such a restriction falls within the reservation of clause (2) of article 19.
As this question turns on considerations which are essentially the same as those on which our decision in Petition No. XVI of 1950(2) was based, our judgment in that case concludes the present case also.
Accordingly, for the reasons indicated in that judgment, we allow this petition and hereby quash the impugned order of the Chief Commission er, Delhi, dated the 2nd March, 1950.

The question raised in this case relates to the validity of 'section 7 (1) (c) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949 (as extended to the Province of Delhi), which runs as follows : ""The Provincial Government or any authority authorised by it in this behalf if satisfied that such action is neces sary for the purpose of preventing or combating any activity prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order, may, by order in writing addressed to a print er, publisher or editor * * * * (c) require that any matter relating to a particular subject or class of subjects shall before publication be submitted for scrutiny;"" It should be noted that the provisions of sub clause (c) arc not in general terms but are confined to a ""particular subject or class of subjects,"" and that having regard to the context in which these words are used, they must be connect ed with ""public safety or the maintenance of public order.
"" The petitioners, on whose behalf this provision is assailed, are respectively the printer (and publisher) and editor of an English weekly of Delhi called Organizer, and they pray for the issue of writs of certiorari and prohibi tion to the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, with a view ' 'to examine and review the legality"" of and ""restrain the operation"" of and ""quash"" the order made by him on the 2nd March, 1950, under the impugned section, directing them ""to submit for scrutiny, in duplicate, before publication, till further orders, all communal matter and news and views about Pakistan including photographs and cartoons other than those derived from official sources or supplied by the news agencies. "" The order in question recites among other things that the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the Organizer has been publishing highly objectionable matter constituting a threat to public law and order and that action to which reference has been made is necessary for the purpose of preventing or combating activities 610 prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order.
It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that notwithstanding these recitals the order complained against is liable to be quashed, because it amounts to an infringement of the right of freedom of speech and expres sion guaranteed by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution.
Articles 19 (1) (a) and (2), which are to be read together, run as follows : 19, (1) All citizens shall have the right (a) to freedom of speech and expression; * * * * (2) Nothing in sub clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to, or prevent the State from making any law relating to, libel, slander, defamation, contempt of Court or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which under mines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State.
"" It is contended that section 7 (1)(c) of the Act, under which the impugned order has been made, cannot be saved by clause (2) of article 19 of the Constitution, because it does not relate to any matter which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State.
Thus the main ground of attack is that the impugned law is an infringement of a fundamental right and is not saved by the so called saving clause to which reference has been made.
There can be no doubt that to impose pre censorship on a journal, such as has been ordered by the Chief Commissioner in this case, is a restriction on the liberty of the press which is included in the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitu tion, and the only question which we have therefore to decide is whether clause (2) of article 19 stands in the way of the petitioners.
The East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, of which sec tion 7 is a part, was passed by the Provincial Legislature in exercise of the power conferred upon it by section 100 of the Government of India Act, 1935, is 611 read with Entry 1 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to that Act, which includes among other matters ""public order."" This expression in the general sense may be construed to have reference to the maintenance of what is generally known as law and order in the Province, and this is confirmed by the words which follow it in Entry 1 of List II and which have been put within brackets, viz., ""but not including the use of naval, military or air forces or any other armed forces of the Union in aid of the civil power.
"" It is clear that anything which affects public tranquillity within the State or the Province will also affect public order and the State Legislature is therefore competent to frame laws on matters relating to public tranquillity and public order.
It was not disputed that under the Government of India Act, 1935 (under, which the impugned Act was passed) it was the responsibility of each Province to deal with all internal disorders whatever their magnitude may be and to preserve public tranquillity and order within the Province.
At this stage, it will be convenient to consider the meaning of another expression ""public safety"" which is used throughout the impugned Act and which is also chosen by its framers for its title.
This expression, though it has been variously used in different contexts (see the Indian Penal Code, Ch.
XIV), has now acquired a well recognized meaning in relation to an Act like the impugned Act, as a result of a long course of legislative practice, and may be taken to denote safety or security of the State.
In this sense, it was used in the Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Act, 1914, as well as the Defence of India Act.
and this is how it was judicially interpreted in Rex vs Governor of Wormwood Scrubbs Prison(1).
The headnote of this case runs as follows ""By section 1 of the Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Act, 1914, power was given to His Majesty in Council 'during the continuance of the present war to issue regula tions . for securing the public safety and the de fence of the realm ' : (1) 612 Held, that the regulations thereby authorized were not limited to regulations for the protection of the country against foreign enemies, but included regulations designed for the prevention of internal disorder and rebellion "" Thus 'public order ' and 'public safety ' are allied matters, but, in order to appreciate how they stand in relation to each other, it seems best to direct our atten tion to the opposite concepts which we may, for convenience of reference, respectively label as 'public disorder ' and 'public unsafety '.
If 'public safety ' is, as we have seen, equivalent to 'security of the State ', what I have designat ed as public unsafety may be regarded as equivalent to 'insecurity of the State '.
When we approach the matter in this way, we find that while 'public disorder ' iS wide enough to cover a small riot or an affray and other cases where peace is disturbed by, or affects, a small group of persons, 'public unsafety ' (or insecurity of the State), will usually be connected with serious internal disorders and such disturbances of public tranquillity as jeopardize the security of the State.
In order to understand the scope of the Act, it will be necessary to note that in the Act ""maintenance of public order"" always occurs in juxtaposition with ""public safety"", and the Act itself is called ""The East Punjab Public Safety Act.
"" The prominence thus given to 'public safety ' strongly suggests that the Act was intended to deal with serious cases of public disorder which affect public safety or the security of the State, or cases in which, owing to some kind of emergency or a grave situation having arisen, even public disorders of comparatively small dimensions may have far reaching effects on the security of the State.
It is to be noted that the Act purports to provide ""special measures to ensure public safety and maintenance of public order.
"" The words ""special measures"" are rather important, because they show that the Act was not intended for ordinary cases or ordinary situations.
The ordinary cases are provided for by the Penal Code and other existing laws, and 613 with these the Act which purports to be of a temporary Act is not apparently concerned.
It is concerned with special measures which would presumably be required for special cases or special situations.
Once this important fact is grasped and the Act is viewed in the proper perspective, much of the confusion which has been created in the course of the arguments will disappear.
The line of argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners is that since the Act has been passed in exercise of the power granted by the expression ""public order,"" used in the Government of India Act, which is a general term of wide import, and since it purports to provide for the maintenance of public order, its provisions are intended or are liable to be used for all cases of breaches of public order, be they small or insig nificant breaches or those of a grave or serious nature.
This is, in my opinion, approaching the case from a wrong angle.
The Act is a piece of special legislation providing for special measures and the central idea dominating it is public safety and maintenance of public order in a situation requiring special measures.
It was argued that ""public safety"" and ""maintenance of public order"" are used in the Act disjunctively and they are separated by the word ""or"" and not ""and,"" and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility of the Act providing for ordinary as well as serious cases of disturbance of public order and tranquillity.
This, as I have already indicated, is a somewhat narrow and technical approach to the question.
In construing the Act, we must try to get at its aim and purpose, and before the Act is declared to be invalid, we must see whether it is capable of being so construed as to bear a reasonable meaning consistent with its validity.
We therefore cannot ignore the fact that preservation of public safety is the dominant purpose of the Act and that it is a special Act providing for special measures and therefore it should not be confused with an Act which is applicable to ordinary situations and to any and every trivial case of breach of public order, 614 In my opinion, the word ""or"" is used here not so much to separate two wholly different concepts as to show that they are closely allied concepts and can be used almost inter changeably in the context.
I think that ""public order"" may well be paraphrased in the context as public tranquillity and the words ""public safety"" and ""public order"" may be read as equivalent to ""security of the State"" and ""public tran quillity.
"" I will now advert once more to clause (2) of article 19 and state what I consider to be the reason for inserting in it the words ""matter which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State.
"" It is well recognized in all systems of law that the right to freedom of speech and expression or freedom of the press means that any person may write or say what he pleases so long as he does not infringe the law relating to libel or slander or to blasphemous, obscene or seditious words or writings: (see Halsbury 's Laws of England, 2nd Edition, Vol.
II, page 391).
This is prac tically what has been said in clause (2) of article 19, with this difference only that instead of using the words ""law relating to sedition,"" the framers of the Constitution have used the words mentioned above.
It is interesting to note that sedition was mentioned in the original draft of the Constitution, but subsequently that word was dropped and the words which I have quoted were inserted.
I think it is not difficult to discover the reason for this change and I shall briefly state in my own words what I consider it to be.
The latest pronouncement by the highest Indian tribunal as to the law of sedition is to be found in Niharendu Dutt Majumdar vs The King(1) which has been quoted again and again and in which Gwyer C.J. laid down that public disor der, or the reasonable anticipation or likelihood of public disorder, is the gist of the offence of sedition and ""the acts or words complained of must either incite to disorder or (1) 615 must be such as to satisfy reasonable men that is their intention or tendency.
"" For this view, the learned Chief Justice relied on certain observations of Fitzgerald J. in R.v.
Sullivan (1), and he also added that he was content to adopt ""the words of that learned Judge which are to be found in every book dealing with this branch of the criminal law.
"" There is no doubt that what Gwyer C.J. has stated in that case represents the view of a number of Judges and authors and was also the view of Sir James Stephen in regard to whom Cave J. in his charge to the jury in a case relating to the law of sedition JR.
vs Burns(2) said : ""The law upon the question of what is seditious and what is not is to be found stated very clearly in a book by Stephen J. who has undoubtedly a greater knowledge of crimi nal law than any other Judge who sits upon the Bench, and what he has said upon the subject of sedition was submitted to the other Judges, who sometime back were engaged with him in drafting a criminal code, and upon their report the Commissioners say that his statement of law appears to them to be stated accurately as it exists at present.
"" The decision of Gwyer C.J. held the field for several years until the Privy Council, dealing with a case under the Defence of India Rules, expressed the view in King Emper or vs Sadhashiv Narayan Bhalerao(3) that the test laid down by the learned Chief Justice was not applicable in India where the offence under section 124A of the Indian Penal Code should be construed with reference to the words used in that section.
They also added : ""The word 'sedition ' does not occur either in section 124A or in the Rule; it is only found as a marginal note to section 124A, and is not an operative part of the section, but merely provides the name by which the crime defined in the section will be known.
(1) [1868] 11 Cox c.c. 44.
(2) [1886] 16 cox 855.
(8) 74 I.A. 616 There can be no justification for restricting the contents of the section by the marginal note.
In England there is no statutory definition of sedition; its meaning and content have been laid down in many decisions, some of which are referred to by the Chief Justice, but these decisions are not relevant when you have a statutory definition of that which is termed sedition as we have in the present case.
Their Lordships are unable to find anything in the language of either section 124A or the Rule which could suggest that 'the acts or words complained of must either incite to disorder or must be such as to satisfy reasonable men that this is their intention or tendency.
"" The framers of the Constitution must have therefore found themselves face to face with the dilemma as to whether the word ""sedition"" should be used in article 19 (2) and if it was to be used in what sense it was to be used.
On the one hand, they must have had before their mind the very widely accepted view supported by numerous authorities that sedition was essentially an offence against public tranquil lity and was connected in some way or other with public disorder; and, on the other hand, there was the pronounce ment of the Judicial Committee that sedition as defined in the Indian Penal Code did not necessarily imply any inten tion or tendency to incite disorder.
In these circumstances, it is not surprising that they decided not to use the word ""sedition"" in clause (2) but used the more general words which cover sedition and everything else which makes sedi tion such a serious offence.
That sedition does undermine the security of the State is a matter which cannot admit of much doubt.
That it undermines the security of the State usually through the medium of public disorder is also a matter on which eminent Judges and jurists are agreed.
Therefore it is difficult to hold that public disorder or disturbance of public tranquillity are not matters which undermine the security of the State.
617 It will not be out of place to quote here the following passage from Stephen 's Criminal Law of England (Vol. II, pp. 242 and 243) : ""It often happens, however, that the public peace is disturbed by offences which without tending to the subver sion of the existing political constitution practically subvert the authority of the Government over a greater or less local area for a longer or shorter time.
The Bristol riots in 1832 and the Gordon riots in 1780 are instances of this kind.
No definite line can be drawn between insur rections of this sort, ordinary riots, and unlawful assem blies.
The difference between a meeting stormy enough to cause well founded fear of a breach of the peace, and a civil war the result of which may determine the course of a nation 's history for centuries, is a difference of degree.
Unlawful assemblies, riots, insurrections, rebellions, levying of war, are offences which run into each other, and are not capable of being marked off by perfectly definite boundaries, All of them have in common one feature, namely, that the normal tranquillity of a civilised society is in each of the cases mentioned disturbed either by actual force or at least by the show and threat of it.
Another class of offences against public tranquillity are those in which no actual force is either employed or displayed, but in which steps are taken tending to cause it.
These are the formation of secret societies, seditious conspiracies, libels or words spoken.
Under these two heads all offences against the internal public tranquillity of the State may be arranged.
"" This passage brings out two matters with remarkable clarity.
It shows firstly that sedition is essentially an offence against public tranquillity and secondly that broadly speaking there are two classes of offences against public tranquillity: (a) those accompanied by violence including disorders which 618 affect tranquillity of a considerable number of persons or an extensive local area, and (b) those not accompanied by violence but tending to cause it, such as seditious utter ances, seditious conspiracies, etc.
Both these classes of offences are such as will undermine the security of the State or tend to overthrow it if left unchecked, and, as I have tried to point out, there is a good deal of authorita tive opinion in favour of the view that the gravity ascribed to sedition is due to the fact that it tends to seriously affect the tranquillity and security of the State.
In principle, then, it would not have been logical to refer to sedition in clause (2) of article 19 and omit matters which are no less grave and which have equal potentiality for undermining the security of the State.
It appears that the framers of the Constitution preferred to adopt the logical course and have used the more general and basic words which are apt to cover sedition as well as other matters which are as detrimental to the security of the State as sedition.
If the Act is to be viewed as I have suggested, it is difficult to hold that section 7 (1) (c) falls outside the ambit of article 19 (2).
That clause clearly states that nothing in clause (1) (a) shall affect the operation of any existing law relating to any matter which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State.
I have tried to show that public disorders and disturbance of public tranquillity do undermine the security of the State and if the Act is a law aimed at preventing such disorders, it fulfils the requirement of the Constitution.
It is needless to add that the word ""State"" has been defined in article 12 of the Constitution to include ""the Government and Parlia ment of India and the Government and Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.
"" I find that section 20 of the impugned Act provides that the Provincial Government may by notification 619 declare that the whole or any part of the Province as may be specified in the notification is a dangerously disturbed area.
This provision has some bearing on the aim and object of the Act, and we cannot overlook it when considering its scope.
It may be incidentally mentioned that we have been informed that, under this section, Delhi Province has been notified to be a ""dangerously disturbed area.
"" It must be recognized that freedom of speech and expres sion is one of the most valuable rights guaranteed to a citizen by the Constitution and should be jealously guard ed by the Courts.
It must also be recognised that free political discussion is essential for the proper functioning of a democratic government, and the tendency of modern jurists is to deprecate censorship though they all agree that ""liberty of the press"" is not to be confused with its ""licentiousness.
"" But the Constitution itself has pre scribed certain limits for the exercise of the freedom of speech and expression and this Court is only called upon to see whether a particular case comes within those limits.
In my opinion, the law which is impugned is fully saved by article 19 (2) and if it cannot be successfully assailed it is not possible to grant the remedy which the petitioners are seeking here.
As has been stated already, the order which is impugned in this case recites that the weekly Organizer has been publishing highly objectionable matter constituting a threat to public law and order"" and that the action which it is proposed to take against the petitioners ""is necessary for the purpose of preventing or combating activities prejudi cial to public safety or the maintenance of public order.
"" These facts are supported by an affidavit sworn by the Home Secretary to the Chief Commissioner, who also states among other things that the order in question was passed by the Chief Commissioner in consultation with the Central Press Advisory Committee, which is an independent body elected by the All India Newspaper Editors ' Conference and is composed of 620 representatives of some of the leading papers such as The Hindustan Times, Statesman, etc.
In my opinion, there can be no doubt that the Chief Commissioner has purported to act in this case within the sphere within which he is permitted to act under the law, and it is beyond the power of this Court to grant the reliefs claimed by the petitioners.
In these circumstances, I would dismiss the petitioners ' application.

Per FAZL ALI J.
The expression ""public safety"" has, as a result of a long course of legislative practice acquired a well recognised meaning and may be taken to denote safety or security of the State; and, though the expression ""public order"" is wide enough to cover small disturbances of the peace which do not jeopardise the security of the State yet, prominence given in the Act to public safety, the fact that the Act is a piece of special legislation providing for special measures and the aim and scope of the Act in gener al, show that preservation of public safety is the dominant purpose of the Act, and ""public order"" may well be para phrased in the context as ""public tranquillity"".
Public disorders which disturb the public tranquillity do undermine the security of the State and as section 7 (1) (c) of the im pugned Act is aimed at preventing such disorders it is difficult to hold that it falls outside the ambit of article 19 (2) of the Constitution.

20.txt,"No. LIX of 1949.
Appeal from the judgment of the Allahabad High Court (Verma and Yorke JJ.) dated 6th September, 1943 in First Appeal No. 3 of 1940.
P.L. Banerjee (B. Banerjee, with him), for the appel lant.
768 S.P. Sinha (N.C. Sen, with him), for the respondents.
November 14.
The court delivered judgment as follows : MUKHERJEA J.
This appeal is directed against an appel late judgment of a Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court dated September 6, 1943, by which the learned Judges reversed a decision of the Civil Judge, Etawah, made in Original Suit No. 28 of 1936.
The suit was one commenced by the plaintiff, who is respondent No. 1 in this appeal, for recovery of possession of two items of immovable property one, a residential house and other, a shop both of which are situated in the town of Etawah.
The properties admittedly formed part of the estate of one Mangal Sen who died sometime towards the end of the last century, leaving behind him, as his heirs, his two widows, Mst.
Mithani and Mst.
Mangal Sen had a son named Chhedi Lal and a daughter named Janki Kuar born of his wife Mst.
Rani, but both of them died during his lifetime.
Chhedi Lal had no issue and he was survived by his widow Mst.
Meria,while Janki left a son named Thakur Prasad.
Janki 's husband married another wife and by her got a son named Babu Ram.
On Mangal Sen 's death, his properties devolved upon his two widows, and Mst.
Rani having died subsequently, Mst.
Mithani came to hold the entire estate of her husband in the restricted rights of a Hindu widow.
On 27th November 1919, Mst.
Mithani surrendered the whole estate of her husband by a deed of gift in favour of Thakur Prasad who was the nearest reversioner at that time.
Thakur Prasad died in 1921, leaving a minor son named Nand Lal who succeeded to his properties and this Nand Lal is the plain tiff in the suit out of which this appeal arises.
On 27th October 1921, there was a transaction entered into between Babu Ram on his own behalf as well as guardian of infant Nand Lal on the One hand and Mst.
Meria, the widow of Chhedi Lal, on 769 the other, by which two items of property which are the subject matter of the present litigation were conveyed to Meria by a deed of transfer which has been described as a Tamliknama; and she on her part executed a deed of relin quishment renouncing her claims to every portion of the estate left by Mangal Sen.
It is not disputed that Meria took possession of the properties on the basis of the Tam liknama and on 10th April 1923 she executed a will, by which these properties were bequeathed to her three nephews, who are the sons of her brother Sunder Lal.
Meria died on 19th June 1924.
One Ram Dayal had obtained a money decree against Sunder Lal and his three sons, and in execution of that decree the properties in suit were attached and put up to sale and they were purchased by Ram Dayal himself on 30th January 1934.
On 1st June 1936, the present suit was insti tuted by Nand Lal and he prayed for recovery of possession of these two items of property on the allegation that as they were given to Mst.
Meria for her maintenance and resi dence, she could enjoy the same only so long as she lived and after her death, they reverted to the plaintiff.
Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, was made the first defendant in the suit, and his three sons figured as defendants Nos.
2 to 4.
Defendant No. 5 is a lady named Chimman Kunwar in whose favour Sunder Lal was alleged to have executed a deed of transfer in respect of a portion of the disputed proper ty.
Ram Dayal, the decree holder auction purchaser, died in May 1935 and his properties vested in his daughter 's son Ram Gopal under a deed of gift executed by him in favour of the latter.
On 1st September 1938, Ram Gopal was added as a party defendant to the suit on the plaintiff 's application and he is defendant No. 6.
The two other defendants, namely, defendants 7 and 8, who were also made parties at the same time, are respectively the widow and an alleged adopted son of Ram Dayal.
The suit was contested primarily by defendant No. 6, and the substantial contentions raised by him in his written statement were of a two fold character.
770 The first and the main contention was that Mst.
Meria got an absolute title to the disputed properties on the strength of the 'Tamliknama ' executed in her favour by the guardian of the plaintiff and after her death, the properties passed on to the three sons of Sunder Lal who were the legatees under her will.
Ram Dayal, it was said, having purchased these properties execution of a money decree against Sunder Lal and his three sons acquired a valid title to them.
The other contention raised was that the suit was barred by limitation.
The trial Judge decided both these points in favour of the contesting defendant and dismissed the plain tiff 's suit.
On appeal to the High Court, the judgment of the Civil Judge was set aside and the plaintiff 's suit was decreed.
The defendant No. 6 has now come up on appeal to this court and Mr. Peary Lal Banerjee, who appeared in support of the appeal, pressed before us both the points upon which the decision of the High Court has been adverse to his client.
The first point raised by Mr. Banerjee turns upon the construction to be placed upon the document executed by Babu Ram on his own behalf as well as on behalf of Nand Lal then an infant, by which the properties in dispute were trans ferred to Mst.
Meria by way of a 'Tamliknama '.
The question is whether the transferee got, under it, an absolute inter est in the properties, which was heritable and alien able or was it the interest of a life tenant merely.
The documentis by no means a complicated one.
It begins by a recital of the events under which Nand Lal became the sole owner of the properties left by Mangal Sen and refers in this connection to the obligation on the part of both Babu Ram and Nand Lal to ""support, maintain and console"" Mst.
Meria, the widow of the pre deceased son of Mangal Sen.
The document then proceeds to state as follows: ""I have therefore, of my own accord and free will without any compulsion or coercion on the part of any one else while in my proper senses made a Tamlik of a double storied pucca built shop . and a house 771 and a kothri in Etawah . . worth Rs. 8,000 for purposes of residence of the Musammat, owned by the minor aforesaid . which at present stands let out on rent to Sunder Lal, brother of Mst.
Meria aforesaid . . in favour of Mst.
Meria aforesaid, widow of Chhedi Lal and made her the owner (Malik).
If any portion or the whole of the property made a Tamlik of for the purpose mentioned above passes out of the possession of the Musammat aforesaid on account of the claim of Nand Lal minor aforesaid, I and my property of every sort shall be responsible and liable for the same.
"" This document has got to be read along with the deed of relinquishment, which is a contemporaneous document execut ed by Meria renouncing all her claims to the property left by Mangal Sen.
The deed of relinquishment like the Tamliknama recites elaborately, with reference to previous events, particularly to the deed of gift executed by Mst.
Mithani in favour of Thakur Prasad, the gradual devolution of the entire estate of Mangal Sen upon Nand Lal.
It states thereafter that Babu Ram, as the guardian of the minor and also in his own right, ""has under a Tamliknama dated this day made a 'Tamlik '.
in my favour of a shop alongwith a Balakhana and a kota for my maintenance and a house . . for purpose of my residence which are quite sufficient for my maintenance."" ""I have therefore, of my own accord "", the document goes on to say, ""made a relinquishment of the entire property aforesaid mentioned in the deed of gift . worth Rs. 25,000.
I do covenant and do give in writing that I have and shall have no claim to or concern with the property . . belonging to the minor afore said, nor has the property aforesaid remained subject to my maintenance allowance nor shall I bring any claim at any time.
"" The schedule to the instrument, it may be noted, gives a list of all the properties of Mangal Sen in respect to which Mst.
Mithani executed a deed of gift in favour of Thakur Prasad, including the two items of property covered by the 'Tamliknama ' mentioned aforesaid.
772 In construing a document whether in English or in vernacular the fundamental rule is to ascertain the inten tion from the words used; the surrounding circumstances are to be considered, but that is only for the purpose of finding out the intended meaning of the words which have actually been employed(1).
In the present case the instru ment of grant has been described as a 'Tamliknama ' which means a document by which ' Maliki ' or ownership rights are transferred and the document expressly says that the grantee has been made a ' Malik ' or owner.
There are no express words making the gift heritable and transferable; nor on the other hand, is there any statement that the transferee would enjoy the properties only during her life time and that they would revert to the grantor after her death.
It may be taken to be quite settled that there is no warrant for the proposition of law that when a grant of an immovable property is made to a Hindu female, she does not get an absolute or alienable interest in such property, unless such power is expressly conferred upon her.
The reasoning adopted by Mr. Justice Mitter of the Calcutta High Court in Kollani Koer vs Luchmee Parsad(2) which was ap proved of and accepted by the Judicial Committee in a number of decisions, seems to me to be unassailable.
It was held by the Privy Council as early as in the case of Tagore vs Tagore( '3) that if an estate were given to a man without express words of inheritance, it would, in the absence of a conflicting context, carry, by Hindu Law, an estate of inheritance.
This is the general principle of law which is recognised and embodied in section 8 of the Transfer of Property Act and unless it is shown that under Hindu Law a gift to a female means a limited gift or carries with it the restrictions or disabilities similar to those that exist in a 'widow 's estate ', there is no justification for departing from this principle.
There is certainly no such provision in Hindu Law and no text could be supplied in support of the same.

773 The position, therefore, is that to convey an absolute estate to a Hindu female, no express power of alienation need be given; it is enough if words are used of such ampli tude as would convey full rights of ownership.
Mr. Banerjee naturally lays stress upon the description of the document as 'Tamliknama ' and the use of the word ' Malik ' or owner in reference to the interest which it pur ports to convey to the transferee.
The word ' Malik ' is of very common use in many parts of India and it cannot cer tainly be regarded as a technical term of conveyancing.
In the language of the Privy Council, the term 'Malik ' when used in a will or other document ""as descriptive of the position which a devisee or donee is intended to hold, has been held apt to describe an owner possessed of full pro prietory rights, including a full right of alienation, unless there is something in the context or in the surround ing circumstances to indicate that such full proprietory rights were not intended to be conferred(1). ' ' This I think to be a perfectly correct statement of law and I only desire to add that it should be taken with the caution which the Judicial Committee uttered in course of the same observa tion that ""the meaning of every word in an Indian document must always depend upon the setting in which it is placed, the subject to which it is related and the locality of the grantor from which it receives its true shade of meaning.
"" The question before us, therefore, narrows down to this as to whether in the present case there is anything in the context of these two connected instruments or in the sur rounding circumstances to cut down the full proprietory rights that the word 'Malik ' ordinarily imports.
The High Court in reaching its decision adverse to the appellant laid great stress on the fact that the grant was expressed to be for maintenance and residence of Mst.
Meria.
This, it is said, would prima facie indicate that the grant was to enure for the lifetime of the grantee.
It is pointed out by the learned (1) Vide Sasiman Chowdhurain vs Shib Narayan, 49 I.A, 25.
99 774 Judges that the language of the document does not show that anybody else besides the lady herself was to be benefited by the grant and the indemnity given by Babu Ram was also given to the lady personally.
It is further said that if Meria was given an absolute estate in the properties comprised in the 'Tamliknama ', there was no necessity for including these two properties again in the deed of relinquishment which she executed at the same time.
I do not think that the mere fact that the gift of property is made for the support and maintenance of a female relation could be taken to be a prima facie indication of the intention of the donor, that the donee was to enjoy the property only during her life time.
The extent of interest, which the donee is to take, depends upon the intention of the donor as expressed by the language use, d, and if the dispositive words employed in the document are clear and unambiguous and import absolute ownership, the purpose of the grant would not, by itself, restrict or cut down the interest.
The desire to provide maintenance or residence of the donee would only show the motive which prompted the donor to make the gift, but it could not be read as a meas ure of the extent of the gift.
This was laid down in clear terms by the Judicial Committee in a comparatively recent case which is to be found reported in Bishunath Prasad vs Chandrika(1).
There a Hindu executed a registered deed of gift of certain properties in favour of his daughter in law for the"" support and maintenance"" of his daughter in law and declared that the donee should remain absolute owner of the property (malik mustaqil) and pay Government revenue.
There were no words in the document expressly making the interest heritable or conferring on the donee the power of making alienation.
It was held by the Judicial Committee that the donee took under the document, an absolute estate with powers to make alienation giving title valid after her death.
In course of the judgment, Lord Blanesburgh quoted, with approval, an earlier decision of the (1) 60 I.A 56 775 Judicial Committee, where the words ""for your maintenance"" occurring in a deed of gift were held insufficient to cut down to life interest the estate taken by the donees.
These words, it was said, ""are quite capable of signifying that the gift was made for the purpose of enabling them to live in comfort and do not necessarily mean that it was to be limited to a bare right of maintenance.
"" On behalf of the respondent, reliance was placed upon the decision of the Judicial Committee in Raja Ram Buksh vs Arjun(1)in support of the contention that in a maintenance grant it is the prima facie intention of the gift that it should be for life.
In my opinion, the decision cited is no authority for the general proposition as is contended for by the learned Counsel for the respondent, and it is to be read in the context of the actual facts of the case which relate to grants of a particular type with special features of its own.
It was a case where a Talukdar made a grant of certain villages to a junior member of the joint family for mainte nance of the latter.
The family was governed by the law of primegeniture and the estate descended to a single heir.
In such cases the usual custom is that the junior members of the family, who can get no share in the property, are enti tled to provisions by way of maintenance for which assign ments of lands are generally made in their favour.
The extent of interest taken by the grantee in the assigned lands depends entirely upon the circumstances of the partic ular case, or rather upon the usage that prevails in the particular family.
In the case before the Privy Council there was actually no deed of transfer.
It was an oral assignment made by the Talukdar, and the nature of the grant had to be determined upon the recitals of a petition for mutation of names made to the Revenue Department by the grantor after the verbal assignment was made and from other facts and circumstances of the case.
The case of Woodoya ditta Deb vs Mukoond(2), which was referred to and relied upon in the judgment of the Privy Council, was (1) 28 I.A, 1.
(2) 22 w.
R. 229.
776 also a case of maintenance or khor phos grant made in favour of a junior member of the family, where theestate was im partible and descended under the rules of primogeniture.
It was held in that case that such grants, the object of which was to make suitable provisions for the immediate members of the family, were by their very nature and also under the custom of the land resumable by the zemindar on the death of the grantee, as otherwise the whole zemindary would be swallowed up by continual demands.
This principle bas obviously no application to cases of the type which we have before us and it was never so applied by the Privy Council, as would appear from the decision referred to above.
The learned Counsel for the plaintiff respondent drew our attention in this connection, to the fact that the properties given by the ,Tamliknama ' were valued at Rs. 8,000, whereas the entire estate left by Mangal Sen was worth Rs. 25,000 only.
It is argued that the transfer of nearly one third of the entire estate in absolute right to one who was entitled to maintenance merely, is, on the face of it, against probability and common sense.
I do not think that, on the facts of this case, any weight could be at tached to this argument.
In the first place, it is to be noted that whatever might have been the actual market value of the properties, what the widow got under the Tamliknama was a residential house and a shop, and the shop was the only property which fetched any income.
This shop, it appears, was all along in possession of Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, and the rent, which he paid or promised to pay in respect of the same, was only Rs. 12 a month.
So from the income of this property it was hardly possible for Meria to have even abate maintenance, and this would rather support the inference that the properties were given to her absolutely and not for enjoyment merely, so long as she lived.
But what is more important is, that the object of creating these two documents, as the surrounding circumstances show, was not merely to make provision 777 for the maintenance of Mst.
Meria; the other and the more important object was to perfect the title of Nand Lal to the estate left by Mangal Sen and to quiet all disputes that freight arise in respect of the same.
It may be that Mst.
Meria could not, in law, claim any.
thing more than a right to be maintained out of the estate of her deceased father in law.
But it is clear that whatever her legal rights might have been, Nand Lal 's own position as the sole owner of the properties left by Mangal Sen was not altogeth er undisputed or free from any hostile attack.
As has been said already, Sunder Lal, the brother of Meria, was in occupation of the double storied shop from long before the Tamliknama was executed and Meria got any legal title to it.
It appears from the record that in 1920 a suit was institut ed on behalf of the infant Nand Lal for evicting Sunder Lal from the shop and the allegation in the plaint was that Sunder Lal was occupying the property as a tenant since the time of Mst.
Mithani by taking a settlement from her.
Sunder Lal in his written statement filed in that suit expressly repudiated the allegation of tenancy and also the title of Nand Lal and openly asserted that it was Mst.
Meria who was the actual owner of Mangal Sen 's estate.
The suit ended in a compromise arrived at through the medium of arbitrators and the result was that although Sunder Lal admitted the title of the plaintiff, the latter had to abandon the claims which were made in the plaint for rents, costs and damages.
Sunder Lal continued to be in occupation of the shop and executed a rent agreement in respect of the same in favour of Nand Lal promising to pay a rent of Rs. 12 per month.
A few months later, the Tamliknama was executed and this shop along with the residential house were given to Meria in maliki right.
The recitals in both the Tamliknama and the deed of relin quishment clearly indicate that the supreme anxiety on the part of Babu Ram, who was trying his best to safeguard the interests of the minor, was to put an end to all further disputes that might be raised by or on behalf of Mst.
Meria with regard to the rights of Nand Lal to the properties 778 of Mangal Sen and to make his title to the same absolutely impeccable.
That seems to be the reason why Meria was given a comparatively large portion of the properties left by Mangal Sen which would enable her to live in comfort and her interest was not limited to a bare right of mainte nance.
It is significant to note that the shop room, which was all along in possession of Sunder Lal, was included in this Tamliknama and soon after the grant was made, Sunder Lal executed a rent agreement in respect of the shop in favour of Mst.
Meria acknowledging her to be the owner of the property.
It is true that the document does not make any reference to the heirs of Meria, but that is not at all necessary, nor is it essential that any express power of alienation should be given.
The word ""Malik"" is too common an expres sion in this part of the country and its meaning and impli cations were fairly well settled by judicial pronouncements long before the document was executed.
If really the grantee was intended to have only a life interest in the properties, there was no lack of appropriate words, per fectly well known in the locality, to express such inten tion.
The High Court seems to have been influenced to some extent by the fact that in the Tamliknama there was a guarantee given by Babu Ram to Meria herself and to no one else agreeing to compensate her in case she was dispossessed from the properties at the instance of Nand Lal.
This covenant in the document was in the nature of a personal guarantee given by Babu Ram to Mst.
Meria for the simple reason that the property belonged to an infant and it was as guardian of the minor that Babu Ram was purporting to act.
It was too much to expect that Babu Ram would bind himself for all time to come and give a guarantee to the future heirs of Meria as well.
Probably no such thing was contem plated by the parties and no such undertaking was insisted upon by the other side.
But whatever the reason might be which led to the covenant being expressed in this particu lar form, I do not think that it has even a remote bearing on the 779 question that arises for our consideration in the present case.
It is of no assistance to the plaintiff in support of the construction that is sought to be put upon the , docu ment on his behalf.
I am also not at all impressed by the other fact re ferred to in the judgment of the High Court that if the properties were given to Meria in absolute right, there was no necessity for including them again in the schedule to the deed of relinquishment which Meria executed.
I fail to see how the inclusion of the properties in the deed of relin quishment would go to indicate that Meria 's rights to these properties were of a restricted and not an absolute charac ter.
It is after all a pure matter of conveyancing and the two documents have to be read together as parts of one and the same ' transaction.
Under the ' Tamliknama ', Meria got two properties in absolute right out of the estate of Mangal Sen.
By the deed of relinquishment, she renounced her claim for maintenance in respect of all the properties left by Mangal Sen including the two items which she got under the 'Tamliknama '.
After the ' Tamliknama ' was executed in her favour, there Was no further question of her claiming any right of maintenance in respect of these two items of property.
She became the absolute owner thereof in exchange of her rights of maintenance over the entire estate and this right of maintenance she gave up by the deed of relinquish ment.
On a construction of the entire document, my conclu sion is that there is nothing in the context of the docu ment, or in the surrounding circumstances which would dis place the presumption of full proprietory rights which the use of the word ""Malik"" is apt ordinarily to convey.
The first contention of the appellant, therefore, succeeds and in view of my decision on this point, the second question does not arise for determination at all.
The result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the High Court are set aside and those of the trial Judge restored.
The defendant No. 6 will have his costs from the plaintiff in all the courts.
There will be no order for costs as regards the other parties: 780 FAZL ALI J.
I agree with the judgment delivered by my learned brother, Mukherjea J. CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
During the hearing of the appeal I entertained doubts whether the view taken by the High Court was not correct.
But on further consideration, I find that it cannot be maintained, having regard to the terms of the ' Tamliknama ' (deed of transfer) in favour of Musammat Meria and the context in which it came into exist ence.
The name of the document or deed does not very much matter.
Though the word ' malik ' is not a term of art, it has been held in quite a large number of cases, decided mostly by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, that the word, as employed in Indian documents, means absolute owner and that unless the context indicated a different meaning, its use would be sufficient to convey a full title even without the addition of the words, ' heirs ', or ' son ', ' grandson ' and ' great grandson '.
Of course, if there are other clauses in the document which control the import of the word and restrict the estate to a limited one, we must give the narrower meaning; otherwise the word must receive its full significance.
Especially is this so, when the rule of interpretation laid down in Mohammed Shamsul vs Sewak Ram( ') has come to be regarded as unsound.
The language employed in the ' Tamliknama ' (exhibit II) is almost similar to the language of the deeds construed in Bhaidas Shivdas vs Bai Gulab & Another( '2) and Bishunath Prasad Singh vs Chandika Prasad Kumari and Others(s) where it was held that an absolute estate was conveyed.
I agree that the judgment and decree of the High Court should be set aside and that the decree of the trial Judge should be restored with costs to the appellant in all the Courts.
Appeal allowed.
","In construing a document whether in English or in vernacular the fundamental rule is to ascertain the inten tion from the words used; the surrounding circumstances are to be considered but that is only for the purpose of finding out the intended meaning of the words which have actually been employed.
To convey an absolute estate to a Hindu female, no express power of alienation need be given; it is enough if words of such amplitude are used as would convey full rights of ownership.
The term 'Malik ' when used in a will or other document as descriptive of the position which a devisee or donee is intended to held, has been held apt to describe in owner possessed of full proprietory rights, including a full right of alienation, unless there is something in the context or in the surrounding circumstances to indicate that such full proprietory rights were not intended be conferred to 767 The mere fact that a gift of property is made for the support and maintenance of a female relation could not be taken to be a prima facie indication of the intention of the donor, that the donee was to enjoy the property only during her life time.
The extent of interest, which the donee is to take, depends upon the intention of the donor as ex pressed by the language used, and if the dispositive words employed in the document are clear and unambiguous and import absolute ownership, the purpose of the grant would not, by itself, restrict or cut down the interest.
The desire to provide maintenance or rcsidence of the donee would only show the motive which prompted the donor to make the gift, but it could not be read as a measure of the extent of the gift.
Where a Hindu died leaving two widows, a widowed daugh terin law and a daughter 's son, and a relative of the family acting as guardian of the daughter 's son 's son who was then the nearest reversioner got a relinquishment deed from the daughter in law renouncing all her claims to the estate and in return executed a deed of 'tamlikhama ' to her with re spect to certain properties which ran as follows: ""I have therefore, of my own accord and free will, without any compulsion or coercion on the part of any one else while in my proper senses made a Tamlik of a double storied pucca built shop . . and a house and a kothri in Etawah . . worth Rs. 8,000 for purposes of residence of the Musammat (the daughter in law) owned by the minor aforesaid . . which present stands let out on out on rent to Sunder Lal, brother of Mst.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
The decision of these four ap peals, which are connected with each other and which have arisen out of orders made by the High Court of Patna in four Miscellaneous Appeals, depends on the interpretation of section 7 of the Bihar Moneylenders (Regulation of Transac tions) Act, 1939.
The facts which have led to the appeals are found brief ly stated in the petition filed by the present appellants in the 3rd Court of Sub Judge, Patna, and may be re stated here for convenient reference : ""The father of the petitioners borrowed Rs. 40,000 from the guru (ancestor) of the decree holder under mortgage bond, dated 11 1 1893.
Out of Rs. 40,370 7 6 interest and compound interest up to 4 1 1910, Rs. 32,370 7 6 was paid in cash and for the balance Rs. 8,000 interest and Rs. 40,000 principal, i,e., for Rs, 48,000 a Mortgage Suit No. 14 of 1910 was filed in1st Court of the Sub Judge, Patna, and in lieu of the claim and cost of the said suit two fresh mortgage bonds were executed on 11 7 1910, viz., one for Rs. 40,000 and the other for Rs. 9,488 and the latter bond was satisfied by payment of Rs. 15,835 in cash.
With respect to the above bond of Rs. 40,000, dated 11 7 1910 the petitioners paid Rs. 38,530 13 6.
Mort , gage Suit No. 110 of 1927 was brought in the 3rd Court of the Sub Judge, Patna, and a decree for Rs. 58,012 2.0 was passed on 9 7 1929.
Out of this Rs. 5,000 was paid in cash and for the balance of Rs. 53,012 12 0 one mortgage bond dated 6 10 1931 was executed for Rs. 42,000 and on the same date two 140 hand notes were executed, viz., one for Rs. 5,000 and one for Rs. 6012 2 0.
One Suit No. 14 of 1933 for both the hand notes was brought in 3rd Court of the Sub Judge and a decree for Rs. 15,008 2 0 was passed on 28 2 1935.
This decree is under execution.
"" When the decree holder sought to execute the money decree by attachment and sale of the judgmentdebtors ' properties stating that they were subject to a mortgage lien of Rs. 62,272 13 0 under the mortgage bond dated 6 10 1931, the two judgment debtors, who are brothers, filed objec tions under sections 11 and 16 of the earlier Bihar Money lenders Act III of 1938 and section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code.
The petitions (two by each of them) were filed separately by the brothers.
They urged that on a proper calculation under section 11 no lien was subsisting on the properties owing to payments made towards the mort gage debt amounting to Rs. 92,394 2 0.
The Subordinate Judge held that this plea of the judgment debtors could not be entertained in the Miscellaneous case before him relating to the execution and all that could be done was to notify the mortgage encumbrance without deciding anything as to the correctness of the amount claimed to be due under it; and this conclusion was partly based on the fact that section 16 of the Act had been declared by the High Court void.
Ap peals taken to the High Court were dismissed.
The judgment debtors thereupon preferred an appeal to the Feder al Court, contending that sections 7 and 13 of the new Act (corresponding to sections 7 and 11 of the old Act)were applicable and that it was the duty of the court to estimate the value of the property after making the necessary calcu lations under section 7 with reference to the lien.
The decision of the Federal Court is reported in Ramnandan Prasad Narain Singh and Another vs Kulpati Shri Mahanth Goshwarni Madhwanand Ramji(1).
The case was remitted back to the High (1) 141 Court, giving liberty to the appellants to file an applica tion under section 13.
In answer to a fresh application for execution dated 2 7 1042, the two brothers filed the same objections as before.
Miscellaneous Cases Nos. 45 and 46 of 1942 related to sections 7 and 13 of the Bihar Money lenders Act and Miscellaneous Cases Nos. 50 and 52 of 1042 related to the objections under section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
The Subordinate Judge held that the amount of the loan should be taken as the amount mentioned in the mortgage deed of 1931 and not the amount advanced in 1893 and that a sum of Rs. 70,840 was still due on the bond.
He determined the market value of the several properties given as security, adopting 16 times the net income as the basis.
Appeals to the High Court were numbered as M.A. 108 to 111 of 1943 and they were heard by Manohar Lall and Imam JJ.
They modified the order of the lower Court in certain re spects.
Even according to them the amount of the loan was what was mentioned in the mortgage bond of 6 10 1931, but as a sum of Rs. 11,855 3 0 had been repaid expressly towards the principal amount after the date of the bond, that amount became reduced to Rs. 28,150.
Adding an equal sum by way of interest which according to them was the maximum amount, permitted to be allowed under section 7 of the Act, the total liability was stated to be Rs. 56,300 and a charge was declared on the property for this amount.
They also directed that the valuation of the property should be fixed at twenty times the net income and not sixteen times.
It is from this order that the present appeals have been preferred.
Two points were urged on behalf of the appellants, namely (a) that the decree holder was barred by construc tive res judicata from contending that the construction placed upon section 7 by the judgmentdebtors was wrong; and (b) that in applying section 7, we must consider the origi nal amount of loan of Rs. 40,000 given in the year 1893 and allow the claim 142 of interest only for that maximum sum, after taking into account all sums paid by the appellants and their predeces sors towards interest since 1893.
The first point is entirely without substance.
When the decree holder contended that section 11 of the Bihar Money lenders Act, 1938, was declared void and ultra vires and that therefore section 7 of the new Act which corresponded to section 11 was also inapplicable, the judgment debtors pleaded that they were entitled to the benefit of section 7 of the new Act.
The Federal Court held in Ramnandan Prasad Narain Singh and Another vs Kulpati Shri Mahanth Goshwami Madhwanand Ramji(1) that the judgment debtors (present appellants) were entitled to claim the benefit of the provi sions of the new Act when the executing court proceeded under section 13 to determine the value of the properties to be sold.
The correct interpretation of section 7 was not in question between the parties.
To say that the appellants were entitled to take advantage of the provisions of section 7 is entirely different from the contention that the inter pretation sought to be put by them on section 7 was the right one.
The Federal Court was not dealing with any question of interpretation at all.
It is impossible to see where the doctrine of constructive res judicata comes in, so as to be of help to the appellants.
The second question raised on their behalf relates to the true meaning of section 7 of the Bihar Moneylenders (Regulation of Transactions) Act VII of 1939, which is in these terms: ""7.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary con tained in any other law or in anything having the force of law or in any agreement, no Court shall, in any suit brought by a money lender before or after the commencement of this Act in respect of a loan advanced before or after the com mencement of this Act or in any appeal or proceedings in revision arising out of such suit, pass a decree for an amount of interest for the period preceding the institution of the suit, (1) 143 which together with any amount already realised as interest through the court or otherwise, is greater than the amount of loan advanced, or, if the loan is based on a document, the amount of loan mentioned in, or evidenced by, such document.
"" In the present case, the original loan of Rs. 40,000 was advanced as early as 11 1 1893.
The appellants j contend that for the purposes of calculating the interest to be decreed prior to the date of the suit the loan advanced must be taken to be the original sum and that if an account is taken of all the sums received by the creditor as interest from that date up to the date of the suit, there would be nothing due for interest.
On the other hand, the decree holder urges that having regard to the latter part of the section, the loan must be taken to be the amount mentioned in the mortgage bond dated 8 10 1931, namely Rs. 42,000.
Whichever method of calculation is adopted, it must be remembered that it has to be made not for the purposes of passing any decree on the mortgage loan, but for estimating under section 13 of the Act the value of the properties to be brought to sale in execution of the money decree against the appellants.
As pointed out by Sir Maurice Gwyer C.J. in Surendra Prasad Narain Singh vs Sri Gajadhar Prasad Sahu Trust Estate and Otherse), ""Section 7 of the Act of 1937 is no doubt extremely obscure and illdrawn.
"" The true intention of the framers of the Act is somewhat difficult to gather.
But the Patna High Court has been consistently placing upon the section an interpretation which is opposed to the contention of the appellant in these proceedings.
The point came up expressly for decision in Singhesh war Singh and Others vs Madni Prasad Singh Others(2) where a mortgage bond was executed on 31 8 1922 for a sum of Rs. 2,000 which was the balance of the principal and inter est due under a mortgage bond of the 11th of October, 1912, for (1) (2)A.T.R. 1940 Pat.
65. 19 144 Rs. 1,391.
The judgment debtors raised the plea that the court should go back to the earlier bond of 1912 and that as a sum of Rs. 1,512 had been paid as and by way of interest towards that bond, no decree could be passed against them for more than the principal sum of Rs. 1,391.
The learned Judges rejected this contention and took the amount stated in the document of 1922, namely Rs. 2,000, as the loan and they held that the plaintiffs were entitled to get a decree for interest for a sum not larger than Rs. 2,000 as no payment had been proved to have been made after the execution of the bond.
The same view was taken in Lal Singh vs Ramnarain Ram and Others(1) and the plain tiffs were awarded a decree on the basis that the loan was to be taken as Rs. 2,909 8 0 which was the amount for which the hand note sued upon was executed and not Rs. 1,000 which was the original amount advanced upon an earlier hand note of the year 1924.
The case reported in Madho Prasad Singh vs Mukutdhari Singh and Others(2) lays down the same position.
The Full Bench decision in Deo Nandan Prasad vs Ram Prasad (3) rei terates the same view, pointing out the distinction between sections 7 and 8 of the Act and stating that while under section 8 we can go to the original loan in spite of a later document, under section 7, the loan must relate to the document on which the suit is based, that is, the final document and not the original one.
In each one of these cases, the question of the true meaning of section 7 was pointedly considered.
This construction no doubt enables a creditor to circumvent the beneficent provisions of the Act by taking a document for the interest due and adding it to the principal amount.
Gwyer C.J. points out this difficulty at page 59 in the case Surendra Prasad Narain Singh vs Sri Gajadhar Prasad Sahu Trust Estate and Others(4).
If the interpretation does not carry out the intentions of the framers of the Act by reason of unhappy or ambiguous phrasing, it is for the Legis lature to intervene.
But far from doing so, it has (1) , Patna 618.
(2) (1941) 193 I.C.661.
(4) [1940] F.C.R.39.
145 acquiesced, during all these years in the construction which the Patna High Court has been placing upon the section from the very next year after the enactment of the statute.
Having regard to the great obscurity in the language em ployed in the relevant provisions and the inaction of the Legislature, it is, in our opinion, legitimate to infer that the view expressed by the Patna High Court is in accord with the intention of the Legislature.
The appeals fail and are dismissed with costs, only one set in all of them together.
Appeals dismissed.

","Where a fresh document is executed for the amount remaining due on account of principal and interest under a loan ad vanced prior document, and a suit is brought for recovery of the amount due under the later document with interest due thereunder, ""the amount of loan mentioned in, or evidenced by, such document"" for the purposes of section 7 of the Bihar Money Lenders Regulations and Transactions) Act, 1939, is the amount mentioned, or evidenced by, the later document and not that mentioned in the original document which was renewed; and the court can pass a decree for an amount of interest for the period preceding the institution of the suit, which together with any amount realised as interest after the date of the later document, is not greater than the amount of loan mentioned in the later document.
The maximum amount that can be so decreed is not the amount which together with the interest realised from the date of the original loan does not exceed the original loan.

The Judgment of Kania C.J., Fazl Ali, Mukherjea and Chandrasekhara Aiyar JJ., was delivered by Kania C.J. Patanjali Sastri and Das JJ.
delivered separate judgments.
KANIA C.J. This is an appeal under article 132 of the Constitution of India from the judgment of the 214 High Court at Calcutta, which rejected the habeas corpus petitions of the appellants.
The detention orders under the , in all cases were served on the appellants on the 26th February, 1950, and the grounds for the detention were served on the 14th March, 1950.
By way of specimen we quote one of them: ""You are beings detained in pursuance of a detention order made under sub clause (ii) of clause (a) of subsection (1)of section a of the , (Act IV of 1950), on the following grounds: (1) That you have been assisting the operations of the Communist Party of India, which along with its volunteer organisations has been declared unlawful by Government under section 16 of the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act (Act XIV of 1908), and which has for its object commission of rioting with deadly weapons, robbery, dacoity, arson and murder and possession and use of arms and ammunitions and explosives and thus acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and that it is necessary to prevent you from acting in such manner.
(2) That as a member of the C.P.I. on its Kishan front, you have fomented trouble amongst the peasants of Howrah District and incited them to acts of lawlessness and vio lence: and have thereby acted in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order: That as a worker of the C.P.I. you have tried to foment trouble amongst the tramways men and other workers at Cal cutta and in speeches which you delivered at the University Hall and other places you actually incited them to resort to acts of violence and lawlessness; and have thereby acted in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
"" On the 16th of July, 1950, the Government of West Bengal served on the appellants ""in continuation of the grounds already furnished on the 14th of March, 1950, supplementary grounds"" for their detention a specimen of which is in the following terms: 215 ""In continuation of the grounds already furnished under order No. 6163 H.S. dated 14th March, 1950, you are being informed of the supplementary grounds for your detention which are as follows: You as the Secretary of the Bengal Chatkar Mazdoor Union, as a member of the Executive Committee of the Federa tion of Mercantile Employees ' Union, as the honorary report er of the 'Khabar ' newspaper (C. P.I. organ) carried on the disruptive programme of the C.P.I.
On the 29th July, 1948, you along with others led a procession at Howrah preaching discontent against Government and have been thus acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order. ' ' As in the case of the first grounds, these ""supplemen tary grounds"" were also served on each appellant separately.
The appellants applied for a Rule of habeas corpus separate ly under section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code and on the 21st July, 1950, the High Court issued a Rule in each case on the Chief Secretary to the Government of West Ben gal.
A second set of grounds were communicated to the appellants on the 22nd or 23rd of July, 1950.
A specimen of one is in the following terms: ""In continuation of the grounds already furnished under order No. 12820 dated 14th July, 1950, you are being in formed of the supplementary grounds for your detention which are as follows: 1.
That in a meeting held at the University Institute on the 19th March, 1947, under the auspices of the Calcutta Tramway Workers ' Union, you held out the threat that any attempt to take out tram cars on the 20th March, 1947, would be inviting disaster and you further said that if the au thorities tried to resume the tram service you and your friends would not hesitate to remove the tram lines and cut the wires.
That on the 13th June, 1948, you presided over a meeting under the auspices of the Students ' Federation (C. P.I. controlled) and delivered speech 28 216 advocating withdrawal of ban on the Communist Party of India and its organ Swadhinta."" The High Court after considering the whole matter re jected the petitions of the appellants and the appellants have thereupon come in appeal before us.
In the High Court, it was first contended on behalf of the appellants that the communication of the grounds dated the 14th March was not a compliance with article 22 (5)of the Constitution of India, as those grounds were not commu nicated ""as soon as may be.
"" The High Court rejected this contention.
Under the circumstances of the case, we agree with the High Court and are unable to hold that in furnish ing the grounds dated the 14th March, 1950, the authorities had failed to act in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 22 (5) of the Constitution.
Under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1930, a very large number of persons were detained.
The validity of that Act was being challenged in the High Court and the judgment was expected to be delivered towards the end of February, 1950.
The , was passed by the Parliament of India in the last week of February, 1950, and these orders on all those detenus were served on the 26th of February, 1950.
Having regard to the fact that the Provin cial Government had thus suddenly to deal with a large number of cases on one day, we are unable to accept this contention of the appellants.
On behalf of the appellants it was next urged that there has been a non compliance with the procedure laid down in article 22 (s)of the Constitution and section 7 of the in the manner of supplying grounds to the appellants resulting in not providing to the appel lants the earliest opportunity to make a representation, which they had a right to make.
In the judgment delivered today in Case No. 22 of 1950(1) we have discussed in detail the nature of the two rights conferred under article 22 (5).
We have to apply those principles to the facts of this appeal for its decision.
(11 Supra, P. 167. 217 When the authorities sent their second communication dated 16th July, 1950, to the appellants they described it as ""in continuation of the grounds already furnished"" and as the ""supplementary grounds for your detention"".
Relying on the wording of this communication it was argued that these were additional grounds which were furnished to the detenu and therefore the procedure prescribed under article 22 (5) had not been followed.
It was argued that the obligation to communicate grounds ""as soon as may be"" was absolute.
The grounds for detention must be before the Provincial Government before they could be satisfied about the necessity for making the detention order.
If the grounds before the detaining authorities on the 26th of February, 1950, were only those which they communicated on the 14th of March, they cannot support the detention on additional grounds which were not before them on that day and which they set out in the second communication four months later.
It was also contended that the fact of this communication showed that the authorities were not satisfied on the origi nal grounds and had therefore put forth these supplementary grounds as an afterthought.
In our opinion these arguments cannot be accepted.
A 'description of the contents of the second communication as ""supplementary grounds"" does not necessarily make them additional or new grounds.
One has to look at the contents to find out whether they are new grounds as explained in our judgment in Case No. 92 of 1950(1).
Examining the contents of the later communication in that way we find that they only furnish details of the second heads of the grounds furnished to the appropriate appellant on 14th March, 1950, in respect of his activities.
We are unable to treat them as new grounds and we agree with the High Court in its conclusion that these are not fresh or new grounds.
We do not think it proper to consider the true effect of the communication only by reading its opening words.
The whole of it must be read and considered togeth er.
The contention that the authorities were not satisfied on the original (1) Supra, p. 167.
218 grounds and therefore put forth this.
communication as the supplemental grounds is again unsound.
The fact that these details were communicated later does not necessarily show that they were not within the knowledge of the authorities when they sent the communication dated the 14th of March.
The contention that this communication of the 16th of July, 1950, was not ""as soon as may be"", has to be rejected having regard to the principles set out in our judgment in Case No. 22 of 1950.
The facts in each case have to to be taken into consideration and if the detained person contends that this part of the procedure prescribed in article 22 (5) was not complied with, the authorities will have to place materials before the court to refute that contention.
In the present case the High Court has considered that there has been no infringement of this procedural law and we see no reason to come to a different conclusion.
It was next argued that the grounds being vague, they could not be considered as grounds at all and therefore they could not be sufficient ""to satisfy"" the authorities.
On this point we have nothing to add to what we have stated in our judgment in Case No. 22 of 1950.
We are unable to accept the contention that ""vague grounds"" stand on the same footing as ""irrelevant grounds"".
An irrelevant ground has no connection at all with the satisfaction of the Provincial Government which makes the order of detention.
For the reasons stated in that judgment we are also unable to accept the contention that if the grounds are vague and no repre sentation is possible there can be no satisfaction of the authority as required under section 3 of the .
This argument mixes up two objects.
The sufficiency of the grounds, which gives rise to the satis faction of the Provincial Government, is not a matter for examination by the court.
The sufficiency of the grounds to give the detained person the earliest opportunity to make a representation can be examined by the court, but only from that point of view.
We are therefore unable to accept the contention that the quality and characteristic of 219 the grounds should be the same for both tests.
On the ques tion of satisfaction, as has been often stated, one person may be, but another may not be, satisfied on the same grounds.
That aspect however is not for the determination of the court, having regard to the words used in the Act.
The second part of the enquiry is clearly open to the court under article 22 (5).
We are therefore unable to accept the argument that if the grounds are not sufficient or adequate for making the representation the grounds cannot be suffi cient for the subjective satisfaction of the authority.
As regards the grounds furnished by the Government in each case in its first communication, it is sufficient to notice that while the first ground is common to all the appellants, the second ground is different in most cases.
The High Court has considered the case of each appellant in respect of the communication dated the 14th of March, 1950, sent to him.
In their opinion those grounds are not vague.
They have held that the procedural requirement to give the detained person the earliest opportunity to make a represen tation has not been infringed by the communication of the grounds of the 14th of March and by the subsequent communi cation made to the appellants in July.
This point was not seriously pressed before us.
After hearing counsel for the appellant we see no reason to differ from the conclusion of the High Court on this point.
The result is that the appeal fails and is dismissed.
PATANJALI SASTRI J.
This appeal was heard along with Case No. 22 of 1950 (The State of Bombay vs Atma Ram Sridhar Vaidya)(1), as the main question involved was the same.
In the view I have expressed on that question in my judgment delivered today in that case, this appeal cannot succeed and I agree that it should be dismissed.
DAS J.
The same important questions have been raised in this appeal by 100 detenus against an order of a Bench of the Calcutta High Court as were raised (1) Supra, p. 167, 220 by the detenu in the appeal of the State of Bombay in which judgment has just been delivered.
One additional point raised in this appeal was that the fact that a large number of fresh orders of detention were made ""overnight"" indicates bad faith on the part of the authorities, for the authori ties could not have applied their minds to each individual case.
I am unable to accept this contention as correct.
The authorities had already applied their minds to the suspected activities of each of the detenus and were satisfied that with a view to prevent them from doing some prejudicial act of a particular kind it was necessary to make an order of detention against them under the local Acts.
There being doubt as to the validity of the local Acts and the Preven tive Detention Act having been passed in the meantime the question was to make a fresh order under the new Act.
The minds of the authorities having already been made up as to the expediency of making an order of detention against them, an elaborate application of mind, such as is now suggested, does not appear to me to be necessary at all.
I do not think there was any failure of duty on the part of the authorities which will establish bad faith on their part.
In my view, for reasons stated in my judgment in the other appeal, there being no proof of any mala fides on the part of the authori ties, no fundamental rights of the petitioners have been infringed.
In the case of each of the detenus, apart from the common ground, there were one or more specific grounds of detention which are quite sufficient to enable the detenu concerned to make his representation.
Therefore, the ques tion of supplementary particulars does not arise at all.
In my opinion the conclusions arrived at by Roxburgh J. were correct and well founded, and, therefore, this appeal should be dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
","A large number of persons were detained under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1930.
The validity of this Act was being challenged in the High Court.
Meanwhile, the Preventive Detention Act of 1950 was passed on 26th Febru ary, 1950, and on the same date detention orders under this Act were served on them.
The grounds of detention were served on them on the 14th of March, and on the 16th of July the Government served on them ""supplementary grounds"" in continuation of the grounds already furnished on the 14th of March.
A second set of grounds were communicated to the appellants on the 22nd or 23rd of July.
They applied to the High Court of Calcutta for writs of habeas corpus contending that the orders of detention were invalid on various grounds.
The High Court rejected these applications and they appealed to the ' Supreme Court.
Held per KANIA C.J., FAZAL ALI, MUKHERJEA and CHANDRASEK HARA AIYAR JJ. (i) that in the particular circumstances of the case, especially in view of the fact that a large number of causes had to be dealt with on the passing of the Preven tive Detention Act in February, 1950, it cannot be said that the grounds were not communicated to the appellants ""as soon as nay be"" within the meaning of article 22 (5); ' 213 (ii) it cannot be held that the appellants were not given the ""earliest opportunity"" to make a representation, as required by article 22(5), merely because further details and facts were communicated to the appellants on the 16th July and 22nd July as these later communications did not contain any new or additional grounds (though they were described as ""supplementary grounds "") but only furnished details of the heads of grounds furnished on the 14th March; (iii) merely because a ground is vague it cannot be considered that it is no ground at all and therefore cannot be sufficient to ' satisfy '.the authorities; a ' vague ' ground does not stand on the same footing as an irrelevant ground, which can have no connection at all with the satis faction of the Government; (iv) the sufficiency of the grounds for the purposes of satisfaction of the Government is not a matter for examina tion by the court; their sufficiency to give the detained person the earliest opportunity to make a representation can be examined by the court, but only from that point of view.
Held also, per DAS J.
The fact that a large number of fresh orders of detention were made overnight did not neces sarily indicate bad faith on the part of the authorities in the circumstances of these cases as the authorities had already applied their minds to the suspected activities of each of the detenus and were satisfied that with a view to prevent them from doing some prejudicial act, it was neces sary to detain them.

Application under article 32 of the Constitution for a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari and prohibition.

General for India, (section M. Sikri, with him) for the respondent.
january 12.
This is said to be a test case, for, on its decision, we are told, depend the rights of numerous other persons whose interests are similar to those of the petitioner.
There is no serious controversy as to the facts material for the purposes of this application.
They are shortly as follows: On May 5, 1948, the then Rulers of eight Punjab States including.
Patiala and Nabha with the concurrence and guarantee of the Government of India entered into a covenant agreeing to unite and integrate their territories in one State with a common executive, legislature and judiciary by the name of Patiala and East Punjab States Union, hereinaf ter compendiously referred to as the Pepsu.
By article III (6) of the covenant the then Ruler of Patiala became the first President or Raj Pramukh of the Council of Rulers and he is to hold the office during his lifetime.
Article VI of the covenant is as follows : ""(1) The Ruler of each Covenanting State shall, as soon as may be practicable, and in any event not later than the 20th of August, 1948, make over the administration of his State to the Raj Pramukh, and thereupon, (a) all rights, authority and jurisdiction belonging to the Ruler which appertain, or are incidental to the Govern ment of the Covenanting State shall vest in 130 the Union and shall thereafter be exercisable only as pro vided by this Covenant or by the Constitution to be framed thereunder; (b) all duties and obligations of the Ruler pertaining or incidental to the Government of the Covenanting State shall devolve on the Union and shall be discharged by it; (c) all the assets and liabilities of the Covenanting State shall be the assets and liabilities of the Union, and (d) the military forces, if any, of the Covenanting State shall become the military forces of the Union.
"" Article X provides for the formation of a Constituent Assembly to frame a constitution of a unitary type for the Union within the framework of the Covenant and the Constitu tion of India.
This Constituent Assembly was also to func tion as the interim Legislalature of the Union until an elected legislature came into being.
The proviso to clause (2) of that Article runs as follows : ""Provided that until a Constitution framed by the Con stituent Assembly comes into operation after receiving the assent of the Raj Pramukh, the Raj Pramukh shall have power to make and promulgate Ordinances for the peace and good government of the Union or any part thereof, and any Ordi nance so made shall, for the space of not more than six months from its promulgation have the like force of law as an Act passed by the Constituent Assembly;but any such Ordinance may be controlled or superseded by any such Act.
"" This Union was inaugurated on July 15, 1948, and the Raj Pramukh thereafter took over the administration of the different Covenanting States.
The Administration of Nabha State was taken over by the Raj Pramukh on August 20, 1948.
On the same day the Raj Pramukh, in exercise of the powers vested in him, promulgated an Ordinance (No. 1 of 2005) called the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (Administra tion) 131 Ordinance, 2005.
The following provisions of this Ordi nance are relevant for our purpose: ""1.
(2) It shall extend to the territories included in the Covenanting States on and from the date on which the administration of any of the said State or States has been or is made over to the Raj Pramukh.
* * 3.
As soon as the administration of any Covenanting State has been taken over by the Raj Pramukh as aforesaid, all laws, Ordinances, Acts, Rules, Regulations, Notifica tions, Hidayats and Firrnans i Shahi having force of law in Patiala State on the date of commencement of this Ordinance shall apply mutatis mutandis to the territories of the said State and with effect from that date all laws in force in such covenanting State immediately before that date shall be repealed: Provided that proceedings of any nature whatsoever pending on such date in the Courts or offices of any such Covenanting State shall, notwithstanding anything contained in this Ordinance or any other Ordinance, be disposed of in accordance with the laws governing such proceedings in force for the time being m any such Covenanting State.
"" Section 6 provides for the adaptation of the laws etc.
enforced under section 3 and, amongst other things, any reference in these laws etc.
to the Patiala State and the like was to be construed as a reference to the State of the Union.
A notification (No.35 dated 27 5 05/11 9 1948) was issued over the signature of the Revenue Secretary notifying that the Patiala Income tax Act of 2001 and the Rules there under had come into force in the various Covenanting States from August 20, 1948, thereby repealing the law or laws in force in that behalf in those States before that date, except as to pending proceedings.
It may be mentioned here that prior to that date there was no law in the Nabha State imposing income tax on the subjects of that State.
On November 14, 1948, the Commissioner of Income tax issued a Notification (No. 4, dated 132 29 7 2005) intimating that persons belonging to the Cove nanting States of Nabha and Nalagarh would be assessed to income tax under the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001.
It was mentioned that persons of those States whose income reached the taxable limit ' 'should henceforward keep regular and proper accounts for purposes of audit by the Income Tax Department"" on February 2, 1949, Ordinance 1 of 2005 was repealed and replaced by Ordinance No. XVI of 2005 promul gated by the Raj Pramukh and called the Patiala and East Punjab States Union General Provisions (Administration) Ordinance, 2006.
Section 3 (1) runs as follows: ""3.
(1) As from the appointed day, all laws and rules, regulations, bye laws and notifications made thereunder, and all other provisions having the force of law, in Patiala State on the said day shall apply mutatis mutandis to the territories of the Union and all laws in force in the other Covenanting States immediately before that day shall cease to have effect; Provided that all suits, appeals, revisions applica tions, reviews, executions and other proceedings, or any of them, whether Civil or Criminal or Revenue, pending in the Courts and before authorities of any Covenanting States shall, notwithstanding anything contained in this Ordinance, be disposed of in accordance with the laws governing such proceedings in force in any such Covenanting State immedi ately before the appointed day.
"" By section 2 (a) the ""appointed day"" was defined as meaning the 5th day of Bhadon, 2005, corresponding to August 20, 1948.
There was a section providing for adaptation similar to section 6 of the Ordinance 1 of 2005.
There was another Ordinance to which reference has to be made, namely, Ordinance No. 1 of 2006 called the Finance Ordinance promul gated on April 13, 1949, which came into force on that very date.
Section 5 of that Ordinance introduced several amend ments to the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001.
It recast 133 sections 3 and 34 of that Act and introduced a new section as section 23B. Section 6 of that Ordinance runs thus: ""6.
For the assessment year beginning on the 1st day of Baisakh, 2006, that is to say, in respect of the accounting the income, profits and gains of the previous year ending on the last day of Chet, 2005, (a) income tax shall be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the Second Schedule to this Ordinance, and (b) rates of super tax shall, for the purposes of sec tion 55 of the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001, be specified in Part II of the Second Schedule to this Ordinance.
"" It is in this setting that the facts leading to the present petition have to be considered.
The petitioner is a resident of Ateli in the district of Mohindargarh now in Pepsu but which formerly formed part of the Nabha State.
The petitioner has been carrying on his business at Ateli for a number of years under the ' name and style of Raghunath Rai Ram Parshad.
He never paid any income tax as no such tax was imposed by any law in the Nabha State.
On October '20, 1949, the petitioner was served with a notice under sections 22(2) and 88 of the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001, requiring him to submit a return for the Income Tax year 2006 (13 4 1949 to 12 4 1950) disclosing his income during the previous year (13 4 1948 to 12 4 1949).
The petitioner, on December 4, 1949, filed his return for the year 2006 and on February 14, 1950, he was assessed to income tax.
On May 23, 1950, the petitioner received a notice under section 34 calling upon him to file his return for the year ending the last day of Chet 2005, i.e., for the year 13 4 1948 to 12 4 1949.
In this return he had to specify his income of the previous year, namely, 2004 (i.e., 13 4 1947 to 12 4 1948).
It ap pears that the petitioner along with other assessees of Ateli and Kanina submitted a petition before the Income Tax Officer on July 9, 1950, asking him not to 134 proceed with the assessment for the year 2005 but on July 13, 1950, the Income Tax Officer assessed him to the best of his judgment under section 34(4) read with section 22(4) of the Income Tax Act.
The petitioner along with other asses sees similarly situated moved the Income Tax Commissioner and the Central Board of Revenue, New Delhi, but without any success.
No formal appeal under the Patiala Income Tax Act appears to have been filed by the petitioner against assess ments for either of the two years 2005 and 2006.
On August 10, 1950, the petitioner filed his present petition before this Court under article 32 of the Constitution praying that a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari be issued for quashing the assessments of the petitioner 's income accrued in the years 2004 and 2005 and other ancillary reliefs.
During the pendency of this petition the income tax authori ties have issued a notice under section 46 intimating that penalty will be imposed if the tax was not paid up.
The contention of the petitioner in the first place is that he has been denied the fundamental right of equality before the law and the equal protection of the laws guaran teed to him by article 14 of the Constitution.
His griev ances are formulated in paragraphs 10 and 11 of his peti tion.
It is said that while the people of Kapurthala which is included in Pepsu have been asked to pay income tax for the period prior to August 20, 1948, at the old rate fixed by the Kapurthala Income Tax Act which was lower than the rate fixed by the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001, the people of Nabha who had not to pay any income tax prior to August 20, 1948, at all have been made liable to pay at the higher Patiala rate and that such discrimination offends against the provisions of article 14.
This charge is refuted by paragraph 10 of the affidavit of Sardar Gurbax Singh, the Additional Director of Inspection (income Tax), New Delhi, who was formerly the Commissioner of Income Tax, Punjab and Pepsu, which has been filed in opposition to the present petition.
It is there stated that for the assessment year 2005, in Kapurthala the assessees whose cases were pending on 135 August 20, 1948, were assessed under the Kapurthala Income Tax Act at rates fixed thereunder but that for the assess ment year 2006 the provisions of the Patiala Income Tax Act and the rates prescribed thereunder were uniformly applied in all areas of the Pepsu, including Kapurthala This alle gation which is not denied in the affidavit filed by the petitioner in reply must be taken as correct.
The assess ment of Kapurthala assessees for the year 2005 at the old Kapurthala rate was obviously made under the proviso to section 3 of Ordinance No. 1 of 2005, which was reproduced in the proviso to section 3(1)of the Ordinance No. XVI of 2006 and both of which required all pending proceedings to be completed according to the law applicable to those pro ceedings when they were initiated.
No case of assessment was pending as against any Nabha assessee on August 20, 1948, for there was no Income Tax Act in Nabha prior to that date and, therefore, there could be no occasion for completing any pending proceedings against any of such assessees.
In the premises, there can be no grievance by them on the score of discrimination.
The discrimination, if any, was not brought about by the two Ordinances, but by the circumstance that there was no Income Tax Act in Nabha and consequently there was no case of assessment pending against any Nabha assessees.
In any case the provision that pending proceed ings should be concluded according to the law applicable at the time when the rights or liabilities accrued and the proceedings commenced is a reasonable law rounded upon a reasonable classification of the assessees which is permis sible under the equal protection clause and to which no exception can be taken.
In our opinion the grievance of the alleged infringement of fundamental right under Article 14 is not well founded at all.
Dr. Tek Chand appearing in support of the petition next contends that the administration of Nabha State having been taken over by the Raj Pramukh only on August 20, 1948, and the Patiala law including the Patiala Income Tax Act, 2001, having been brought 136 into operation on and from August 20, 1948, the assessment of the tax on the petitioner 's income which accrued prior to August 20, 1948, was wholly illegal and not authorised by the said Ordinances and the State by insisting on collecting the tax so illegally assessed was threatening to invade the petitioner 's fundamental right to property guaranteed by article 31(1) of the Constitution.
Article 31(1) runs as follows: ""(1) No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law.
"" It will be noticed that clause (1) reproduces subsection (1) of section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935, without the words ""in British India.
"" Reference has 'next to be made to article 265 which is in Part XII, Chapter I, dealing with ""Finance."" That article provides that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law.
There 'was no similar provision in the corresponding chapter of the Government of India Act, 1935.
If collection of taxes amounts to deprivation of property within the meaning of article 31(1), then there was no point in making a sepa rate provision again as has been made in article 265.
It, therefore, follows that clause (1) of article 31 must be regarded as concerned with deprivation of property otherwise than by the imposition or collection of tax, for otherwise article 265 becomes wholly redundant.
In the United States of America the power of taxation is regarded as distinct from the exercise of police power or eminent domain.
Our Constitution evidently has also treated taxation as distinct from compulsory acquisition of property and has made inde pendent provision giving protection against taxation save by authority of law.
When Dr. Tek Chand was asked if that was not the correct position, he did ,not advance any cogent or convincing answer to refute the conclusion put to him.
In our opinion, the protection against imposition and collec tion of taxes save by authority of law directly comes from article 265, and is not secured by clause (1) of article 31.
Article 265, 137 not being in Chapter IIi of the Constitution, its protection is not a fundamental right which can be enforced by an application to this court under article 32.
It is not our purpose to say that the right secured by article 265 may not be enforced.
It may certainly be enforced by adopting proper proceedings.
All that we wish to state is that this application in so far as it purports to be rounded on arti cle 32 read with article 31(1) to this Court is misconceived and must fail.
The whole of Dr. Tek Chand 's argument was rounded on the basis that protection against imposition and collection of taxes save by authority of law was guaranteed by article 31(1) and his endeavour was to establish that the Pepsu Ordinances could not, in law, and did not, on a correct interpretation of them, impose any income tax retrospective ly; that the Income Tax Officer on an erroneous view of the law had wrongly assessed the tax on income accrued prior to August 20, 1948, and that consequently the petitioner was being threatened with deprivation of property otherwise than by authority of law.
In the view we have taken, namely, that the protection against imposition or collection of taxes save by authority of law is secured by article 265 and not by article 31(1), the questions urged by Dr. Tek Chand do not really arise and it is not necessary to express any opinion on them on this application.
Those questions can only arise in appropriate proceedings and not on an applica tion under article 32.
In our judgment this application fails on the simple ground that no fundamental right of the petitioner has been infringed either under article 14 or under article 31(1) and we accordingly dismiss the petition with costs.
Petition dismissed.
","Section 3 (1) of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union General Provisions (Administration) Ordinance (No. XVI of 2005) which came into force on February 2, 1949, and re enacted section 3 of an earlier Ordinance which was in force from August 20, 1948, provided that as from the appointed day (i.e., August 20, 1948) all laws in force in the Patiala State shall apply muutatis mutandis to 17 128 the territories of the said Union, provided that all pro ceedings pending before courts and other authorities of any of the Covenanting States shall be disposed of in accordance with the laws governing such proeeedings in force in such Covenanting State immediately before August 20, 1948.
In one of the Covenanting States, viz., Kapurthala, there was a law of income tax in force on the said date, the rate of tax payable under which was lower than that payable under the Patiala Income tax Act, and in another Covenanting State, Nabha, there was no law of income tax at all.
For the ac counting year ending April 12, 1948, assessees of Kapurthala State were assessed at the lower rates fixed by the Kapur thala Income tax Act, in accordance with the proviso in section 3 of the Ordinance relating to pending proceedings, and the assessees of Nabha were assessed at the higher rates fixed by the Patiala Act as there was no income tax law in Nabha on August 20, 1948, and no income tax proceedings were therefore pending in Nabha.
The petitioner who was an asses see residing in Nabha and who was assessed under the Patiala Act applied under article 32 of the Constitution for a writ in the nature of a writ of certiorari quashing the assessment on the ground (i) that he had been denied the fundamental right of equality before the law and equal protection of the laws guaranteed by article 14 of the Constitution inasmuch as he was assessed at a higher rate than that at which asses sees of Kapurthala were assessed, (ii) that, as the Ordi nance bringing the Patiala Income tax Act into force in Nabha was enacted only on August 20, 1948, it cannot operate retrospectively and authorise the levy of tax on income which had accrued in the year ending April 12, 1948, and therefore he was threatened with infringement of the funda mental right guaranteed by article 31 (1) of the Constitution that no one shall be deprived of his property save under authority of law: Held, (i) that the discrimination, if any, between the assessees of Kapurthala and Nabha was not brought about by the Ordinance but by the circumstance that there was no income tax law in Nabha and consequently there was no case of assessment pending against any Nabha assessees; and in any case the provision that pending proceedings should be concluded according to the applicable at the time when the right is or liabilities accrued and the proceedings com menced, was a reasonable law rounded upon reasonable classi fication of the assessees which is permissible under the equal protection clause; (ii) that, as there is a special provision in article 965 of the Constitution that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law, cl.
(1) of article 31 must be regarded as concerned with deprivation of property otherwise than by the imposition or collection of tax, and inasmuch as the right conferred by article 265 not a right conferred by Part III of the Constitution, it could not be enforced under article 129

24.txt,"nder article 132(1) of the Constitution from a judgment and order dated 12th April, 1950, of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay (Chagla C.J., Bavdekar and Shah JJ.): Case No. I X of 1950.
A.S.R. Chari, for the appellant.
M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (G. N. Joshi, with him) for the respondent.
Jan. 22.
The judgment of Kania C.J., Patanjali Sastri J. Das J. and Chandrasekhara Aiyar J. was delivered by Das J. Mahajan J. and Fazl Ali J. delivered separate judgments.
Mukherjea J. agreed with Fazl Ali J. DAs J.
At all material times the petitioner, who is the appellant before us, was the Secretary of People 's Publish ing House, Ltd., a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act with its registered office at 190 B, Khetwadi Main Road in Bombay.
In September, 1949, a pamphlet entitled ""Railway Mazdooron ke khilaf Nai Zazish"" is alleged to have been published in Bombay by the petitioner as the secretary of that company.
Learned counsel for the peti tioner states that the pamphlet was published as a ""book"" within the meaning of section 1 of the Press and Registra tion of Books Act (XXV of 1867) and that the provisions of that Act had been duly complied 230 with.
The Bombay Government authorities, however, took the view that the pamphlet was a ""news sheet"" within the meaning of section 2 (6) of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, and that as it had been published without the authori ty required by section 15 (1) of that Act, the petitioner had committed an offence punishable under section 18 (1) of the same Act.
A prosecution under that Act was accordingly started against the petitioner in the Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, and was registered as Case No. 1102/P of 1949.
During the pendency of the proceedings the Constitution of India came into force on January 26, 1950.
On March 3, 1950, the petitioner filed a written statement submitting, inter alia, that the definition of ""news sheet"" as given in section 2 (6) of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, and sections 15 and 18 thereof were ultra vires and void in view of article 19(1)(a) read with article 13 and that the hearing of the case should be stayed till the High Court decided that question of law.
This was followed up by a petition filed in the High Court on March 7, 1950, under article 228 of the Constitution, praying that the record of Case No. 1102/P of 1949 be sent for, that it be declared that sections 15 and 18 read with section 2 (6) and (10), in so far as they create liability for restrictive measure for a citizen, are ultra vires of article 19 (1) (a)and are, therefore, void and inoperative and that the petitioner be ordered to be acquitted.
During the pendency of this petition the Chief Presidency Magis trate on March 23, 1950, framed a charge against the peti tioner under section 18 of the Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931.
The petition under article 228 was heard on April 12, 1950, by a Bench of the Bombay High Court consisting of Chagla C.J. and Bavdekar and Shah JJ.
Two questions were raised before the Bench, namely (1) Whether sections 15 (1) and 18 (1) read with the definitions contained in sections 2 (6) and 2 (.10) of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, were 231 inconsistent with article 19 (1) (a) read with clause (2) of that article ? and (2) Assuming that they were inconsistent, whether the proceedings commenced under section 18 (1) of that Act before the commencement of the Constitution could neverthe less be proceeded with ? The High Court considered it unnecessary to deal with or decide the first question and disposed of the application only on the second question.
The High Court took the view that the word ""void"" was used in article 13 (1) in the sense of ""repealed"" and that consequently it attracted section 6 of the General Clauses Act, which Act by article 367 was made applicable for the interpretation of the Constitution.
The High Court, therefore, reached the conclusion that proceedings under the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, which were pending at the date of the commence ment of the Constitution were not affected, even if the Act were inconsistent with the fundamental rights conferred by article 19 (1)(a)and as such became void under article 13 (1) of the Constitution after January 26, 1950.
The High Court accordingly answered the second question in the af firmative and dismissed the petitioner 's application.
The petitioner has now come up on appeal before us on the strength of a certificate granted by the High Court under article 132 (1) of the Constitution.
Learned counsel appearing in support of this appeal urged that the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, was one of the many repressive laws enacted by an alien Government with a view to stifle the liberty of the Indian subjects and particularly of the Indian Press; that, with the advent of independence the people of India began to breathe freely and by the Constitution which they gave unto themselves they took care to guarantee to themselves the fundamental rights of free citizens of a democratic republic and that article 13 (1) of that Constitution brushed aside all vestiges of subordination which the tyranny of the alien rulers had imposed upon them and declared all 232 laws inconsistent with the fundamental rights to be void as if they had never been passed and had never existed.
It was, therefore, against the spirit of the Constitution, argued the learned counsel, that a free citizen of India should still continue to be persecuted under such a retro grade law which, being inconsistent with the fundamental rights, must be declared to be void.
Learned counsel urged that it was not necessary for him to contend that such inconsistent laws became void ab initio or that all past and closed transactions could be reopened but he contended that on and from January 26, 1950, when the Constitution came into force such inconsistent laws which became void could not be looked at for any purpose and far less could they be utilised for the purpose of framing a charge or punishing a free citizen.
As the void law cannot be utilised any long er, the pending prosecutions, according to learned counsel, must fall to the ground.
To permit pending proceedings under a law which, after the commencement of the Constitu tion had become void, to proceed further, after the Consti tution has taken effect, is to prolong the efficacy of the law notwithstanding that it has become void on and from the date the Constitution came into force and that is against the spirit of the Constitution.
An argument founded on what is claimed to be the spirit of the Constitution is always attractive, for it has a powerful appeal to sentiment and emotion; but a court of law has to gather the spirit of the Constitution from the lan guage of the Constitution.
What one may believe or think to be the spirit of the Constitution cannot prevail if the language of the Constitution does not support that view.
Article 372 (2) gives power to the President to adapt and modify existing laws by way of repeal or amendment.
There is nothing to prevent the President, in exercise of the powers conferred on him by that article, from repealing, say the whole or any part of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931.
If the President does so, then such repeal will at once attract section 6 of the General Clauses Act.
In such a situation all prosecutions under 233 the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, which were pending at the date of its repeal by the President would be saved and must be proceeded with notwithstanding the repeal of that Act unless an express provision was otherwise made in the repealing Act.
It is therefore clear that the idea of the preservation of past inchoate rights or liabili ties and pending proceedings to enforce the same is not foreign or abhorrent to the Constitution of India.
We are, therefore, unable to accept the contention about the spirit of the Constitution as invoked by the learned counsel in aid of his plea that pending proceedings under a law which has become void cannot be proceeded with.
Further, if it is against the spirit of the Constitution to continue the pending prosecutions under such a void law, surely it should be equally repugnant to that spirit that men who have al ready been convicted under such repressive law before the Constitution of India came into force should continue to rot in jail.
It is, therefore, quite clear that the court should construe the language of article 13(1) according to the established rules of interpretation and arrive at its true meaning uninfluenced by any assumed spirit of the Constitu tion.
Article 13 (1) with which we are concerned for the pur poses of this application is in these terms: ""All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.
"" It will be noticed that all that this clause declares is that all existing laws, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part II1 shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, be void.
Every statute is prima facie pro spective unless it is expressly or by necessary implications made to have retrospective operation.
There is no reason why this rule of interpretation should not be applied for the purpose of interpreting our Constitution.
We find nothing in the language of article 13 (1) which may be read as indicating an 234 intention to give it retrospective operation.
On the con trary, the language clearly points the other way.
The provi sions of Part III guarantee what are called fundamental rights.
Indeed, the heading of Part III is ""Fundamental Rights"".
These rights are given, for the first time, by and under our Constitution.
Before the Constitution came into force there was no such thing as fundamental right.
What article 13(1) provides is that all existing laws which clash with the exercise of the fundamental rights (which are for the first time created by the Constitution) shall to that extent be void.
As the fundamental rights became operative only on and from the date of the Constitution the question of the inconsistency of the existing laws with those rights must necessarily arise on and from the date those rights came into being.
It must follow, therefore, that article 13(1) can have no retrospective effect but is wholly pro spective in its operation.
After this first point is noted, it should further be seen that article 13 (1) does not in terms make the existing laws which are inconsistent with the fundamental rights void ab initio or for all purposes.
On the contrary, it provides that all existing laws, in so far as they are inconsistent with the fundamental rights, shall be void to the extent of their inconsistency.
They are not void for all purposes but they are void only to the extent they come into conflict with the fundamental rights.
In other words, on and after the commencement of the Constitu tion no existing law will be permitted to stand in the way of the exercise of any of the fundamental rights.
Therefore, the voidness of the existing law is limited to the future exercise of the fundamental rights.
Article 13(1) cannot be read as obliterating the entire operation of the inconsist ent laws, or to wipe them out altogether from the statute book, for to do so will be to give them retrospective effect which, we have said, they do not possess.
Such laws exist for all past transactions and for enforcing all rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution.
Learned counsel for the appellant has drawn our attention to articles 249 (3), 250, 357, 358 235 and 369 where express provision has been made for saving things done under the laws which expired.
It will be no ticed that each of those articles was concerned with expiry of temporary statutes.
It is well known that on the expiry of a temporary statute no further proceedings can be taken under it, unless the statute itself saved pending proceed ings.
If therefore, an offence had been committed under a temporary statute and the proceedings were initiated but the offender had not been prosecuted and punished before the expiry of the statute, then, in the absence of any saving clause, the pending prosecution could not be proceeded with after the expiry of the statute by efflux of time.
It was on this principle that express provision was made in the several articles noted above for saving things done or omitted to be done under the expiring laws referred to therein.
As explained above, article 13 (1) is entirely prospective in its operation and as it was not intended to have any retrospective effect there was no necessity at all for inserting in that article any such saving clause.
The effect of article 13 (1) is quite different from the effect of the expiry of a temporary statute or the repeal of a statute by a. subsequent statute.
As already explained, article 13 (1) only has the effect of nullifying or rendering all inconsistent existing laws ineffectual or nugatory and devoid of any legal force or binding effect only with respect to the exercise of fundamental rights on and after the date of the commencement of the Constitution.
It has no retrospective effect and if, therefore, an act was done before the commencement of the Constitution in contra vention of the provisions of any law which, after the Con stitution, becomes void with respect to the exercise of any of the fundamental rights, the inconsistent law is not wiped out so far as the past act is concerned, for, to say that it is, will be to give the law retrospective effect.
There is No. fundamental right that a person shall not be prosecuted and punished for an offence committed before the Constitu tion came into force.
So far as the past acts 31 236 are concerned the law exists, notwithstanding that it does not exist with respect to the future exercise of fundamental rights.
We, therefore, agree with the conclusion arrived at by the High Court on the second question, although on dif ferent grounds.
In view of that conclusion, we do not consider it necessary to examine the reasons of the High Court for its conclusion.
In our opinion, therefore, this appeal fails, and is dismissed.
FAZL ALI J.
I regret that I cannot agree with the view which the majority of my colleagues are inclined to take in this case.
The facts of the case are simple and will bring out the point to be decided.
On the 9th December, 1949, the appel lant was arrested and a prosecution was started against him under section 18(1) of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act (XXIII of 1931) in the Court of the Chief Presidency Magistrate at Bombay for publishing a pamphlet in Urdu entitled ""Railway Mazdoorun Ke Khilaf Nai Sazish.
"" The prosecution case was that the pamphlet was a news sheet within the meaning of section 2(6) of the Act and that since it had been published without the authority required by section 1.5(1) of the Act, the appellant had committed an offence punishable under section 18(1) of the Act.
While the prosecution was pending, the Constitution of India came into force on the 26th January, 1950, and thereafter the appel lant raised the contention that sections 2(6), 15 and 18 of the Act were void, being inconsistent with article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution and therefore the case against him could not proceed.
Having raised this contention, the appellant filed a petition in the High Court at Bombay under article 228 of the Constitution asking the High Court to send for the record of the case and declare that sections 15 and 18of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act read with section 2(6) and (10) thereof were void and inoperative and the petitioner should be ordered to be acquitted.
The petition was heard by a Full Bench of the Bombay High Court, and the learned Judges constituting the Bench, in 237 deciding the point raised, assumed that the provisions of the Act impugned by the appellant were inconsistent with the fundamental right guaranteed by article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India, and held that article 13(1) had virtually the effect of repealing such provisions of existing laws as were inconsistent with any of the fundamental rights and that consequently under section 6 of the General Clauses Act, which is made applicable for the interpretation of the Constitution by article 367, pending proceedings were not affected.
The appellant 's petition to the High Court having been dismissed, he preferred this appeal in the Supreme Court.
One of the points discussed elaborately by the learned counsel appearing for the parties in the course of their arguments was as to what was the effect upon pending pro ceedings when an Act was repealed or when a temporary Act expired.
In Craies on Statute Law, the effect of the expiry of a temporary Act is stated to be as follows : ""As a general rule, and unless it contains some special provision to the contrary, after a temporary Act has expired no proceedings can be taken upon it, and it ceases to have any further effect.
Therefore, offences committed against temporary Acts must be prosecuted and punished before the Act expires, and as soon as the Act expires any proceedings which are being taken against a person will ipso facto terminate."" (4th Ed., pp. 347 348).
This statement of law by Craies was referred to with approval and adopted by the Federal Court in J.K. Gas Plant Manufacturing Co., (Rampur) Ltd., and Others vs King Emper or.
(1) As to the effect of the repeal of an Act, the fol lowing passage from Craies book seems to sum up the legal position as it obtained in England before the enactment of the Interpretation Act of 1889 : ""When an Act of Parliament is repealed,"" said Lord Tenterden in Surtees vs Ellison(2) ""it must be at 166.
(2) 238 considered (except as to transactions past and closed) as if it had never existed.
That is the general rule.
"" Tindal C.J. states the exception more widely.
He says (in Kay vs Goodwin)(1): ,, The effect of repealing a statute is to obliterate it as completely from the records of the Parlia ment as if it had never been passed;and it must be consid ered as a law that never existed except for the purpose of those actions which were commenced, prosecuted and concluded whilst it was an existing law."" (P. 350).
Again, Crawford in his book on ""Statutory Construction"" dealing with the general effect of the repeal of an Act states the law in America to be as follows: ' 'A repeal will generally, therefore, divest all incho ate rights which have arisen under the repealed statute, and destroy all accrued causes of action based thereon.
As a result, such a repeal, without a saving clause, will destroy any proceedings whether not yet begun, or whether pending at the time of the enactment of the repealing Act, and not already prosecuted to a final judgment so as to create a vested right."" (Pp.
599 600).
In a footnote relating to the cases which the learned author cites in support of the above proposition, he adds: ""See Cleveland, etc., R. Co. vs Mumford (Ind.)(2) where the repeal of a statute during the trial prevented a judg ment from being rendered.
Similarly, there can be no legal conviction for an offence, unless the act be contrary to law at the time it is committed; nor can there be a judgment, unless the law is in force at the time of the indictment and judgment.
If the law ceases to operate, by its own limita tion or by a repeal, at any time before judgment, no judg ment can be given.
Hence, it is usual in every repealing law to make it operate prospectively only, and to insert a a saving clause, preventing the retroactive operation of the repeal and continuing the repealed law in force as to all pending prosecutions, and often as to all violations of the existing law already committed."" (1) ; (2) 239 The author then proceeds to quote the following passage from Wall vs Chesapeake & Ohio Ry.
, Company (1): ""It is well settled that if a statute giving a special remedy is repealed without a saving clause in favour of pending suits all suits must stop where the repeal finds them.
If final relief has not been granted before the repeal went into effect, it cannot be after.
If a case is appealed, and pending the appeal the law is changed, the appellate court must dispose of the case under the law in force when its decision was rendered.
The effect of the repeal is to obliterate the statute repealed as completely as if it bad never been passed, and it must be considered as a law which never existed, except for the purposes of those actions or suits which were commenced, prosecuted and con cluded while it was an existing law.
Pending judicial pro ceedings based upon a statute cannot proceed after its repeal.
This rule holds true until the proceedings have reached a final judgment in the court of last resort, for that court, when it comes to announce its decision, conforms it to the law then existing, and may therefore reverse a judgment which was correct when pronounced in the subordi nate tribunal from whence the appeal was taken, if it ap pears that pending the appeal a statute which was necessary to support the judgment of the lower court has been with drawn by an absolute repeal."" (P. 601).
It is well known that formerly the practice in England used to be to insert in most of the repealing statutes a clause saving anything duly done or suffered under the repealed statutes and any pending legal proceeding or inves tigations.
Ultimately, to dispense with the necessity of having to insert a saving clause in almost every repealing Act, section 38 (2) was inserted in the Interpretation Act, 1889, which provides that a repeal, unless the con trary intention appears, does not affect the previous opera tion of the repealed enactment or anything duly done or suffered under it and any investigations, legal proceedings or (1) 125 N.E.20.
240 remedies may be instituted, continued or enforced in respect of rights, liabilities and penalties under the ;repealed Act, as if the repealing Act had not been passed.
Crawford in his book to which I have referred adverts in these words to a similar difficulty which was experienced in America and to the manner in which it has been met: ""Due to the numerous troublesome problems which constantly arose with the repeal of statutes, as well as to the numerous cases where hardship was caused, statutes have been enacted in several States expressly providing that the repeal of a statute shall not affect any rights, causes of action, penalties, forfeitures, and pending suits, accrued or instituted under the repealed statute."" In India, the earliest attempt that was made to guard against the normal legal effect of a repeal is to be found in section 6 of Act I of 1868.
This provision was further elaborated by section 6 of the General Clauses Act of 1897 which is on the same lines as section 38 (2)of the Interpre tation Act of England.
The position therefore now in India as well as in England is that a repeal has not the drastic effect which it used to have before the enactment of the Interpretation Act in England or the General Clauses Act in this country.
But this is due entirely to the fact that an express provision has been made in those enactments to counteract that effect.
Hence, in those cases which are not covered by the language of the General Clauses Act, the principle already enunciated will continue to operate.
The learned AttorneyGeneral had to concede that it was doubtful whether section 6 of that Act is applicable where there is a repeal by implication, and there can be no doubt that the law as to the effect of the expiry of a temporary statute still remains as stated in the books, because sec tion 6 of the General Clauses Act and section 38 (2) of the Interpretation Act have no application except where an Act is repealed.
It should be remembered 241 that the soundness of the law which has been consistently applied to cases governed by statutes which have ceased to be in force, by reason of having been repealed or having expired, has never been questioned, and it cannot be brushed aside as if it embodied some archaic or obsolete rule pecul iar only to the common law of England.
It is the law which has been enunciated by eminent Judges both in England and in America and is based on good sense and reason.
I shall now proceed to consider what would be the cor rect legal position, when a provision of an existing law is held to be void under article 13 (1) of the Constitution.
From the earlier proceedings before the Constituent Assem bly, it appears that in the original draft of the Constitu tion, the words ""shall stand abrogated"" were used instead of ""shall be void,"" in article 13 (1), and one of the questions directly before the Assembly was what would be the effect of the use of those words upon pending proceedings and anything duly done or suffered under the existing law.
Ultimately, the article emerged in the form in which it stands at present, and the words ""shall stand abrogated"" were replaced by the words ""shall be void.
"" If the words ""stand abrogated"" had been there, it would have been possible to argue that those words would have the same effect as repeal and would attract section 6 of the General Clauses Act, but those words have been abandoned and a very strong expression, indeed the strongest expression which could be used, has been used in their place.
The meaning of the word ""void"" is stated in Black 's Law Dictionary (3rd Edn.) to be as fol lows: ""null and void; ineffectual; nugatory; having no legal force or binding effect;unable in law to support the purpose for which it was intended; nugatory and ineffectual so that nothing can cure it; not valid.
"" A reference to the Constitution will show that the framers thereof have used the word ""repeal"" wherever neces sary (see articles 252, 254, 357, 372 and 395).
They have also used such words as ""invalid"" (see 242 articles 245, 255 and 276), ""cease to have effect"" (see articles 358 and 372), ' 'shall be inoperative"", etc.
They have used the word ""void"" only in two articles, these being article 13 (1) and article 154, and both these articles deal with cases where a certain law is repugnant to another law to which greater sanctity is attached.
It further appears that where they wanted to save things done or omitted to be done under the existing law, they have used apt language for the purpose; see for example articles 249, 250,357, 358 and 369.
The thoroughness and precision which the framers of the Constitution have observed in the matters to which reference has been made, disinclines me to read into article 13 (1) a saving provision of the kind which we are asked to read into it.
Nor can I be persuaded to hold that treating an Act as void under article 13 (1) should have a milder effect upon transactions not past and closed than the repeal of an Act or its expiry in due course of time.
In my opin ion, the strong sense in which the word ""void"" is normally used and the context in which it has been used are not to be completely ignored.
Evidently, the framers of the Constitu tion did not approve of the laws which are in conflict with the fundamental rights, and, in my judgment, it would not be giving full effect to their intention to hold that even after the Constitution has come into force, the laws which are inconsistent with the fundamental rights will continue to be treated as good and effectual laws in regard to cer tain matters, as if the Constitution had never been passed.
How such a meaning can be read into the words used in arti cle 13 (1), it is difficult for me to understand.
There can be no doubt that article 13 (1)will have no retrospective operation, and transactions which are past and closed, and rights which have already vested, will remain untouched.
But with regard to inchoate matters which were still not determined when the Constitution came into force, and as regards proceedings whether not yet begun, or pending at the time of the enforcement of the Constitution and not yet prosecuted to a final judgment, the very serious question arises as to whether a law which 243 has been declared by the Constitution to be completely ineffectual can yet be applied.
On principle and on good authority, the answer to this question would appear to me to be that the law having ceased to be effectual can no longer be applied.
In R. vs Mawgan (Inhabitants)(1) a presentment as to the non repair of a highway had been made under 13 Geo. 3, c. 78, section 24, but before the case came on to be tried, the Act was repealed.
In that case, Lord Denman C.J. said: ""If the question had related merely to the present ment, that no doubt is complete.
But dum loquimur, we have lost the power of giving effect to anything that takes place under that proceeding."" And Littledale J. added: ""/do not say that what is already done has become bad, but that no more can be done."" In my opinion, this is precisely the way in which we should deal with the present case.
It was argued at the Bar that the logical outcome of such a view would be to hold that all the convictions al ready recorded and all the transactions which are closed, should be reopened, but, in my opinion, to argue on these lines is to overlook what has been the accepted law for centuries, namely, that when a law is treated as dead, transactions which are past and closed cannot be revived and actions which were commenced, prosecuted and concluded whilst the law was operative cannot be reopened.
In the course of the arguments, a doubt was also raised as to what would be 'the effect in the case of an appeal pending when the Constitution came into force, from a con viction already recorded before the 26th January, 1950.
The law applicable to such a situation is well known and has been correctly summed up by Crawford in these words: ""Pending judicial proceedings based upon a statute cannot proceed after its repeal.
The rule holds true until the proceedings have reached a final judgment in the court of last resort, for that court, when it comes to announce its decision, conforms it to the law then existing, and may therefore reverse a judgment which was (1) ; 244 correct when pronounced in the subordinate tribunal from whence the appeal was taken, if it appears that pending the.
appeal a statute which was necessary to support the judgment of the lower court has been withdrawn by an abso lute repeal.
"" I think I should at this stage deal briefly with two points which were raised in the course of the arguments in support of the opposite view.
It was urged in the first place that without there being a saving clause to govern article 13 (1), it can be so construed as to permit offences committed prior to the 26th January, 1950, to be punished.
The argument has been put forward more or less in the fol lowing form.
The law which is said to be in conflict with the fundamental rights was a good law until the 25th January, and, since article 13 (1) is to be construed prospectively, and not retrospectively, every act constituting an offence under the old law remains an offence and can be punished even after the 26th January.
It seems to me that the same argument could be urged with reference to matters which constituted offences under a repealed Act or a temporary Act which has expired.
But such an argument has never succeeded.
The real question is wheth er a person who has not been convicted before the Act has ceased to exist or ceased to be effectual can still be prosecuted under such an Act.
The answer to this question has always been in the negative, and I do not see why a different answer should be given in the case of an Act which has be come void, i.e., which has become so ineffectual that it cannot be cured.
The second argument which also has failed to impress me is that if section 6 of the General Clauses Act does not in terms apply, the principle underlying that section should be applied.
The answer to this argument is that the Legislature in its wisdom has confined that section to a very definite situation, and, though it was open to it to make the section more comprehensive and general, it has not done so.
It is well known that situations similar to those which arise by reason of the repeal of an Act have arisen in regard to Acts 245 which have expired or Acts which have been declared to be void, and, though such situations must have been well known to the Legislature, they have not been provided for","Held by the Court (KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN, DAS and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ.
FAZL ALI and MUKHERJEA JJ., dissenting) Article 13(1) of the Indian Constitution does not make existing laws which are incon sistent with fundamental rights void ab initio, but only renders such laws ineffectual and void with respect to the exercise of fundamental rights on and after the date of the commencement of the Constitution.
It has no retrospective effect, and if therefore an act was done before the com mencement of the new Constitution in contravention of the provisions of any law which was a valid law at the time of the commission of the act, a prosecution for such an act, which was commenced before the Constitution came into force can be proceeded with and the accused punished according to that law.
even after the commencement of the new Constitu tion.
On the expiry of a temporary statute no further proceed ings can be taken under it unless the statute itself saved pending proceedings and if an offence had been committed under a temporary statute and proceedings were initiated but the offender had not been prosecuted and punished before the expiry of the statute, then in the absence of a saving clause the pending prosecution cannot be proceeded with after the expiry of the statute by efflux of time.
The effect of article 13(1) is quite different from that of the expiry of a temporary statute or the repeal of a statute by a subsequent statute.
A court of law has to gather the spirit of the Constitu tion from the language/of the Constitution.
What one may believe or wish to be the spirit of the Constitution cannot prevail if the language of the Constitution does not support that view.
229 Per FAZL ALI and MUKHERJEA JJ.
(contra) Though article 13(1) has no retrospective operation, and transactions which are past and closed and rights which have already vested will remain untouched, with regard to inchoate matters which were still not determined when the Constitution came into force, and as regards proceedings which were pending at the time of the enforcement of the Constitution and not yet prosecuted to a final judgment, a law which has become void under article 13(1) of the Constitution cannot be applied.
What has to be looked at is the state of the law at the time when the question arises as to whether a person has commit ted an offence, and if it is found that the law which made the act an offence has become completely ineffectual and nugatory, then neither can a charge be framed nor can the accused person be convicted.

February 5.
The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MAHAJAN J.
This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at.
Bombay modifying the decree of the trial court and decreeing partially the plaintiff 's suit.
The appellants are the legal representatives of the original plaintiff Haji Ali Mohamed Haji Cassum.
The State of Bombay is the respondent.
The facts giving rise to this Controversy, briefly stated, are as follows ; 35 268 Village Dahisar originally formed part of the Malad Estate comprising in all eight villages.
The said estate was conveyed by the East India Company to two Dady brothers for valuable consideration by a deed of indenture dated the 25th January, 1819.
By that conveyance all the lands in the eight villages were conveyed absolutely to the said purchas ers and it was covenanted by the Company that the purchas ers, their heirs and assigns shall peaceably and quietly enjoy the said villages and receive and take the rents and profits thereof without any hindrance or interruption from the said Company.
By a sale deed dated the 13th December, 1900, Haji Cassum, father of the plaintiff, purchased the village of Dahisar from its proprietors for a price of Rs. 1,30,000 and after his death the plaintiff became the pro prietor thereof and as such received rents and assessment from the tenants and holders of the lands in the village according to the rights prevailing under the survey settle ment which had taken place in the village about the year 1864 65.
In the year 1879 the Bombay Land Revenue Code was enact ed.
Section 48 of the Code is in these terms : ""48.
(1) The land revenue leviable on any land under the provisions of this Act shall be assessed, or shall be deemed to have been assessed, as the case may be, with reference to the use of the land (a) for the purpose of agriculture, (b) for the purpose of building, and (c) for a purpose other than agriculture or building.
(2) Where land assessed for use for any purpose is used for any other purpose, the assessment fixed under the provi sions of this Act upon such land shall, notwithstanding that the term for which such assessment may have been fixed has not expired, be liable to be altered and fixed at a differ ent rate by such authority and subject to such rules as the Provincial Government may prescribe in this behalf . . . "" 269 After the Act came into force, the Government drafted rules under the provisions of section 214 for promulgation.
The inamdars represented to the Government that the rules should be so framed as not to prejudice their rights under the conveyances executed by the Company in their favour.
The draft rules were promulgated by a notification issued on the 5th June, 1907.
On that date, the Government adopted a resolution ordering that the rules be promulgated and also giving an assurance to the inamdars to the following effect : ""Government will, however, be prepared to amend or abrogate these rules if they are found to be detrimental in any material respects to the interests of the inamdars.
"" Rule 92 is one of the rules promulgated under the provisions of the Act and it runs thus : ""When land assessed for purposes of agriculture only is subsequently used for any purpose unconnected with agricul ture the assessment upon the land so used shall, unless otherwise directed by Government, be altered under sub section (2) of section 48 by the collector in accordance with rules 81 to 87 inclusive."" On the 25th July, 1923, the plaintiff requested the Commissioner of Bombay, Suburban District, for a revision of the survey of Dahisar village.
He executed an agreement under the provisions of section 216 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code and made a formal application in that behalf as required by the Code and the rules made thereunder.
The Commissioner by his letter dated the 14th March, 1925, authorised the extension of the provisions of chapters 8 and 9 of the Land Revenue Code to the village in question.
The plaintiff also deposited the necessary expenses required for the revision of the survey.
The revision was made by the Superintendent of the Land Records who submitted his report to the Commissioner on the 15th December, 1926.
This report was sanctioned by Government.
The order sanctioning the revised survey was communicated to the plaintiff on the 23rd 270 December, 1927.
Under the revised survey the assessment of Rs. 4,217 on the village lands was increased to Rs. 6,057 3 2, and the plaintiff from that date started recover ing the increased assessment from the tenants of the lands in the village.
At the time of the revision of the survey it was found that nine plots of land comprised in eleven field numbers which were formerly agricultural had been built upon and these were being used for non agricultural purposes.
The survey officer formed them into a separate group and showed them as kharaba and no assessment, either agricultural or non agricultural, was levied on these nine plots and the plaintiff could not therefore recover any assessment in respect of these plots after 1926.
On the BOth April, 1934, he requested the Collector to assess non agricultural assessment on these plots.
This request was refused by the Collector on the 17th July, 1935, in these terms: ""With reference to your letter dated 30 4 1934, I have the honour to state that I regret your request cannot be granted.
"" It has to be observed that this refusal was in contra vention of the provisions of rule 92 which imposes on the Collector a duty to make alteration in the assessment, unless he has been directed to the contrary by Government.
It was not denied that by the 17th July, 1935, no such direction had been given to the Collector by Government.
If the Collector had done his duty as enjoined by rule 92, this lengthy and unnecessary litigation might well have been avoided.
Against the order of the Collector the plaintiff ap pealed to the Commissioner.
In his appeal he pointed out that certain additional lands in the village had been con verted to non agricultural uses subsequent to the revision of the survey in 1926.
The Commissioner declined to inter fere.
This information was conveyed by the Collector to the counsel for the plaintiff on the 22nd May, 1937.
Against the Commissioner 's decision, the plaintiff appealed to the Governor in Council and 271 on the 20th December, 1937, he received a copy of the fol lowing communication from Government to the Commissioner : ""The undersigned presents compliments to the Commis sioner, Northern Division, and with reference to his letter, No. L.N.D. 3124, dated 20th April, 1936, on the subject noted above, is directed to invite his attention, to the orders issued in Government Resolution, No. s235/3a, dated 8th March, 1937, and to state that Government confirm the action of the Collector, Bombay Suburban District, in refusing the Khot 's request for the levy of nonagricultural assessment in the village of Dahisar.
By order of the Governor in Council, for Under Secretary to the Government of Bombay.
"" In order to find out whether there was any resolution of the Government as mentioned in the above communication, during the pendency of the suit the plaintiff issued the following interrogatory to the Government of the State of Bombay : ""When was the decision, not to assess the lands men tioned in Schedule II of the plaint and other lands under rule 92, referred to in para.
8 of their written statement arrived at by the Government ? Produce a copy of the said decision which may have been embodied in a Government resolution along with the opinion of the Government officers with which Government may have concurred.
"" The answer given on behalf of the State Government to this question was as follows : ""(8) Government Memorandum, Revenue Department, No. 5235 B/33, dated the 8th March, 1937, confirmed the Collec tor 's action in refusing the proprietor 's request for the levy of non agricultural assessment. ' ' This answer indicates that the Government acting under rule 92, neither adopted any resolution nor issued any notification giving any directions to the Collector contrary to the provisions contained in that 272 rule.
All that it did was to confirm the Collector 's order rejecting the request of the plaintiff for making the as sessment of non agricultural lands in the village.
During the interval between 1927 37 a large number of plots of land mentioned in schedule II were put to non agricultural uses by the tenants in possession of them and a number of buildings were constructed thereupon.
The plain tiff having failed in persuading the Government to make an assessment under rule 92 of such lands, after service of notice under section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure, instituted the present suit, (a) for a declaration that he was entitled to have nonagricultural assessment made on all lands in the village of Dahisar which were used or which may thereafter be brought into use for purposes other than agricultural, and (b)for an order that the Collector of Bombay, Suburban District, be directed to determine the amount of non agricultural assessment on the lands mentioned in schedules I and II of the plaint and to levy the same under clause 2 of rule 96 and pay it to the plaintiff, or in the alternative, to direct the defendant to issue a commission to the plaintiff under section 88 of the Land Revenue Code.
Schedule I gave details of the nine plots of land that had been converted into non agricultural use before the survey of 1926, while schedule II gave details of those lands which since 1926 up to the date of the suit had been converted to such use.
The plaintiff also claimed damages to the extent of Rs. 120 as compensation for loss of agricultural assessment for six years in respect of lands mentioned in schedule I and he claimed similar damages to the extent of Rs. 300 for loss of non agricultural assess ment in respect of the other lands.
He also claimed future damages and costs.
The suit was resisted by the State Government on a number of grounds.
It was contended that it was barred under section 4 (c) of the Revenue Jurisdiction Act and under article 14 of the Indian Limitation Act.
On the merits it was pleaded that the action of the survey officer and the Collector in refusing to levy non agricultural assessment on lands contained in the 273 two schedules was lawful and proper and that the civil court could not question the discretion of the Government in such matters.
The trial Judge negatived all the technical objections raised by the defendant and on the merits held that the Collector 's action in refusing to levy nonagricultural assessment on the lands in question was wrongful.
He, there fore, granted the declaration prayed for.
He, however, refused to give further relief to the plaintiff and disal lowed the prayer for a direction for levying non agricultur al assessment on the lands given in the two schedules and for paying it to the plaintiff.
He observed that the Govern ment would be well advised if it levied such assessment and paid it to the plaintiff.
Two appeals were taken to the High Court against the decree of the trial Judge.
That Court modified this decree and granted a declaration to the plaintiff that he was entitled to receive non agricultural assessment on all lands which are and which may hereafter be used for non agricul tural purposes.
It ordered the defendant to levy such altered assessment on the lands mentioned in schedule I and decreed consequential damages to the plaintiff in respect to these lands.
As regards the lands in schedule II, the plain tiff 's suit for a direction to assess and levy non agricul tural assessment on them was dismissed.
The court drew a distinction between lands that had been converted to non agricultural use before the survey of 1926 and those which had since then been converted to such use.
As regards the former, it was held that the survey officer had erroneously declined to make non agricultural assessment on those lands and his action was ultra vires.
Relief was given to the plaintiff regarding those lands as prayed for.
As regards the latter, it was held that it was within the discretion of the Government to order an alteration of the assessment on such lands and this discretion could not be questioned in a court of law.
The plaintiff being dissatisfied with this part of the decision made an application for leave to appeal to.
the Privy Council on the 15th 274 September, 1945.
During the pendency of the application the plaintiff died and his heirs and executors were implead ed as his legal representatives.
A certificate for leave to appeal to the Privy Council was granted on the th February, 1947, and the appeal preferred under the certificate is now before us for decision.
There is no controversy in this appeal as regards the reliefs that have been given to the plaintiff by the High Court.
The appeal concerns the fur ther relief refused to the plaintiff in respect to the lands mentioned in schedule II.
It was contended on behalf of the appellant that under the terms of the conveyance dated 25th January, 1819, and of the covenants contained therein it was not open to the Government or the Collector to refuse the alteration of the assessment claimed by the plaintiff and that the Government could not give any direction under rule 92 which would be contrary to these covenants and assur ances.
It was said that the Government was bound to use its power to levy assessment as trustee for the transferee and that the exercise of this power could not be arbitrarily refused by it.
It was urged that the Government Resolution dated 5th June, 1907, clearly indicated that the rules framed under the Land Revenue Code were not intended to affect adversely the owners of alienated lands and the Collector was bound to make an assessment as required by the plaintiff.
Lastly, it was argued that as a matter of fact Government never exercised its power under rule 92 and never gave a direction to the Collector to a contrary effect and that the mere affirmation of the erroneous order of the Collector by Government did not amount to a direction con templated by the provisions of rule 92.
Having considered this case in all its aspects, we have reached the decision that the High Court 's decision have in so far as it refused relief to the plaintiff in respect to the lands mentioned in schedule II should be reversed.
Rule 92 cited in the earlier part of this judgment in imper ative terms directs the Collector to alter the assessment in case agricultural lands are Converted to non agricultural use.
The Collector has 275 no option in the matter and as soon as an application is made to him he should proceed to make an assessment and levy it on the non agricultural lands.
When the Collector de clined to accede to the request of the plaintiff he acted in contravention of the clear provisions of the rule, because admittedly at that time no ""directions to the contrary"" had been given to him by the Government.
There was no resolu tion of the Government in existence and no notification had been issued under the provisions of rule 92 directing the Collector not to make an alteration in the assessment when required to do so.
The Commissioner, in dismissing the plaintiff 's appeal, also contravened the provisions of rule 92.
When the matter went up in appeal to the Governor in Council, no decision was taken under the provisions of rule 92.
The High Court assumed that the confirmation of the action of the Collector by the Government amounted to a direction by the Government to the contrary in respect of the lands in question.
We are unable to agree with this conclusion.
When Gov ernment has been given the power to give directions to the Collector not to act in accordance with the imperative provisions of a rule which enjoin upon him to make the altered assessment, that power has to be exercised in clear and unambiguous terms as it affects civil rights of the persons concerned and the decision that the power has been exercised should be notified in the usual manner in which such decisions are made known to the public.
It was conceded by Mr. Joshi that no such decision was taken by Government and no direction was issued by Government under rule 92 Dismissal by the Government of the plaintiff 's appeal and affirmation by it of an erroneous order of the Collector could not be held to amount to action under the provisions of rule 92.
In these circumstances, the plaintiff was clearly entitled to further relief in respect to lands mentioned in schedule II and a direction should have been issued to the State Government for making altered assessment on non agricultural lands and levy it on them and pay it to the plaintiff.
36 276 Mr. Joshi contended that the true effect of the provi sions contained in section 48 (2) and rule 92 was that the Government was not bound to levy altered assessment on lands converted to non agricultural use, that the section merely provided that the persons in possession of land were liable for such assessment but it did not say that it was obligato ry on the Government to make it and that the court had no jurisdiction to interfere with the discretion of the Govern ment in the matter.
We think that when a liability is imposed by a statute, that liability cannot be defeated by the exercise of any discretion by Government or by making rules which may negative that liability, but it is not necessary in this case to finally decide the point as the appeal stands decided otherwise.
It is also unnecessary to express an opinion as to the precise scope of the power conferred on Government by the language of rule 92.
The plaintiff 's learned counsel very properly did not press his appeal in respect to the claim of damages concern ing lands mentioned in schedule II.
Plaintiff 's suit to that extent fails.
For the reasons given above the appeal is allowed and the plaintiff 's suit is decreed with costs except in regard to the claim for damages in respect to the lands mentioned in schedule II.
The defendant is directed to make an assess ment on lands mentioned in schedule II in the same way as in respect of the lands mentioned in schedule I and levy the same and pay it to the plaintiff.
Appeal allowed.
","Rule 92 of the rules issued under the Bombay Land Reve nue Code, 1879, provided that when land assessed for pur poses of agriculture only is subsequently used for any purpose unconnected with agriculture, the assessment upon the land so used shall unless otherwise directed by the Government be altered under section 48 (2) by the Collector in accordance with rr.
81 to 87: Held, that as the rule imposes an imperative duty on the Collector to alter the assessment, the power which has been given to the government to give directions to the Collector not to act in accordance with the imperative provisions of the rule has to be exercised in clear and unambiguous terms as it affects civil rights of the persons concerned and the decision that the power has been exercised must be notified in the usual manner.
Where the Government did not pass any resolution or issue any directions to that effect but merely confirmed on appeal an order of the Collector rejecting an application to assess nonagricultural assessment on agricultural lands which had been used for building purposes: Held, that the confirmation of the Collector 's order by the Government did not amount to a direction to act otherwise within the mean ing of r. 92 and the applicant was entitled to have the assessment on the lands altered under section 48(2) in accordance with rr.

February 2.
The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALL J.
This is an appeal from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Patna reversing the appellate decree of a Subordinate Judge in a suit insti tuted by the respondents.
The facts of the case are briefly these.
The respondents have been in occupation as a monthly tenant of several blocks of premises belonging to the appellants at a monthly rental of Rs. 112.
The rent for the months of March, April and May, 1942, having fallen into arrears, they remitted it along with the rent for June, on 28th June, 1947, by means of two cheques.
As the appellants did not accept the cheques, on 4th August, 1947, the re spondents remitted the amount subsequently by postal money order.
On 12th August, 1947, the appellants, maintaining that there was non payment of rent and hence the respond ents were liable to be evicted, under section 1 1 (1) (a) of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1947 (Bihar Act III of 1947), applied to the House Control ler for the eviction of the respondents from the premises.
Section 11 (1) (a) of the Act runs as follows : ""Notwithstanding anything contained in any agreement or law to the contrary and subject to the provisions of section 12, where a tenant is in possession of any building, he shall not be liable to be evicted therefrom, whether in execution of a decree or otherwise, except 147 (a) in the case of a month to month tenant, for non payment of rent or breach of the conditions of the tenancy, or for subletting the building or any portion thereof with out the consent of the landlord, or if he is an employee of the landlord occupying the building as an employee, on his ceasing to be in such employment ;"" On 30th August, 1947, the respondents, whose money order had in the meantime been returned by the appellants, deposited the rent up to the month of June in the Office of the House Controller.
Notwithstanding this deposit, the House Controller passed an order on the both November, directing the eviction of the respondents by 10th May, 1948, and holding that they had made themselves liable to eviction by reason ' of non payment of rent.
The order of the House Controller was upheld by the Commissioner on appeal on the 27th April, 1948, and thereupon the respondents filed the present suit in the Patna Munsif 's Court for a declaration that the order of the ContrOller dated the 10th November, 1947, was illegal, ultra vires and without jurisdiction.
The suit was dismissed by the Munsif and his decree was upheld on appeal, but the 'High Court decreed the suit holding that the order of the Rent Controller was without jurisdiction.
The appellants were thereafter granted leave to appeal by the High Court, and they have accordingly preferred this appeal.
The High Court has delivered a somewhat elaborate judg ment in the case, but it seems to us that the point ' aris ing in this appeal is a simple one.
The main ground on which the respondents have attacked the order of eviction passed by the House Controller is that in fact there was no non payment of rent, and, since no eviction can be ordered under the Bihar Act unless non payment is established, the House 'Controller had no jurisdiction to order eviction.
On the other hand, one of the contentions put forward on behalf of the appellants is that there was non payment of rent within the meaning of that expression as used in the Act, since the rent was not paid as and when it 148 fell due.
It was pointed out that the rent for the month of March became due in April and the rent for April became due in May, but no step was taken by the respondents to pay the arrears until the 28th June, 1947.
It appears that at the inception of the tenancy, the respondents had paid one month 's rent in advance, and it had been agreed between them and the appellants that the advance rent would be adjusted whenever there was default in payment of rent for full one month.
It was however pointed out that the advance payment could be adjusted only for one month 's rent, but, in the present case, the rent for three months had become due, and, since in a monthly tenancy the rent is payable for month to month, the rent for each month becoming due in the subse quent month, non payment of that rent at the proper time was sufficient to attract the provisions of section 11(1) (a) of the Act.
The appellants also raised a second contention, namely, that having regard to the scheme of the Act, the House Controller was fully competent to decide whether the condition precedent to eviction had been satisfied, anal once that decision had been arrived at, it could not be questioned in a civil court.
This contention was accepted by the first two courts, and the first appellate court dealing with it observed as follows : ""But the Buildings Control Act has authorised the Con troller to decide whether or not there is nonpayment of rent and it is only when he is satisfied that there has been nonpayment of rent that he assumes jurisdiction.
If the question of jurisdiction depends upon the decision of some fact or point of law, and if the court is called upon to decide such question, then such decision cannot be collater ally impeached (vide 12 Patna 117).
In my opinion when the Controller assumed the jurisdiction on being satisfied that there was non payment of rent and proceeded to pass an order of eviction.
I think the Civil Court can have no jurisdic tion to challenge the validity of such order.
"" The High Court did not however accept this view, and after referring to section 111 of the Transfer of 149 Property Act, proceeded to propound its own view in these words: ""Regard being had to the circumstances in which the Act under consideration was enacted and its object, as stated in the preamble as being 'to prevent unreasonable eviction of tenants ' from buildings, it would seem that the expres sion 'non payment of rent ' in section 11 in the context in which it is used must be given an interpretation which would have the effect of enlarging the protection against determi nation of a tenancy enjoyed by a tenant under the ordinary law.
The Legislature, therefore, by enacting that a tenant shall not be liable to be evicted 'except for nonpayment of rent ' should be held to have intended to protect a tenant from being evicted from a building in his possession for being a defaulter in payment of rent, if he brings into Court all the rent due from him before the order of his eviction comes to be passed .
If, as contended for on behalf of the respondents, section 11 of the Act were to be construed as entitling a landlord to apply for eviction of a tenant on the ground of irregular payment of rent amounting to ' non payment ' of rent and as empowering the Controller to determine as to whether irregular payment of rent amounts to non payment of rent within the meaning of sub section (1)of section 11, and subsection (3) of section 18 were to be construed as making the decision of the Controller on this question of law a final one, it will appear that not only this Act will have conferred a right upon the landlord very much in excess of the right that he enjoys under the ordinary law in the matter of determination of tenancies, but that it will have conferred very much larger power on the Controller than that possessed by the Civil Courts under the ordinary law in the matter of passing decrees for eviction of tenants.
The principle of law and equity on which relief against forfei ture for ',non payment of rent ' is based, will have been completely abrogated, and the protection of a tenant in possession of a building instead of being enlarged will 150 have been very much curtailed.
A construction of these provisions, which is calculated to bring about these conse quences, cannot and is not in accordance with the circum stances to which this Act was intended to apply and indeed cannot be accepted.
The contention of Mr. Lalnarain Sinha on behalf of the respondent that the circumstances disclosed in the petition raised the question for determination by the Controller whether a case of non payment of rent in law was established, and his decision of that question, even if wrong in law, is not liable to be questioned in the Civil Court must be over ruled.
"" It seems to us that the view taken by the High Court is not correct.
Section 11 begins with the words ""Notwithstand ing anything contained in any agreement or law to the con trary,"" and hence any attempt to import the provisions relating to the law of transfer of property for the inter pretation of the section would seem to be out of place.
Section 11 is a self contained section, and it is wholly unnecessary to go outside the Act for determining whether a tenant is liable to be evicted or not, and under what condi tions he can be evicted.
It clearly provides that a tenant is not liable to be evicted except on certain conditions, and one of the conditions laid down for the eviction of a month to month tenant is non payment of rent.
Sub section (8) (b) of section 11 provides that the ""Controller shall, if he is satisfied that the claim of the landlord is bona fide, make an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the building"" and if he is not so satisfied he shall make an order rejecting the application.
Section 16 empowers the Controller to make enquiries and inspections and to summon and enforce the attendance of witnesses and compel the production of documents in the same manner as is provided in the Code of Civil Procedure.
Section 18 pro vides that any person aggrieved by an order passed by the Controller may within 15 days of the receipt of such order by him, prefer an appeal to the Commissioner of the Divi sion, and it also prescribes the procedure for the hearing of the appeal.
Sub section (3) 151 of this section states that ""the decision of the Commission er and subject only to such decision, an order of the Con troller shall be final, and shall not be liable to be ques tioned in any Court of law whether in a suit or other pro ceeding by way of appeal or revision.
"" The Act thus sets up a complete machinery for the investigation of those matters upon which the jurisdiction of the Controller to order eviction of a tenant depends, and it expressly makes his order final and subject only to the decision of the Commis sioner.
The Act empowers the Controller alone to decide whether or not there is non payment of rent, and his deci sion on that question is essential before an order can be passed by him under section 11.
Such being the provisions of the Act we have to see whether it is at all possible to question the decision of the Controller on a matter which the Act clearly empowers him to decide.
The law on this subject has been very lucidly stated by Lord Esher M.R. in The Queen vs Commissioners for Special Purposes of the Income Tax(1), in these words : ""When an inferior court or tribunal or body, which has to exercise the power of deciding facts, is first estab lished by Act of Parliament, the legislature has to consider what powers it will give that tribunal or body.
It may in effect say that, if a certain state of facts exists and is shown to such tribunal or body before it proceeds to do certain things, it shall have jurisdiction to do such things, but not otherwise.
There it is not for them conclu sively to decide whether that state of facts exists, and, if they exercise the jurisdiction without its existence, what they do may be questioned, and it will be held that they have acted without jurisdiction.
But there is another state of things which may exist.
The legislature may intrust the tribunal or body with a jurisdiction, which includes the jurisdiction to determine whether the preliminary state of facts exists as well as the jurisdiction, on finding that it does exist, to proceed further or do (1) , at .319.
20 152 something more.
When the legislature are establishing such a tribunal or body with limited jurisdiction, they also have to consider, whatever jurisdiction they give them, whether there shall be any appeal from their decision, for otherwise there will be none.
In the second of the two cases I have mentioned it is an erroneous application of the formula to say that the tribunal cannot give themselves jurisdiction by wrongly deciding certain facts to exist, because the legis lature gave them jurisdiction to determine all the facts, including the existence of the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends; and if they were given jurisdiction so to decide without any appeal being given, there is no appeal from such exercise of their jurisdiction.
"" On the same lines are the following observations of Sir James Colville in The Colonial Bank of Australasia vs Wil lan(1), which is a case dealing with the principles on which a writ of certiorari may be issued : ""Accordingly, the authorities. establish that an adju dication by a Judge having jurisdiction over the subject matter is, if no defect appears on the face of it, to be taken as conclusive of the facts stated therein; and that the Court of Queen 's Bench will not on certiorari quash such an adjudication on the ground that any such fact, however essential, has been erroneously found.
"" There can be no doubt that the present case falls within the second category mentioned by Lord Esher, because here the Act has entrusted the Controller with a jurisdiction, which includes the jurisdiction to determine whether there is non payment of rent or not, as well as the jurisdiction, on finding that there is nonpayment of rent, to order evic tion of a tenant.
Therefore, even if the Controller may be assumed to have wrongly decided the question of non payment of rent, which by no means is clear, his order cannot be questioned in a civil court.
It seems to us that on this short ground this appeal must succeed, and we (1) , at p. 443.
153 accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and restore the decree of the courts below.
The appellants will be entitled to costs throughout.
Appeal allowed.
","Section 11 of the Bihar Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control Act, 1947, has entrusted the Controller with a jurisdiction, which includes the jurisdiction to determine whether there is non payment of rent or not, as well as the jurisdiction, on finding that there is non payment of rent, to order eviction of a tenant.
Therefore, even if a Controller has wrongly decided the question wheth er there has been non payment of rent, his order for evic tion on the ground that there has been non payment of rent cannot be questioned in a civil court.

27.txt,"Case No. 22 of 1950.
Appeal under article 132(1) of the Constitution against a judgment and order of the Bombay High Court dated 1st Sep tember, 1950, in Criminal Application No. 807 of 1950.
The facts and arguments of counsel are set out in the judgment.

The judgment of Kania C.J., Fazl Ali, Mukherjea and Chandrasekhara Aiyar JJ. was delivered by Kania C.J. Patanjali Sastri and Das JJ.
delivered separate judgments.
KANIA C.J. This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court at Bombay, ordering the release of the respondent who was detained in custody under a detention order made under the (IV of 1950).
The re spondent was first arrested on the 18th of December, 1948, under the Bombay 171 Public Security Measures Act, 1948 (Bombay Act IV of 1947), but was released on the 11th of November, 1949.
He was arrested again on the 21st of April, 1950, under the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950, and on the 29th of April, 1950`, grounds for his detention 'were supplied to him.
They were in the following terms: ""That you are engaged and are likely to be engaged in promoting acts of sabotage on railway and railway property in Greater Bombay.
"" The respondent filed a habeas corpus petition on the 31st of July, 1950, in which, after reciting his previous arrest and release, in para graphs 6 and 7 he mentioned as follows : ""(6) On his release the applicant left Bombay and stayed out of Bombay, that is, in Ratlam and in Delhi.
(7) On 20th April, 1950, he returned to Bombay and was immediately arrested as stated above."" He contended that the sole aim of the Government in ordering his detention was not the preservation of public order or the security of the State, but the locking up of active trade unionists who belonged to the All India Trade Union Congress.
He contended that the ground is ""delight fully vague and does not mention when, where or what kind of sabotage or how the applicant promoted it."" He further urged that the ground gave no particulars and therefore was not a ground as required to be furnished under the .
He stated that the present appellant acted mala fide, for a collateral purpose, outside the scope of the Act, and that the applicant 's detention in any event was illegal and mala fide.
When this petition was presented to the Court on the 9th of August, 1950, it directed the issue of a notice to the Commissioner of Police.
Pending the disposal of the Rule, on the 26th August, 1950, the Commissioner of Police sent a communication to the respond ent as follows: ""In pursuance of section 7 of the (Act IV of 1950), and in continuation of my commu nication No. 227 dated the 29th April, 172 1950, the following further particulars are hereby communi cated to you in connection with the grounds on which a detention order has been made against you under sub section (1) of section 3 of the said Act : That the activities mentioned in the grounds furnished to you were being carried on by you in Greater Bombay be tween January 1950 and the date of your detention; and In all probability you will continue to do so.
If, in view Of the particulars now supplied, you wish to make a further representation against the order under which you are detained, you should address it to the Government of Bombay and forward it through the Superintend ent of Arthur Road Prison, Bombay.
"" On the 30th of August, 1950, the Commissioner of Police filed an affidavit against the petition of the respondent in which it was stated that the objectionable activities were carried on by the applicant between the months of January, 1950, and the date of detention.
It further stated that in or about the month of January, 1950, there was a move for a total strike on the railways in India in the month of March, 1950, and the applicant was taking prominent part to see that the strike was brought ' about and was successful.
As a means to make the strike successful and bring about total cessation of work on all railways, the applicant and his associates were advocating sabotage on railways and railway property in Greater Bombay.
He further stated that reliable materials were put before him of the respondent being en gaged in such activities by experienced police officers.
He added that although the railways strike in the month of March did not materialise, the idea of bringing about such strike as soon as convenient continued to be entertained and the present respondent was actively engaged in bringing about such a strike in the near future.
He then stated that the disclosure of further facts relating to the activities of the detenue was against public interest.
In para.
6 there was a specific denial that 173 the respondent, after his release in November, 1949, and till 20th April, 1950, was out of Bombay.
It was stated that he used to go out of Bombay at times but during the major part of the period he was in the city of Bombay.
When the matter came up before a Bench of the High Court the respondent 's petition was granted.
In the judgment of the Court, Chagla C.J. observed: ""It is clear by reason of the view we have taken in several cases under section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code, that this is not a ground which would enable the detenue to make a representation to which he is entitled both under the Act and under the Constitu tion."" After noticing the affidavit of the Commisioner of Police, it was further observed: ""We appreciate the fact that, after our decision was given, Government decided to place all the materials before us so that we should be satisfied that what influenced the detaining authority in making the order was not any ulterior motive but that ample materials were at the disposal of the detaining authority which would justify the applicant 's detention.
We have looked at this affidavit and we have also looked at the particulars furnished to us by Mr. Chudasama.
If these particulars had been furnished at the time when the grounds were furnished on the 29th of April, 1950, very likely we would have come to the conclusion that the grounds were such as would have led the detenue to; know exactly what he was charged with and to make a proper representation.
"" The judgment is however based on the following observation of the Chief Justice: ""Anew and important question arises for our consideration; and that is whether it is permissible to the detaining authority to justify the detention by amplify ing and improving the grounds originally furnished . .
The only grounds which we have to consider and which were furnished in the purported compli ance of article 22(5) were the grounds furnished to the detenue on the 29th of April, 1950; and if these grounds were not such as to enable the detenue to make a proper representation, then there was a 174 violation of the fundamental right and a contravention of the statutory provisions.
That violation and that contra vention cannot be set right by the detaining authority by amplifying or improving the grounds already given.
As we said before, the point of time at which we have to decide whether there was a compliance or not with the provisions of article 22 (5) is the 29th of April, 1950, when the grounds were furnished, and not when further and better particulars were given on the 26th of August 1950.
"" The learned Attor ney General, appearing for the appellant, has strenuously objected to this line of approach.
As the question of vagueness of grounds for the order of detention and the question whether supplementary grounds could be furnished after the grounds were first given to the detenue have arisen in various High Courts, we think it right that the general principles should be properly appreciated.
The Constitution of India has given legisla tive powers to the States and the Central Government to pass laws permitting preventive detention.
In order that a legis lation permitting preventive detention may not be contended to be an infringement of the Fundamental Rights provided in Part III of the Constitution, article 22 lays down the permissible limits of legislation empowering preventive detention.
Article 22 prescribes the minimum procedure that must be included in any law permitting preventive detention and as and when such requirements are not observed the detention, even if valid an initio, ceases to be ""in accord ance with procedure established by law"" and infringes the fundamental right of the detenue guaranteed under articles 21 and 22 (s) of the Constitution.
In that way the subject of preventive detention has been brought into the chapter on Fundamental Rights.
In the 3resent case we are concerned only with clauses (5) and (6) of article 22 which run as follows: 22. ""(5) When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, 175 as soon as may be, communicate to such person the ground on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.
(6) Nothing in clause (5) shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose.
"" It has to be borne in mind that the legislation in question is not an emergency legislation.
The powers of preventive detention under this Act of 1950 are in addition to those contained in the Criminal Procedure Code, where preventive detention is followed by an inquiry or trial.
By its very nature, preventive detention is aimed at preventing the commission of an offence or preventing the detained person from achieving a certain end.
The authority making the order therefore cannot always be in possession of full detailed information when it passes the order and the infor mation in its possession may fall far short of legal proof of any specific offence, although it may be indicative of a strong probability of the impending commission of a prejudi cial act.
Section a of the there fore requires that the Central Government or the State Government must be satisfied with respect to any person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to (1) the defence of India, the relations of India with foreign powers, or the security of India, or (2) the security of the State or the maintenance of public order, or (8) the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community . . it is necessary So to do, make an order directing that such person be detained.
According to the wording of section 3 therefore before the Government can pass an order of preventive detention it must be satisfied with respect to the individual person that his activities are directed against one or other of the three objects mentioned in the section, and that the detaining authority was satisfied that it was necessary to prevent him from 23 176 acting in such a manner.
The wording of the section thus clearly shows that it is the satisfaction of the Central Government or the State Government on the point which alone is necessary to be established.
It is significant that while the objects intended to be defeated are mentioned, the different methods, acts or omissions by which that can be done are not mentioned, as it is not humanly possible to give such an exhaustive list.
The satisfaction of the Government however must be based on some grounds.
There can be no satisfaction if there are no grounds for the same.
There may be a divergence of opinion as to whether certain grounds are sufficient to bring about the satisfaction required by the section.
One person may think one way, another the other way.
If, therefore, the grounds on which it is stated that the Central Government or the State Gov ernment was satisfied are such as a rational human being can consider connected in some manner with the objects which were to be prevented from being attained, the question of satisfaction except on the ground of mala fides cannot be challenged in a court.
Whether in a particular case the grounds are sufficient or not, according to the opinion of any person or body other than the Central Government or the State Government, is ruled out by the wording of the sec tion.
It is not for the court to sit in the place of the Central Government or the State Government and try to deter mine if it would have came to the same conclusion as the Central or the State Government.
As has been generally observed, this is a matter for the subjective decision of the Government and that cannot be substituted by an objec tive test in a court of law.
Such detention orders are passed on information and materials which may not be strict ly admissible as evidence under the Evidence Act in a court, but which the law, taking into consideration the needs and exigencies of administration, has allowed to be considered sufficient for the subjective decision of the Government.
An order having been so permitted to be made, the next step to be considered is, has the detained person 177 any say in the matter? In the chapter on Fundamental Rights, the Constitution of India, having given every citizen a right of freedom of movement, speech, etc. with their relative limitations prescribed in the different articles in Part III, has considered the position of a person detained under an order made under a .
Three things are expressly considered.
in article 22 (5) it is first considered that the man so detained has a right to be given as soon as may be the grounds on which the order has been made.
He may otherwise remain in custody without having the least idea as to why his liberty has been taken away.
This is considered an elementary right in a free democratic State.
Having received the grounds for the order of deten tion, the next point which is considered is, ""but that is not enough; what is the good of the man merely knowing grounds for his detention if he cannot take steps to redress a wrong which he thinks has been committed either in belief in the grounds or in making the order."" The clause therefore further provides that the detained person should have the earliest opportunity making a representation against the order.
The representation has to be against the order of detention because the grounds are only steps for the satis faction of the Government on which satisfaction the order of detention has been made.
The third thing provided is in clause (6).
It appears to have been thought that in convey ing the information to the detained person there may be facts which cannot be disclosed in the public interest.
The authorities are therefore left with a discretion in that connection under clause (6).
The grounds which form the basis of satisfaction when formulated are bound to contain certain facts, but mostly they are themselves deductions of facts from facts.
That is the general structure of article 22, clauses (5) and (6), of the Constitution.
The question arising for discussion is what should be stated in the grounds.
It is argued that whatever may be stated or omitted to be stated, the ground cannot be vague;that the Constitution envisages the 178 furnishing of the grounds once and therefore there is no occasion for furnishing particulars or supplemental grounds at a later stage; and that article 22 (5) does not give the detained person a right to ask for particulars, nor does it give the authorities any right to supplement the grounds, once they have furnished the same.
In our opinion much of the controversy is based on a somewhat loose appreciation of the meaning of the words used in the discussion.
We think that the position will be clarified if it is appreciated in the first instance what are the rights given by article 22 (5). 'The first part of article 22, clause (5), gives a right to the detained person to be furnished with ""the grounds on which the order has been made"" and that has to be done ""as soon as may be."" The second right given to such persons is of being afforded ""the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.
"" It is obvious that the grounds for making the order as mentioned above, are the grounds on which the detaining authority was satis fied that it was necessary to make the order.
These grounds therefore must be in existence when the order is made.
By their very nature the grounds are conclusions of facts and not a complete detailed recital of all the facts.
The con clusions drawn from the available facts will show in which of the three categories of prejudicial acts the suspected activity of the particular person is considered to fall, These conclusions are the ""grounds"" and they must be sup plied.
No part of such ""grounds"" can be held back nor can any more ""grounds"" be added thereto.
What must be supplied are the ""grounds on which the order has been made"" and nothing less.
The second right of being afforded the ""earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order"" is not confined to only a physical opportunity by supplying paper and pen only.
In order that a representa tion can be made the person detained must first have knowl edge of the grounds on which the authorities conveyed that they were satisfied about the necessity of making the detention order.
It is therefore clear that if the repre sentation has to be intelligible to meet the charges 179 contained in the grounds, the information conveyed to the detained person must be sufficient to attain that object.
Ordinarily, the ""grounds"" in the sense of conclusions drawn by the authorities will indicate the kind of prejudicial act the detenue is suspected of being engaged in and that will be sufficient to enable him to make a representation setting out his innocent activities to dispel the suspicion against him.
Of course if the detenue is told about the details of facts besides the grounds he will certainly be in a better position to deal with the same.
It is significant that the clause does not say that the ""grounds"" as well as details of facts on which ' they are based must be furnished or fur nished at one time.
The law does not prescribe within what time after the grounds are furnished the representation could be made.
The time in each case appears deliberately unprovided for expressly, because 'circumstances vary in each case and make it impossible to fix a particular time for the exercise of each of these two rights.
It thus appears clear that although both these rights are separate and are to be exercised at different times, they are still connected with each other.
Without getting information sufficient to make a representation against the order of detention it is not possible for the man to make the representation.
Indeed the right will be only illusory but not a real right at all.
The right to receive the grounds is independent but it is thus intentionally bound up and connected with the right to make the representation.
Although these two rights are thus linked up, the contingen cy of further communication between the furnishing of the grounds on which the order is made and the exercise of the right of representation granted by the second part of that clause is not altogether excluded.
, One thing is clear from the wording of this clause and that is that after the grounds are once conveyed to the detenue there can be no addition to the grounds.
The grounds being the heads, from which the Government was satisfied that it was necessary to pass the order of detention, there can be no addition to those 180 grounds because such additional grounds will be either the grounds which were not elements to bring about the satisfac tion of the Government or if they were such grounds there has been a breach of the provision of the first part of article 22 (5), as those grounds for the order of detention were not conveyed to the detained person ""as soon as may be.
"" This however does not mean that all facts leading to the conclusion mentioned in the grounds must be conveyed to the detained person at the same time the grounds are conveyed to him.
The facts on which the conclusion mentioned in the grounds are based must be available to the Government, but there may be cases where there is delay or difficulty in collecting the exact data or it may not be convenient to set out all the facts in the first communication.
If the sec ond ' communication contains no further conclusion of fact from facts, but only furnishes all or some of the facts on which the first mentioned conclusion was rounded it is obvious that no fresh ground for which the order of detention was made is being furnished to the detained person by the second communication which follows some time after the first communication.
As regards the contents of that communication therefore he test appears to be whether what is conveyed in the second communication is a statement of facts or vents, which facts or events were already taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion included in the ground already supplied.
If the later communication contains facts leading to a conclusion which is outside the ground first supplied, the same cannot be looked into as supporting the order of detention and therefore those grounds are ""new"" grounds.
In our opinion that is the more appropriate expression to be used.
The expression ""addi tional grounds"" seems likely to lead to confusion of thought.
The next point to be considered is the time factor.
if a second communication becomes necessary, when should it be made ? Clause 22 (5) lays down two time factors.
The first is that the grounds should be supplied ""as soon as may be "" This allows the 181 authorities reasonable time to formulate the grounds on the materials in their possession.
The time element is neces sarily left indeterminate because activities of individuals tending to bring about a certain result may be spread over a long or a short period, or a larger or a smaller area, or may be in connection with a few or numerous individuals.
The time required to formulate the proper grounds of deten tion, on information received, is bound to vary in individu al cases.
There is no doubt that no express words are used to suggest a second communication from the authority to the detained person.
But having regard to the structure of the clause dealing with the two rights connected by the word ""and "", and the use of the words ""as soon as may be"" and ""earliest opportunity"" separately, indicating two distinct time factors, one in respect of the furnishing of grounds and the other in respect of the making of the representa tion, the contingency of a second communication after the grounds are furnished, is not excluded.
However, the second communication should not be liable to be charged as not being within the measure ""as soon as may be "".
Secondly, it must not create a new ground on which satisfaction of the Government could be suggested to have been arrived at.
In our opinion, if these two conditions are fulfilled, the objection against a later communication of details or facts is not sufficient to cause an infringement of the provision made in article 22(5).
The question has to be approached from another point of view also.
As mentioned above, the object of furnishing grounds for the order of detention is to enable the detenue to make a representation, i.e., to give him an opportunity to put forth his objections against the order of detention.
Moreover, ""the earliest opportuni ty"" has to be given to him to do that.
While the grounds of detention are thus the main factors on which the subjective decision of the Government is based, other materials on which the conclusions in the grounds are rounded could and should equally be conveyed to the detained person to enable him to make out his objections against the 182 order.
To put ,it in other words, the detaining authority has made its decision and passed its order.
The detained person is then given an opportunity to urge his objections which in cases of preventive detention comes always at a later stage.
The grounds may have been considered suffi cient by the Government to pass its judgment.
But to enable the detained person to make his representation against the order, further details may be furnished to him.
In our opinion, this appears to be the true measure of the proce dural rights of the detained person under article 22 (5).
It was argued that under article 22 (6) the authorities are permitted to withhold facts which they consider not desirable to be disclosed in the public interest.
It was argued that therefore all other facts must be disclosed.
In our opinion that is not the necessary conclusion from the wording of article 22 (6).
It gives a right to the detaining authority not to disclose such facts, but from that it does not follow that what is not stated or considered to be withheld on that ground must be disclosed and if not dis closed, there is a breach of a fundamental right.
A wide latitude is left to the authorities in the matter of disclo sure.
They are given a special privilege in respect of facts which are considered not desirable to be disclosed in public interest.
As regards the rest, their duty is to disclose facts so as to give the detained person the earliest oppor tunity to make a representation against the order of deten tion.
On behalf of the respondent, it was argued that if the grounds of detention are vague or insufficiently clear there will result a failure to give him the earliest opportunity to make a representation against the order of detention and that defect in its turn must affect the satisfaction on which the order of detention was made.
It was argued that just as a ground which is completely irrelevant, and there fore, in law is no ground at all, could not satisfy any rational person about the necessity for the order, a vague ground 183 which is insufficient to enable the detenue to make a repre sentation would similarly make the order of detention based on it, void.
In our opinion, this argument is un sound.
Although the ground may be good there may be a certain indefiniteness in its statement.
Proceeding on the footing that there is some connection, i.e., the ground by itself is not so convincingly irrelevant and incapable of bringing about satisfaction in any rational person, the question whether such ground can give rise to the satisfac tion required for making the order is outside the scope of the inquiry of the court.
On the other hand, the question whether the vagueness or indefinite nature of the statements furnished to the detained person is such as to give him the earliest opportunity to make a representation to the author ity is a matter within the jurisdiction of the court 's inquiry and subject to the court 's decision.
The analogy sought to be drawn between a ground which can have no connection whatsoever with the order and a ground which on its face has connection with the order but is not definite in its statement, is clearly faulty.
The extreme position, on the other hand, that there is no connection between the ground to be furnished and the representation to be made by the detained person under article 22 (5) is equally unsound, when the object in furnishing the ground is kept in mind.
The conferment of the right to make a representation necessarily carries with it the obligation on the part of the detaining authority to furnish the grounds, i.e., materials on which the detention order was made.
In our opinion, it is therefore clear that while there is a connec tion between the obligation on the part of the detaining authority to furnish grounds and the right given to the detained person to have an earliest opportunity to make the representation, the test to be applied in respect of the contents of the grounds for the two purposes is quite dif ferent.
As already pointed out, for the first, the test is whether it is sufficient to satisfy the authority.
For the second, the test is, 24 184 whether it is sufficient to enable the detained person to make the representation at the earliest opportunity.
The argument advanced on behalf of the respondent mixes up the two rights given under article 22 (5) and converts it into one indivisible right.
We are unable to read article 22 (5) in that way.
As pointed out above, the two rights are connected by the word ""and"".
Furthermore, the use of the words ""as soon as may be"" with the obligation to furnish the grounds of the order of detention, and the fixing of another time limit, viz. the earliest opportunity, for making the representation, makes the two rights distinct.
The second right, as it is a right of objection, has to depend first on the service of the grounds on which the conclusion, i.e., satisfaction of the Government about the necessity of making the order, is based.
To that extent, and that extent alone, the two are connected.
But when grounds which have a ration al connection with the ends mentioned in section a of the Act are supplied, the first condition is satisfied.
If the grounds are not sufficient to enable the detenue to make a representation, the detenue can rely on his second right and if he likes may ask for particulars which will enable him to make the representation.
On an infringement of either of these two rights the detained person has a right to approach the court and complain that there has been an infringement of his fundamental right and even if the infringement of the second part of the right under article 22 (5) is established he is bound to be released by the court.
To treat the two rights mentioned in article 22 (s) as one is neither proper according to the language used, nor according to the purpose for which the rights are given.
The contention that the grounds are vague requires some clarification.
What is meant by vague ? Vague can be considered as the antonym of 'definite '.
If the ground which is supplied is incapable of being understood or de fined with sufficient certainty it can be called vague.
It is not possible to state affirmatively more on the question of what is vague.
It must vary according to the circum stances of each case.
It is 185 however improper to contend that a ground is necessarily vague if the only answer of the detained person can be to deny it.
That is a matter of detail which has to be examined in the light of the circumstances of each case.
If on reading the ground furnished it is capable of being intel ligently understood and is sufficiently definite to furnish materials to enable the detained person to make a represen tation against the order of detention it cannot be called vague.
The only argument which could be urged is that the language used in specifying the ground is so general that it does not permit the detained person to legitimately meet the charge against him because the only answer which he can make is to say that he did not act as generally suggested.
In certain cases that argument may support the contention that having regard to the general language used in the ground he has not been given the earliest opportunity to make a repre sentation against the order of detention.
It cannot be disputed that the representation mentioned in the second part of article 22 (5) must be one which on being considered may give relief to the detained person.
The argument that supplementary grounds cannot be given after the grounds are first given to the detenue, similarly requires a closer examination.
The adjective ""supplemen tary"" is capable of covering cases of adding new grounds to the original grounds, as also giving particulars of the facts which are already mentioned, or of giving facts in addition to the facts mentioned in the ground to lead to the conclusion of fact contained in the ground originally fur nished.
It is clear that if by ""supplementary grounds"" is meant additional grounds, i.e., conclusions of fact required to bring about the satisfaction of the Government, the furnishing of any such additional grounds at a later stage will amount to an infringement of the first mentioned right in article 22 (5) as the grounds for the order of detention must be before the Government before it is satisfied about the necessity for making the order and all such grounds have to be furnished 186 as soon as may be.
The other aspects, viz., the second communication (described as supplemental grounds) being only particulars of the facts mentioned or indicated in the grounds first supplied, or being additional incidents which taken along with the facts ment","The respondent was arrested on the 21st of April, 1950, under the , and on the 29th of 168 April.
1950, he was supplied with the ground for his deten tion which was as follows: ""That you are engaged and are likely to be engaged in promoting acts of sabotage on rail way and railway property in Greater Bombay.
"" The respondent filed a habeas corpus petition contending that the ground supplied was vague as it did not mention the time, place or nature of the sabotage or how the respondent promoted it and that as the ground gave no particulars, his detention was illegal.
Pending the disposal of the petition, the Commis sioner of Police sent a communication to the respondent giving these further particulars, viz., that the activities mentioned in the grounds supplied to him were being carried on by him in Greater Bombay between January, 1950, and the date of his detention and that he will in all probability continue to do so.
The High Court of Bombay held that if these particulars had been furnished at the time when the grounds were furnished on the 29th of April, 1950, very likely they would have come to the conclusion that the grounds were such as would have led the detenue to know exactly what he was charged with and to make a proper repre sentation, but released the respondent holding that the only grounds which were furnished in the purported compliance of article 22 (5) were the grounds furnished on the 29th of April, 1950, and as these grounds were not such as to enable the detenue to make a proper representation, there was a viola tion of a fundamental right and a contravention of the statutory provisions and this violation cannot be set right by the detaining authority by amplifying or improving the grounds already given: Held by the Full Court (KANIA C.J., FAZL ALI, PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA, DAS and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ).
Under section 3 of the , it is the satis faction of the Central Government or the State Government, as the case may be, that is necessary, and if the grounds on which it is stated that the Central Government or the State Government are satisfied have a rational connection with the objects which were to be prevented from being attained, the question of satisfaction cannot be challenged in a court of law except on the ground of mala fides.
Held also per KANIA C.J., FAZL ALI, MUKHERJEA and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ.
, (PATANJALI SASTRI and DAS JJ.
dissenting).
Clause (5)of article 22 confers two rights on the detenue, namely, first, a right to be informed of the grounds on which the order of detention has been made, and secondly, to be afforded the earliest opportunity to make a representation against the order; and though these rights are linked together, they are two distinct rights.
If grounds which have a rational connection with the objects mentioned in section 3 are supplied, the first condition is complied with.
But the ,right to make a representation implies that the detenue should have information so as to enable him to make a representation, and if the grounds 169 supplied are not sufficient to enable the detenue to make a representation, he can rely on the second right.
He may if he likes ask for further particulars which will enable him to make a representation.
On an infringement of either of these two rights the detained person has a right to approach the court, and even if an infringement of the second right under article 22 (S) is alone, established he is entitled to be released.
Per PATANJALI SASTRI and DAS JJ.
As the power to issue a detention order depends upon the existence of a state of mind in the detaining authority, that is, its satisfaction, which is purely a subjective condition and judicial enquiry into the sufficiency of the grounds to justify the detention is thus excluded, it would be wholly inconsistent with the scheme to hold that it is open to the court to examine the sufficiency of the same grounds to enable the person de tained to make a representation, for, the grounds to be communicated to the person detained are the grounds on which the order has been made.
There is further nothing in article 22, el.
(5), to warrant the view that the grounds on which the order of detention has been made must be such, that when communicated to the person they are found by a court of law to be sufficient to enable him to make what the court con siders to be an adequate representation, or that the latter part of cl.
(5) confers a distinct right on the detenue or an independent obligation on the detaining authority to furnish the detenue with sufficient particulars and details to enable him to make an effective representation.
Held by the Full Court (KANIA C.J., FAZL ALI, PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA, DAS and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ.) In any view, on the facts of the case there was no infringement of any fundamental right of the respondent or contravention of any constitutional provision as he had been supplied with sufficient particulars as soon as he raised the objection that the grounds supplied were vague and the respondent was not, therefore, entitled to be released.
Per KANIA C.J., FAZL ALI, MUKHERJEA and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ.) The ""grounds"" for making the order which have to be communicated to the person detained as soon as may be are conclusions of facts and not a complete recital of all the facts.
These grounds must be in existence when the order is made.
No part of the 'grounds can be held back, and after they have been once conveyed there can be no addition to the grounds.
All facts leading to the conclusion constituting the ground need not, however, be conveyed at the same time.
If a second communication contains no further conclusion of fact but only furnishes some of the facts on which the first mentioned conclusion was rounded it does not amount to a fresh ground.
The test therefore is whether what is conveyed in the second communication is a statement of facts or events, which facts or 170 events were already taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion constituting the ground already supplied.
So long as the later communications do not make out a new ground, their contents are no infringement of the two procedural rights of the detenue mentioned in article 22, cl.
They may consist of a narration of facts or particulars relating to the grounds already supplied.
But in doing so the time factor in respect of second duty, viz., to give the detained person the earliest opportunity to make a represen tation, cannot be overlooked.
If on reading the ground furnished it is capable of being intelligently understood and is sufficiently definite to furnish materials to enable the detained person to make a representation against the order it cannot be said to be ""vague.
"" The question whether the vagueness or indefinite nature of the statement furnished to the detained person is such that he was not given the earliest opportunity to make a representation is a matter within the jurisdiction of the court 's inquiry and subject to the court 's decision.

Appeal from the judgment of the Calcutta High Court (Harries C.J. and Chakravarthi J.) in Appeal from Original Order No. 78 of 1948.
N.C. Chatterjee (B. Sen, with him), for the appellants.
A.N. Grover, for the respondents.
November 30.
The judgment of Fazl Ali and Patanja li Sastri JJ. was delivered by FAZL ALI J.
This is an appeal from a judgment of a Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta in West Bengal, reversing the decision of a single Judge of that Court, who had refused to set aside an award given by the arbitration tribunal of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce on a submission made by the respondents.
The facts of the case are as follows.
On the 25th January, 1946, the appellants entered into a contract with the respondents for the sale of 5,000 mounds of jute, which was evidenced by a ""sold note"" (Exhibit A), which is in the form of a letter addressed to the respond ents, commencing with these words: ""We have this day sold by your order and for your account to the undersigned, etc.
"" The word ""undersigned"" admittedly refers to the appellants, and, at the end of the contract, below their signature, the word ""brokers"" is written.
On the same day, a ""bought note"" (Exhibit B) was addressed by the appellants to the Bengal Jute Mill Company, with the following statement: ""We have this day bought by your order and.
for your account from the undersigned, 794 etc.
"" In this note also, the word ""undersigned"" refers to the appellants and underneath their signature, the word ""brokers"" appears, as in the ""sold note"" There are various provisions in the sold note, relating to delivery of jute, non delivery of documents, nonacceptance of documents, claims, etc., but the most material provisions are to be found in paragraphs 10 and 11.
paragraph 10 provides that the sellers may in certain cases be granted an extension of time for delivering the jute for a period not exceeding thirty days from the due date free of all penalties, and if the contract is not implemented within the extended peri od, the buyers would be entitled to several options, one of them being to cancel the contract and charge the sellers the difference between the contract rate and the market rate on the day on which the option is declared.
In the same para graph, there is another provision to the following effect: ""Sellers shall notify Buyers that goods will or will not be shipped within such extended period referred to in (a) and in the case of sellers intimating that they will be unable to ship within the extended time Buyers shall exercise their option within 5 working days of receiving notice and notify Sellers.
In the absence of any such notice from Sellers it shall be deemed that the goods have not been shipped and Buyers shall exercise their option within 5 working days after expiration of extended date and notify Sellers.
"" The 11th paragraph provides among other things that ""all matters, questions, disputes, differences and/or claims arising out of and/or concerning and/or in connection and/or in consequence of or relating to this Contract whether or not obligations of either or both parties under this contract be subsisting at the time of such disputes and whether or not this contract has been terminated or purport ed to be terminated or completed shall be referred to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce under the rules of its Tribunal of Arbitration for the time being in force and according to such rules the arbitration shall be conducted.
"" 795 It is common ground that the respondents delivered 2,256 maunds of jute under the contract, but the balance of 2,744 maunds could not be delivered within the stipulated period, and, by mutual agreement, time was extended up to the 30th June, 1946.
On the 2nd July, 1946, the respondents addressed a letter to the appellants stating that the balance of jute could not be despatched owing to lack of wagons, and ""exten sion"" was requested for a period of one month.
In reply to this letter, which was received by the appellants on or about the 3rd July, 1946, time was extended till the 31st July, 1946.
On the same day on which the reply was received by the respondents, i.e., on the 9th July, 1946, they ad dressed a letter to the appellants pointing out that the extension of time had not been intimated within the 5th working day as provided in the contract and therefore the contract was automatically cancelled.
After this letter, some further correspondence followed between the two par ties, and finally a bill of difference amounting to Rs. 4,116 was submitted by the appellants to the respondents, who, in their turn, denied their liability to pay the sum.
The appellants thereupon claimed arbitration under clause 11 of the sold note and submitted the dispute between them and the respondents to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce.
On the 6th February, 1947, the Tribunal of Arbitration made an award to the effect that the due date of contract had been extended by mutual agreement up to the 31st July, 1946, and accordingly the respondents should pay to the appellants a sum of Rs. 4,116 together with interest at the rate of 4% per annum from the 10th August, 1946, until the date of the award.
A sum of Rs. 210 was also held to be payable by the respondents on account of costs.
Nearly a year later, on the 19th February, 1949, a petition was presented by the re spondents under the Indian , to the High Court at Calcutta, in its ordinary original civil jurisdiction, praying inter alia that the award may be adjudged to be without jurisdiction and void and not binding on the respondents, and that it may be set aside.
The main point raised by the 796 respondents in the petition was that it was not open to the appellants to invoke the arbitration clause, as the Bengal Jute Mill Company and not the appellants were the real party to the contract and the appellants had acted as mere bro kers.
The appellants asserted in reply that the allegation made by the respondents in regard to there being no privity between them and the appellants was wrong, and in paragraph 16 of their affidavit they stated as follows : ""With regard to paragraph 7 of the petition I crave reference to the said contract for its true construction and effect.
I say as I have already stated that according to the custom or usage or practice of the trade the respondent is entitled to charge brokerage and also to enforce the terms of the said contract.
"" The case was heard by Sinha J., who dismissed the peti tion on the ground that the contract was directly between the respondents and the appellants.
The learned Judge also observed that if the right of the appellants to enforce the contract depended upon the existence of custom it would have been necessary to take evidence and the arbitrators would have had jurisdiction to decide the question of the exist ence of custom.
The respondents being dissatisfied with the judgment of Sinha J., preferred an appeal, which was heard and disposed of by a Division Bench of the High Court consisting of the learned Chief Justice and Chakravarthi J.
The learned Judges held that having regard to the fact that the appellants ' own contention was that they had entered into the contract as brokers and were entitled to enforce its terms by reason of the usage or custom of the trade, it was not open to Sinha J. to treat them as principals, and the award was liable to be set aside on the ground that the arbitration tribunal had no jurisdiction to make an award at the instance of a per son who was not a principal party to the contract.
The appellants thereafter having obtained a certificate from the High Court under section 109 (c) of the Code of Civil Proce dure, preferred this appeal.
797 It seems to us that this appeal can be disposed of on a short ground.
We have carefully read the affidavit filed on behalf of the appellants in the trial court, and we are unable to hold that their case was that they were not par ties to the contract or that they had asked the court to proceed on the sole ground that they were entitled to en force the contract by virtue of the custom or usage of the trade.
In our opinion, the position which was taken up by them may be summed up as follows : (1) They did not accept the allegations made by the respond ents that they were not parties to any arbitration agreement with the respondents.
(2) They asked the Court to construe the contract and its effect and asserted that they were entitled to enforce it.
(3) They also stated that they were entitled to enforce the contract according to the custom or usage of the trade.
The principal dispute raised in this case was whether the extension of time for delivery was granted within the time limited in the contract.
That dispute is certainly covered by the arbitration clause.
The further dispute that the brokers (appellants) were not parties to the contract in their own right as principals but entered into the contract only on behalf of the Bengal Jute Mill Company does not appear to have been raised until the matter went to the arbitrators.
Assuming that at that stage it was open to the respondents to raise such an objection, after the other dispute which clearly fell within the arbitration clause was referred to the arbitrators, this further dispute is also one which turns upon the true interpretation of the con tract, so that the respondents must have recourse to the contract to establish their claim that the appellants were not bound as principals while the latter say that they were: If that is the position, such a dispute, the determination of which turns on the true construction of the contract, would also seem to be a dispute, under or arising out of or concerning the contract.
In a 798 passage quoted in Heyman vs Darwins Ltd.(1), Lord Dunedin propounds the test thus: "" If a party has to have recourse to the contract, that dispute is a dispute under the con tract "".
Here, the respondents must have recourse to the contract to establish their case and therefore it is a dispute falling within the arbitration clause.
The error into which the learned Judges of the appellate Bench of the High Court appear to have fallen was their regarding the dispute raised by the respondent in respect of the position of the appellants under the contract as having the same consequence as a dispute as to the contract ever having been entered into.
If, therefore, we come to the conclusion that both the disputes raised by the respondents fail within the scope of the arbitration clause, then there is an end of the matter, for the arbitrators would have jurisdiction to adjudicate on the disputes, and we are not concerned with any error of law or fact committed by them or any omission on their part to consider any of the matters.
In this view, it would not be for us to determine the true construction of the contract and find out whether the respondents ' contention is correct or not.
Once the dispute is found to be within the scope of the arbitration clause, it is no part of the province of the court to enter into the merits of the dispute.
In the result, we allow this appeal, set aside the judgment of the appellate Bench of the High Court and re store the order of Sinha J.
The appellants will be entitled to their costs throughout.
MAHAJAN J. I agree with my brother Fazl Ali that this appeal be allowed with costs.
Appeal allowed.
","The appellants, a firm of brokers, entered into a contrct for the sale and purchase of a quantity of jute under a ""sold note"" addressed to the respondents which they signed as ""A & Co., brokers"" and a ""bought note"" of the same date and for the same quantity of jute addressed to a third person in which also they signed as ""A & C0.
, brokers "".
The"" sold note"" contained the usual arbitration clause under which all matters, questions, disputes, differences and/or claims, arising out of and/or concerning, and/or in connec tion and/or in consequence of, or relating to, the contract . . shall be referred to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce.
"" A dispute having arisen with regard to a matter which admittedly arose out of the contract evidenced by the sold note, the appellants referred the dispute for arbitration.
The respondents raised before the arbitrators the further contention that as the appel lants were only brokers they were not entitled to refer the matter to arbitration.
The arbitrators made an award in favour of the appellants.
The respondents made an applica tion to the.
High Court under the Indian Arbitration Act for setting aside the award: Held that, assuming that it was open to the respondents to raise this objection at that stage, inasmuch as this further dispute 793 was also one which turned on the true interpretation of the contract and the respondents must have recourse to the contract to establish their claim, this was also a dispute arising out of or concerning the contract and as such fell within the arbitration clause, and the award could not be set aside under the Indian , on the ground that it was beyond jurisdiction and void.

February 23.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
The earlier of the two petitions has been filed by one Ujagar Singh, under article 32 of the Constitution of India, for a writ of habeas corpus and for an order of release from detention.
The latter petition is a similar one by one Jagiit Singh.
In both the petitions, the respondent is the State of Punjab.
The orders of deten tion were made under the preventive Detention Act IV of 1950.
The petitions are not connected with each other, except that they raise the same grounds.
In petition No. 149 of 1950, Ujagar Singh was originally arrested and detained under the East punjab Public Safety Act on 29th September, 1948.He was released on 28th March, 1949, but on the same date, there was an internment order against him.
On 29th September, 1949, he was rearrested.
On 2nd March, 1950, an order of detention under the , was served on him, and on 3rd April, 1950, he was served with the grounds of detention dated 11th March, 1950.
Both in September, 1949, and in March, 1950, the ground alleged was ' 'You tried to create public disor der amongst tenants in Una Tehsil by circulating and dis tributing objectionable literature issued by underground communists.
"" Additional grounds were furnished in July 1950.
In petition No. 167 of 1950, Jagjit Singh was arrested on 24th July, 1948.
under the provisions of the 759 Punjab Safety Act, 1947.
After the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, came into force, a fresh detention order dated 14th May, 1949, was served on him and he continued to be kept in jail.
Grounds of detention were given to him on 7th September, 1949.
A fresh order of detention under the Pre ventive Detention Act (IV of 1950) dated 2nd March, 1950, was served on 7th March, 1950.
Grounds of detention dated 11th March, 1950, were served on him on 3rd April, 1950.
Both in September 1949 and April 1950, the same ground was given, i.e., ""In pursuance of the policy of the Communist Party, you were engaged in preparing the masses for violent revolutionary campaign and attended secret party meetings to give effect to this programme.
"" Additional or supplementary grounds were served on 5th August, 1950.
Several contentions were advanced on behalf of the petitioners challenging the legality of their detention and urging that as the detention was unlawful and the petition ers ' fundamental right of personal liberty had been in fringed, they should be set at liberty.
The points taken on their behalf can be briefly summarised as follows_ As the ground of detention now mentioned was the same as the ground specified in 1948 or 1949, i.e., months earlier under the Provincial Acts, the order of detention was made mechanical ly and was really mala fide in the sense that there is nothing to show that were was any fresh satisfaction on the part of the detaining authority that detention was necessary in the interests of public order.
Secondly, the grounds were not given ""as soon as may be"", which is required under section 7 of the Act; and as an unusually long period of time elapsed between the order of detention and the giving of the grounds, the detention must be held to be unlawful after the lapse of a reasonable time.
Thirdly, the grounds given originally were so vague that they could not be said to be grounds at all such as would enable the detenu to make any representation against the order.
Fourthly, supplemen tary grounds could not be furnished and should not be taken into account in considering whether the 760 original order was lawful, or whether the detention became unlawful after a particular period of time.
Two other points of a subsidiary nature were also raised, namely that the order was bad as the period of detention was not specified therein as appears to be required by section 12 and that the grounds given did not purport to state that the authority making the order was the Governor of the State.
There is no substance in the last two points.
Section 12 of the Act does not require that the period of detention should be specified in the order itself where the detention is with a view to preventing any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
The section itself provides that he can be detained without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board for a period longer than three months but not exceeding one year from the date of detention.
Normally, the detention period shall not exceed three months, unless an Advisory Board reports before the expiration of the said period that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention.
See arti cle 22, clause (4), sub clause (a) of the Constitution.
Under sub clause (7) (a) of the same article, Parliament may by law prescrib, the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law provid ing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board in accordance with the provisions of sub clause (a) of clause (4).
"" Therefore, detention for more than three months can be justified either on the ground of an opinion of the Advisory Board sanctioning or warrant ing longer detention or on the ground that the detention is to secure the due maintenance of public order, in which case it cannot exceed one year in any event, as stated.
in sec tion 12 of the .
It is thus clear that the period is not to exceed three months generally, but may go up to one year in certain special cases.
In view of these provisions, the non specification of any definite period 761 in the detention order is not a material omission rendering the order itself invalid.
Under section 3 of the , the authority to make the order is the State Government.
Sec tion 166 (1) of the Constitution provides that all executive action of the Government of a State, shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the Governor.
The orders of deten tion expressly state that the Governor of Punjab was satis fied of their necessity and that they were made by his order.
The orders are signed no doubt by the Home Secre tary, but this is no defect.
The communication of the grounds need not be made directly by the authority making the order.
Section 7 does not require this.
The communica tion may be through recognized channels prescribed by the administrative rules of business.
Let us now turn our attention to the main contentions.
There is nothing strange or surprising in the fact that the same grounds have been repeated after the lapse of several months in both the cases, when it is remembered that the petitioners were under detention and in jail during the whole of the intervening period.
No fresh activities could be attributed to them.
There could only be a repetition of the original ground or grounds, whether good or bad.
It does not follow from this that the satisfaction of the detaining authority was purely mechanical and that the mind did not go with the pen.
The past conduct or antecedent history of a person can be taken into account when making a detention order, and, as a matter of fact, it is largely from prior events showing the tendencies or inclinations of the man that an inference could be drawn whether he is likely even in the future to act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
If the authority satisfied himself that the original ground was still available and that there was need for detention on its basis, no mala fides can be attributed to the authority from this fact alone.
The Act does not fix the time within which the grounds should be furnished to the person detained.
762 It merely states that the communication must be ""as soon as may be"".
This means reasonable despatch and what is reasona ble must depend on the facts of each case.
No arbitrary time limit can be set down.
The delays in the communication of the grounds in the two petitions have been adequately explained by the Home Secretary who says in this affidavits that grounds had to be supplied to nearly 250 detenus and that the printing of the necessary forms occupied some time.
According to him, he made an order even on 11 3 1950 for the supply of the grounds.
The extreme vagueness of the grounds is alone left as the chief line of attack.
As stated already, the original ground communicated in Petition No. 149 of 1950 is ""to create public disorder amongst tenants in the Tehsil by circulating and distributing objectionable literature issued by underground communists.
"" In the other petition, the ground is ""In pursuance of the policy of the Communist Party you were engaged in preparing the masses for violent revolu tionary campaign and attended secret party meetings to give effect to this programme.
"" We shall leave aside for the moment the supplementary grounds furnished later.
There can be little doubt that in both the cases the grounds furnished in the first instance were highly vague.
If we had only Iswar Das 's case to go by, Petition No. 30 of 1950, such vagueness by itself would constitute a justifica tion for release of the petitioners.
Since the date of that decision, however.
this Court had to consider the question at great length in two cases from Bombay and Calcutta re spectively Cases Nos. 22 and 24 of 1950 where the subject of the meaning and scope of section 7 of the and article 22, sub clauses (5) and (6)of the Constitution of India.
came up for elaborate consideration.
The said cases were decided on 25th January, 1951, and we are now governed by the principles laid down in these judg ments.
It was held by a majority of the Judges in Case No. 22 of 1950 (1) State of Bombay vs Atmaram Sridhar Vaidya [1951] S.C.R. 167.
763 (a) that mere vagueness of grounds standing by itself and without leading to an inference of mala fides or lack of good faith is not a justiciable issue in a court of law for the necessity of making ' the order, inasmuch as the ground or grounds on which the order of detention was made is a matter for the subjective satisfaction of the Government or of the detaining authority; (b) that there is nothing in the Act to prevent particulars of the grounds being furnished to the detenu within a reasonable time, so that he may have the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the detention order what is reasonable time being dependent on the facts of each case; (c) that failure to furnish grounds with the speedy addition of such particulars as would enable the detenu to make a representation at the earliest opportunity against the detention order can be considered by a court of law as an.
invasion of a fundamen tal right or safeguard guaranteed by the Constitution, viz., being given the earliest opportunity to make a representa tion;and (d) that no new grounds could be supplied to strengthen or fortify the original order of detention.
We are not concerned so much with the earlier history of the detenus as with what happened to them under the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950.
OverloOking the fact that the ground mentioned In March 1950 was the same as that given in September 1949, and condoning the vagueness in the original ground furnished in both the cases to support the making Of the order, it is impossible to justify the delay of nearly four months in furnishing what have been called additional or supplementary grounds, Let us take up Petition No. 149 first.
In the grounds furnished in July 1950, there are several which do not apparently relate to the original ground.
""You were respon sible for hartal by labourers working on Bhalera Dam in October 1947"". ""You instigated labourers working in Nangal in 1948 to go on strike to secure the acceptance of their demands"" ""After release you absconded yourself from your village and 99 764 remained untraced for a considerable period"" . ""When you were re arrested on 29 9 1949, lot of objectionable communist literature was recovered from your personal search"" are instances of new grounds, and they have to be eliminated therefore from consideration.
In Jagjit Singh 's petition No. 167 of 1950, the supplemental grounds, which are as many as ten in number, are dated 31 7 1950, but they were served on him on 5 8 1950, that is two days after he had prepared his petition to this court under article 32 of the Constitution.
The grounds may be taken as particulars of the general allegation made against him on 3 4 1950 when the original grounds of detention were served.
But the time factor to enable him to make a representation at the earliest opportunity was not borne in mind or adhered to.
In the affidavit of Shri Vishan Bhagwan, Home Secretary to the Punjab Government, dated 6th September, 1950, no explanation has been offered for this abnormal delay in the specification of the particulars.
This delay is very unfor tunate indeed.
But for its occurrence the petitioner would not have been able to urge that one of the valuable rights guaranteed to him by the Constitution has been violated.
It is not alleged b.y the Home Secretary that the detenu was furnished with these particulars when he was arrested and detained under the Provincial Act and that consequently it was considered unnecessary to give him the same particu lars once over.
On the other hand, the detenu 's complaint has throughout been that he was given no particulars at all till the 5th August, 1950.
As the petitioners were given only vague grounds which were not particularised or made specific so as to afford them the earliest opportunity of making representations against their detention orders, and their having been inex cusable delay in acquainting them with particulars of what was alleged.
the petitioners have to be released, the rules being made absolute.
Ordered accordingly.

I concur in the order proposed by my learned brother Chandrasekhara Aiyar J. DAS J.
In view of the majority decision in Case No. 22 of 1950 (The State of Bombay vs Atma Ram Sridhar Acharya), I concur in the order proposed by my learned brother.
Order accordingly.
Petition No. 194 of 1950 Agent for the petitioner: R.R. Biswas.
Agent for the intervener: P.A. Mehta.
Petition No. 167 of 1950 Agent for the petition: R.S. Narula.
","Non specification of any definite period in a detention order made under section 3 of the Preventive Detention Act, IV of 1950, is not a material omission rendering the order invalid in view of the provisions contained in clauses (4) (a) and (7) (a) of article 22 the Constitution and section 12 of the Act.
An order of detention which expressly states that the Government of the State concerned was satisfied of the necessity of 757 making such an order and that it was made by the order of the Governor is not defective merely because it is signed by Home Secretary.
Communication of the grounds of the order need not be made directly by the authority making the order but may be made through recognized channels prescribed by the adminis trative rules of business.
The past conduct or antecedent history of a person can be taken into account in making a detention order, and as a matter of fact, it is largely from prior events showing tendencies or inclinations of a man that an inference could be drawn whether he is likely even in the future to act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order.
If the authority making an order is satisfied that the ground on which the detenue was detained on a former occasion is still available and that there was need for detention on its basis no mala fides can be attributed to the authority from the fact that the ground alleged for the second detention is the same as that of the first detention.
Whether grounds have been communicated ""as soon as may be"" must depend on the facts of each case.
No arbitrary time limit can be laid down.
The recent rulings of the Supreme Court establish (a) that mere vagueness of grounds standing by itself and with out leading to an inference of mala fides or lack of good faith is not a justiciable issue in a court of law for the necessity of making the order, inasmuch as the ground or grounds on which the order of detention was made is a matter for the subjective satisfaction of the Government or of the detaining authority; (b) that there is nothing in the Act to prevent particulars of the grounds being furnished to the detenu within a reasonable time so that he may have the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the detention order what is reasonable time being dependent on the facts of each case; (c) that failure to furnish grounds with the speedy addition of such particulars as would enable the detenu to make a representation at the earliest opportu nity against the detention order can be considered by a court of law as an invasion of a fundamental right or safe guard guaranteed by the Constitution, viz. being given the earliest opportunity to make a representation; and (d) that no new grounds could be supplied to strengthen or fortify the original order of detention.
Where the petitioners against whom detention orders were made were given only vague grounds and there was inex cusable delay of nearly 4 months in acquainting them of the particulars, held that their detention was illegal and they should be released.

Application under article 32 of the Constitution of India for a writ of certiorari and prohibition.
The facts are set out in the judgment.
B. Banerji for the petitioner.
M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (Gyan Chand, with him) for the opposite party.
522 1950.
May 26.
The following judgments were delivered: KANIA C.J. This is an application for a writ of 'certiorari and prohibition under article 32 of the Constitution of India.
The petitioner who is the President of the All India Hindu Mahasabha since December, 1949, was served with an order of externment dated the gist of March, 1950, that night.
By that order he is directed by the District Magis trate, Delhi, not to remain in the Delhi District, and immediately to remove himself from the Delhi District and not to return to the District.
The order was to continue in force for three months.
By another order of the Madhya Bharat Government he was directed to reside in Nagpur.
That order has been recently cancelled.
The petitioner disputes the validity of the first order on the ground that the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, under which the order was made, is an infringement of his fundamental right given under article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution of India.
He further contends that the grounds of the order served on him are vague, insufficient and incomplete.
According to him the object of the externment order passed by the District Magistrate, Delhi, was to suppress political opposition to the policy of the Government in respect of Pakistan and the Muslim League.
It is alleged that because the petitioner and the Hindu Mahasabha are against the Government policy of appeasement this order is served on him.
It is therefore mala fide and illegal.
In support of his contention about the invalidity of the East Punjab Public Safety Act and its provisions as regards externment, counsel for the petitioner relied on the recent unreported judgments of the Patna High Court in Miscellaneous Judicial Case No. 29 of 1950, Brij nandan vs The State of Bihar, and of the High Court of Bombay in Criminal Application No. 114 of 1950, re Jai singhbhai Ishwarlal Modi.
It is necessary first to ascertain the true meaning of article 19 (1) (d) read with clause (5) of the same article.
There is no doubt that by the order of extern 523 ment the right of the petitioner to freedom of movement throughout the territory of India is abridged.
The only question is whether the limits of permissible legislation under clause (5) are exceeded.
That clause provides as follows: ""19.
(5) Nothing in subclauses (d), (e) and (f) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any exist ing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe.
"" It is clear that the clause permits imposition of reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by sub clause (d)in the interests of the general public.
The rest of the provision of clause (5) is not material and neither side relies on it.
Two interpretations of the clause are put before the Court.
It is argued that grammatically understood the only question before the Court is whether the impugned legislation imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right.
To put it in other words, the only justiciable issue to be decided by the Court is whether the restrictions imposed by the legislation on the exercise of the right are reasonable.
If those restrictions on the exercise of the right are reasonable, the Court has not to consider whether the law imposing the restrictions is rea sonable.
The other interpretation is that while the Consti tution permits a law laying down reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the rights mentioned in sub clause 19 (1) (d), the reasonableness has to be of the law also.
It is submitted that in deciding whether the restrictions, on the exercise of the right are reasonable, the Court has to decide not only on the extent and nature of the restric tions on the exercise of the right but also as to whether the conditions under which the right is restricted are reasonable.
The majority judgments of the Patna and the Bombay High Courts, although the impugned Acts of the State Legislatures before them were materially different on cer tain important points, have given clause (5) of article 19 the latter meaning.
524 In my opinion, clause (5) must be given its full mean ing.
The question which the Court has to consider is wheth er the restrictions put by the impugned legislation on the exercise of the right are reasonable or not.
The question whether the provisions of the Act provide reasonable safe guards against the abuse of the power given to the executive authority tO administer the law is not relevant for the true interpretation of the 'clause.
The Court, on either inter pretation, will be entitled to consider whether the re strictions on the right to move throughout India, i.e,, both as regards the territory and the duration, are reasonable or not.
The law providing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by article 19 may contain substantive provisions as well as procedural provisions.
While the reasonableness of the restrictions has to be considered with regard to the exercise of the right, it does not necessarily exclude from the consideration of the Court the question of reasonableness of the procedural part of the law.
It is obvious that if the law prescribes five years externment or ten years externment, the question whether such period of externment is reasonable, being the substan tive part, is necessarily for the consideration of the Court under clause (5).
Similarly, if the law provides the proce dure under which the exercise of the right may be restrict ed, the same is also for the consideration of the Court, as it has to determine if the exercise of the right has been reasonably restricted.
I do not think by this interpretation the scope and ambit of the word ""reasonable"" as applied to restrictions on the exercise of the right, is in any way unjustifiably enlarged.
it seems that the narrow construc tion sought to be put on the expression, to restrict the Court 's power to consider only the substantive law on the point, is not correct.
In my opinion this aspect of the construction of article 19 (5) has escaped the minority judgment in the two matters mentioned above.
I am not con cerned with the conclusions of the two Courts about the invalidity of the provisions of the Acts they were asked to consider.
To the extent they help in the interpretation of article 19 (5) only they are helpful.
525 The next question is whether the impugned Act contains reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right given under article 19 (1)(d)or (e).
It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that under section 4 the power to make the order of externment was given to the Provincial Government or the District Magistrate, whose satisfaction was final.
That decision was not open to review by the Court.
On that ground it was contended that there was an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of the citizen 's right.
In my opinion, this argument is unsound.
This is not legislative delegation.
The desirability of passing an individual order of externment against a citizen has to be left to an offi cer.
In the Act such a provision cannot be made.
The satisfaction of the officer thus does not impose an unrea sonable restriction on the exercise of the citizen 's right.
So far as the Bombay High Court is concerned Chagla C.J. appears to have decided this point against the contention of the petitioner.
It was next urged that under section 4 (3) the order made by the District Magistrate shall not, unless the Pro vincial Government by special order otherwise direct, remain in force for more than three months.
It was argued that the period of three months itself was unreasonable as the ex ternee had no remedy during that time.
It was contended that when the Provincial Government directed the renewal of the order no limit of time was prescribed by the legislature for the duration of the order.
The order therefore can be in operation for an indefinite period.
This was argued to be an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of a citi zen 's right.
In this connection it may be pointed out that in respect of preventive detention, which is a more severe restriction on the right of the citizen, the Constitution itself under article 22 (4) to (7) permits preventive deten tion for three months without any remedy.
The period of three months therefore prima facie does not appear unreason able.
Under the proviso to section 4 (5) the Provincial Government is not permitted to direct the exclusion or removal from the Province of a person ordinarily residing in the Province, and similarly 526 the District Magistrate is not permitted to order the exclu sion or removal of a person ordinarily resident in his district from that district.
This is a great safeguard provided under the East Punjab Public Safety Act.
The further extension of the externment order beyond three months may be for an indefinite period, but in that connec tion the fact that the whole Act is to remain in force only up to the 14th August, 1951, cannot be overlooked.
More over, this whole argument is based on the assumption that the Provincial Government when making the order will not perform its duty and may abuse the provisions of the sec tion.
In my opinion, it is improper to start with such an assumption and decide the legality of an Act on that basis.
Abuse of the power given by a law sometimes occurs; but the validity of the law cannot be contested because of such an apprehension.
In my opinion, therefore, this contention of the petitioner cannot be accepted.
was next argued that there is no provision in the Act for furnishing grounds of externment to the citizen.
Section 4 (6) provides that when an externment order has been made its grounds may be communicated to the externee by the authority making the order and in any case when the order is to be enforced for more than three months he shall have a right of making a representation which shall be referred to the advisory tribunal constituted under section 3 (4).
While the word ""may"" ordinarily conveys the idea of a discretion and not compulsion, reading it with the last part of the clause it seems that when an externment order has to be enforced for more than three months an absolute right is given to the cxternee to make a representation.
He cannot make a representation unless he has been furnished grounds for the order.
In no other part of the Act a right to obtain the grouuds for the order in such a case is given to him.
Therefore, that right has to be read as given under the first part of section 4 (6).
That can be done only by reading the word ""may"" for that purpose as having the mean ing of ""shall"" If the word ""may"" has to be so read for that purpose, it appears to be against the well recognised canons of construction to 527 read the same ""may"" as having a different meaning when the order is to be in force for less than three months.
I do not think in putting the meaning of ""shall"" on ""may"" in the clause, I am unduly straining the language used in the clause.
So read this argument must fail.
It was next argued that there is no provision in the Act showing what the advisory board has to do when it receives a representation.
A reference to the advisory board neces sarily implies a consideration of the case by such board.
The absence of an express statement to that effect in the impugned Act does not invalidate the Act.
It was finally contended on behalf of the petitioner that the grounds for the externment order supplied to him are vague, insufficient and incomplete.
The grounds are stated as follows : ""Your activities generally and particularly since the recent trouble in East and West Bengal have been of a communal nature tending to excite hatred between communities and whereas in the present composition of the population of Delhi and the recent communal disturbances of Delhi feelings are roused between the majority and minority communities, your presence and activities in Delhi are likely to prove prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order, it is considered necessary to order you to leave Delhi.
"" These grounds cannot be described as vague, insufficient or incomplete.
It is expressly stated that the activities of the petitioner, who is the President of the Hindu Maha sabha, since the recent disturbances between two communities in the East and West Bengal have particularly been of a communal nature which excites hatred between the communi ties.
It is further stated that having regard to the recent disturbance in Delhi, the population of which is composed of both these communities, the excitement of such,hatred is likely to be dangerous to the peace and maintenance of law and order.
Apart from being vague, I think that these grounds are specific and if honestly be lieved can support the order.
The argument that the order 528 was served to stifle opposition to the Government policy of appeasement has little bearing because the District Magis trate of Delhi is not concerned with the policy of the Government of appeasement or otherwise.
The order is made because the activities of the petitioner are likely to prove prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order and the grounds specified have a direct bearing on that conclusion of the District Magistrate.
I therefore think that this contention of the petitioner must be rejected.
The result is that the petition fails and is dismissed.
FAZL ALI J.
I agree.
PATANJALI SASTRI J.
I agree that this application must fail.
As I share the views expressed by my Lord in.the judgment just delivered by him on the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the impugned legislation whichever construction of article 19 (5) of the Constitution is adopt ed, I consider it unnecessary to express any opinion on the true scope of the judicial review permitted under that article, and I hold myself free to deal with that point when it becomes necessary to do so.
MAHAJAN J. I concur in the judgment which my brother Mukh erjea is delivering and for the reasons given by him I allow the petition and quash the order of externment.
MUKHERJEA J. This is an application under article 32 of the Constitution, praying for quashing of an externment order made by the District Magistrate of Delhi, against the petitioner Dr. N.B. Khare, on 31st March, 1950, by which the latter was directed to remove himself immediately from the Delhi District and not to return to that District so long as the order remained in force.
The order is for three months at present.
Complaint was also made in the petition in respect of another and a subsequent order passed by the Government of Madhya Bharat which was served on the peti tioner on his way to Nagpur and which 529 directed him to reside within the limits of the Nagpur Municipality and not to leave that area without the permis sion of the District Magistrate of that place.
This order of the Government of Madhya Bharat, we are told, has since been withdrawn and we are not concerned with that order or the Act under which it was passed in the present proceeding.
The substantial contention raised on behalf of the petitioner is that the particular provision of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, under which the District Magistrate of Delhi purported to make the externment order, became void and ceased to be operative after the new Consti tution came into force, by reason of these provisions being inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed under article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution read with clause (5) of the same article.
The argument is that any order passed under such void legislative provisions must necessarily be void and of no effect in law.
In order to appreciate the merits of this contention, it may be convenient to advert to the material provisions of the East Punjab Public Safety Act which are alleged to have become void as well as to the articles of the Constitution, upon which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel for the petitioner.
The East Punjab Public Safety Act came into force on 29th March, 1949, and its object, as stated in the preamble, is to provide for special measures to ensure public safety and maintenance of public order.
Section 4 (1) of the Act provides: ""The Provincial Government or the District Magistrate, if satisfied with respect to any particular person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudi cial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order it is necessary so to do, may, by order in writing, give anyone or more of the following directions, namely that such person . . . . . . . . . (c) shall remove himself from, and shall not return to, any area that may be specified in the order."" , 530 Sub section (3) of the section lays down that ""An order under sub section (1) made by the District Magistrate shall not, unless the Provincial Government by special order otherwise directs, remain in force for more than three months from the making thereof."" The contention of the petitioner is that the restrictive provisions mentioned above, under which a person could be removed from a particular area or prohibited from returning to it are inconsistent with the fundamental right guaranteed by article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution under which all citizens shall have the right ""to move freely throughout the territory of India.
"" This right indeed is not absolute and the extent to which it could be curtailed by legislation is laid down in clause.(5)of article 19 which runs as follows: ""Nothing in sub clauses (d), (e) and (f) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe."" Thus the primary question which requires consideration is, whether the impugned legislation which apparently seems to be in conflict with the fundamental right enunciated in article 19 (1) (d) of the Consitution is protected by clause (5) of the article, under which a law would be valid if it imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right in the interests of the general public.
It is not disputed that the question of reasonableness is a justiciable matter which has to be determined by the Court.
If the Courts 'hold the restrictions imposed by the law to be reasonable, the petitioner would certainly have no remedy.
If, on the other hand, they are held to be unreasonable, article 13 (1)of the Constitution imposes a duty upon the Court to pronounce the law to be invalid to the extent that it is inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.
531 It has been urged, though somewhat faintly, by the learned Attorney General that the right of free movement throughout the Indian territory as enunciated in article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution contemplates nothing else but absence of inter State restrictions, which might prevent citizens of the Indian Union from moving from one State to another.
A law which does not impose barriers of this kind, it is said, cannot be inconsistent with the fundamental right secured by this clause.
Such a restricted interpreta tion is, in my opinion, not at all warranted by the language of the sub clause.
What article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitu tion guarantees is the free right of all citizens to go wherever they like in the Indian territory without any kind of restriction whatsoever.
They can move not merely from one State to another but from one place to another within the same State and what the Constitution lays stress upon is that the entire Indian territory is one unit so far as the citizens are concerned.
Clause (c) of section 4 (1) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, 1949, authorises the Provin cial Government or the District Magistrate to direct any person to remove himself from any area and prohibit him from entering the same.
On the face of it such provision repre sents an interference with the.
fundamental right guaran teed by article 19 (1) (d) of the Constitution.
The contro versy, therefore, narrows down to this, whether the impugned legislation is saved by reason of its being within the permissible limits prescribed by clause (5) of article 19.
With regard to clause (5), the learned AttorneyGeneral points out at the outset that the word ""reasonable"" occur ring in the clause qualifies ""restrictions"" and not ""law '"".
It is argued that in applying the clause, all that we have to see is whether the restrictions that are imposed upon the exercise of the right by law are reasonable or not and we have not to enquire into the reasonableness or otherwise of the law itself.
The reasonableness of the restrictions can be judged, ' according to the learned Attorney General, from the nature of the restrictions themselves and not from the manner in which or the authorities by which they are 532 imposed.
The question whether the operation of the law produces hardship in individual cases is also a matter which is quite irrelevant to our enquiry.
I do agree that in clause (5) the adjective 'reasonable ' is predicated of the restrictions that are imposed by law and not of the law itself; but that does not mean that in deciding the reasonableness or otherwise of the restric tions, we have to confine ourselves to an examination of the restrictions in the abstract with reference merely to their duration or territorial extent, and that it is beyond our province to look up to the circumstances under which or the manner in which the restrictions have been imposed.
It is not possible to formulate an effective test which would enable us to pronounce any particular restriction to be reasonable or unreasonable per se.
All the attendant cir cumstances must be taken into consideration and one cannot dissociate the actual contents of the restrictions from the manner of their imposition or the mode of putting them into practice.
The question of reasonableness of the restric tions imposed by a law may arise as much from the substan tive part of the law as from its procedural portion.
Thus, although I agree with the learned Attorney General that the word ""reasonable"" in clause (5) of article 19 goes with ""restrictions"" and not with ""law,"" I cannot accept his suggestion as regards the proper way of determining the reasonableness of the restrictions which a legislation might impose upon the exercise of the right of free movement.
Coming now to the provisions of the impugned Act, Mr. Baner jee 's main contention is that section 4 (1) (c)of the East Punjab Public Safety Act, which provides for passing of orders removing a person from a particular area, on the satisfaction of the Provincial Government or the District Magistrate, cannot be a reasonable piece of legislation inasmuch as the only pre requisite for imposition of the restrictions is the personal satisfaction of certain indi viduals or authorities, the propriety or reasonableness of which cannot be tested by the application of any external rule or standard.
It is said that any law which places the liberty 533 of a subject at the mercy of an executive officer, however high placed he might be and whose action cannot be reviewed by a judicial tribunal, is an arbitrary and not a reasonable exercise of legislative powers.
The contention requires careful examination.
It is not disputed that under clause (5) of article 19, the reasonableness of a challenged legislation has to be determined by a Court and the Court decides such matters by applying some objective standard which is said to be the standard of an average prudent man.
Judged by such standard which is sometimes described as an external yard stick, the vesting of authority in particular officers to take prompt action under emergent circumstances, entirely on their own responsibility or personal satisfaction, is not necessarily unreasonable.
One has to take into account the whole scheme of the legislation and the circumstances under which the restrictive orders could be made.
The object of the East Punjab Public Safety Act is to pro vide for special measures to ensure public safety and maintenance of public order.
Under section 4 (1) (c) of the Act, the Provincial Govern ment or the District Magistrate may make an order directing the removal of a certain person from a particular area, if they are satisfied that such order is necessary to prevent such person from acting in any way prejudicial to public safety or maintenance of public order.
Preventive orders by their very nature cannot be made after any judicial enquiry or trial.
If emergent steps have got to be taken to prevent apprehended acts which are likely to jeopardise the inter ests or safety of the public, somebody must be given the power of taking the initial steps on his own responsibility; and no reasonable objection could be taken if the authority, who is given the power, is also entrusted with the responsi bility of maintaining order and public peace in any particu lar district or province.
The preventive provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code are based on similar principle.
In my opinion, therefore, the provision of section 4 (1) (c) of the East Punjab Public Safety Act cannot be pronounced to be unreasonable, simply because the order could be passed by the Provincial Government 534 or the District Magistrate on their own personal satisfac tion and not on materials which satisfy certain objective tests.
But though certain authorities can be invested with powers to make the initial orders on their own satisfaction in cases of this description, the position would certainly be different if the order thus made is allowed to continue for any indefinite period of time without giving the ag grieved person an opportunity to say what he has got to say against the order.
I have already set out the provisions of sub section (3) of section 4 which deals with duration of the orders made under the various clauses of sub section (1).
It will be seen from this sub section that there is absolutely no limit as to the period of time during which an externment order would remain in force if the order is made by the Provincial Government.
The Provincial Government has been given unlimited authority in this respect and they can keep the order in force as long as they chose to do so.
As regards orders made by a District Magistrate, the period indeed has been fixed at three months, but even here the Provincial Government is competent to extend it to any length of time by means of a special order.
The law does not fix any maximum period beyond which the order cannot continue; and the fact that the Act itself would expire in August, 1951, is, in my opinion, not a relevant matter for consideration in this connection at all.
I have no hesi tation in holding that the provision of sub section (3) of section 4 is manifestly unreasonable and cannot be supported on any just ground.
One could understand that the exigen cies of circumstances might justify the vesting of plenary powers on certain authorities which could pass orders on their ' own personal satisfaction temporarily and for a short period of time; but if these orders are to continue indefi nitely, it is only fair that an opportunity should be given to the person against whom such order is made to say what he has to say in answer to the allegations made against him.
There may not be an investigation by a regular Court but it is necessary that the aggrieved person should be given a fair hearing and that by an 535 impartial tribunal.
The provision of the impugned Act which has bearing on this point is contained in sub section (6) of section 4 and it runs as follows: ""When an order has been made in respect of any person under any of the clauses under section 4, sub section (1), or sub section (2) the grounds of it may be communicated to him by the authority making the order and in any case, when the order is to be in force for more than three months, he shall have a right of making a representation which shall be referred to the Advisory Tribunal, constituted under section 3, sub section (4).
"" It will be noted that the first part of the subsection makes it entirely optional with the authorities to communi cate the grounds, upon which the order is made, to the person affected by it.
The grounds need not be communicated at all if the authorities so desire.
As regards the right of representation the latter part of the sub section seems to imply that when the order is to remain in force for more than three months, the right of representation should be given to the aggrieved person and the representation shall be referred for consideration to the advisory tribunal constituted under section 3, sub section (4), of the Act.
The right, however, is purely illusory as would appear from the fact that even in cases where the order is to be opera tive for more than three months, there is no obligation on the part of the authorities to communicate to the person the grounds upon which the order was made.
The aggrieved person consequently may not at all be apprised of the allegations made against him and it will be impossible for him to make any adequate or proper representation, if he is not told on what grounds the order was passed.
In my opinion, this is an equally unreasonable provision and neither sub section (3) nor sub section (6) of section 4 of the Act can be said to have imposed restrictions which are reasonable in the inter ests of the general public.
My conclusion, therefore, is that under article 13 (1) of the Indian Constitution, these provisions of the Act became void and inoperative after the Constitution came into 536 force, and consequently the order made by the District Magistrate in the present case cannot stand.
I would, therefore, allow the application and quash the externment order that has been passed against the petition er.

Per MUKHERJEA J. (MAHAJAN J. concurring) Though certain authorities can be invested with power to make 521 initial orders on their own satisfaction in cases of this description, and section 4 (1) (c) of the East punjab Public Safety Act cannot be pronounced to be unreasonable simply because an order I could be passed by the Provincial Gov ernment or the District Magistrate on their own personal satisfaction and not on materials, which satisfy certain objective tests, yet, the position would be different if the order thus made is allowed to continue for any indefinite period of time without giving the aggrieved person an oppor tunity to say what he has got to say against the order; and inasmuch as sub section
(3) of section 4 prescribes no limit to the period of time during which an externment order would remain in force if it is made by the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Government is also given power to keep an order made by a District Magistrate in force for an indefinite period, the provisions of sub section
(3) are manifestly unrea sonable.
The provisions of sub section
(6)of section 4 are also unreasonable as they make it entirely optional with the authorities to communicate to the person affected, the grounds upon which the order is made.
Neither sub section
(3) nor sub section
(6) of section 4 can, therefore, be said to have imposed restrictions which are reasonable in the interests of the general public within the meaning of article 19 (5) and these provisions of the Act were consequently void and inoperative under article 13 (1)of the Constitution, and the externment order was illegal.
Held also, per KANIA C.J., FAZL ALI, MAHAJAN and MUKH ERJEA JJ.
Whether the restrictions imposed by a legislative enactment upon the fundamental right guaranteed by article 19 (1) (d) are reasonable within the meaning of article 19 (5) of the Constitution would depend as much on the procedural portion of the law as the substantive part of it] and in considering whether such restrictions are reasonable the Court is not therefore bound to confine itself to an exami nation of the reasonableness of the restrictions in the abstract with reference to their duration and territorial extent.
The Court can also consider the reasonableness of the procedural part of the law and the circumstances under which, and the manner in which, the restrictions have been imposed.

March 5.
The judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.
This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dismissing a revi sion petition against the conviction of the appellant for an offence under section 186 of the Indian Penal Code.
The appellant was at all material times the General Manager of the Jagdishpur Zamindary Company (hereinafter referred to as the company) who were the lessees of a sugar factory referred to in these proceedings as the Bhita Sugar Factory.
He was prosecuted for obstructing the then District Magistrate and the Special Officer incharge of Rationing, Patna, in the discharge of their official functions when they went to the factory on 6th December, 1947, to remove 5,000 maunds of sugar which had been seized out of the stock held by the company pursuant to an order of the Government of Bihar dated 5th December, 1047.
The case for the prose cution was as follows: The company had deliberately failed to comply with the orders for supply of sugar issued from time to time under the provisions of the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1047, by officers of the Government duly authorised in that behalf.
and, in consequence, the Government made the following order on 5th December, 1947 : ""In exercise of the powers conferred on the Central Government by cl.
(1) of sub section (2) of section 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, which have been delegated to the Provincial Government in relation to foodstuffs in the notification of the Government of India, Department of Food, No. PY 603 (2) 1 dated 21st October, 1946, the Governor of Bihar is pleased : (1) to authorise the District Magistrate, Patna, and/or the Special Officer in charge of Rationing, Patna, to search the stock of sugar held by Messrs. Jagdishpur Zamind ary Company, Bhita, in the District of Patna, which is about to commit a contravention of 306 the order of the Chief Controller of Prices and Supplies, Bihar, made under cl. 7 (1) (ii) of the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1947, and issued in order No. 1613 P.C.R. dated 27th September, 1947, in so far as the said order relates to the said Company, and (2) to direct that 5,000 maunds of sugar held in stock by the said Company shall be seized.
By order of the Governor of Bihar Sd.
T.P. SINGH, Secretary to Government.
"" On the 6th December, 1947, when the officers named went to the factory to carry cut the aforesaid order, they were told by the appellant that he would do everything possible to obstruct the removal of the sugar, and accordingly it was found that the sugar godowns had been locked and the road leading to them blocked by heaps of coal, firewood and tins placed across, so as to make vehicular traffic impos sible.
A railway siding leading to the godowns had also been rendered unserviceable by the removal of some of the rails and fishplates.
As a result of such obstruction, the officers had to seek the aid of armed police to break open the locks, repair the railway line and clear the road block before the sugar could be removed from the factory.
The appellant 's main defence was that on a proper con struction of section 3 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, hereinafter referred to as the Act) it was not competent for the Government to pass the order of 5th December, 1947, which was consequently illegal and void, and that obstruction to the execution of that order could not constitute an offence under section 186 of the Indian Penal Code.
The contention was rejected and the appellant was convicted and sentenced to simple imprisonment for a term of three weeks.
On appeal, the Sessions Judge, Patna, confirmed the conviction and sentence, agreeing with the findings of the trial court, and a Revision Petition preferred by the appel lant was rejected by the High Court, 307 which, however, granted a certificate under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution that the case was a fit one for appeal to this court as it involved a point of ""sufficient public importance"" as to the interpretation of section 3 of the Act.
Section 3, so far as it is material here, runs as follows : ""3.
(1) The Central Government, so far as it appears to it to be necessary or expedient for maintaining or increas ing supplies of any essential commodity, or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices, may, by notified order, provide for regulating or prohibiting the production, supply and distribution thereof, and trade and commerce therein.
(2) Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section (1), an order made thereunder may provide (j) for any incidental and supplementary matters, in cluding in particular the entering, and search of premises, vehicles, vessels and aircraft, the seizure by a person authorised to make such search of any articles in respect of which such person has reason to believe that a contravention of the order has been, is being, or is about to be commit ted, the grant or issue of licences, permits or other docu ments, and the charging of fees therefor.
"" It was contended that an order under sub section (1) should be in the nature of a rule or regulation of general application, like the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1947, issued by the Central Government on 4th August, 1947, as the sub section confers on the Central Government only the power to ""provide for regulating or prohibiting"" the production, supply, distribution, etc., of essential commodities, and does not authorise the making of ad hoc or special orders with respect to any particular person or thing.
We see no reason to place such a restricted con struction on the scope of the power conferred on the Central Government.
The term ""notified order"" which is defined as meaning ""an 40 308 order notified in the official Gazette"" is wide enough to cover special as well as general orders relating to the matters specified in section 3.
The power to provide for regulating or prohibiting production, distribution and supply conferred on an executive body may well include the power to regulate or prohibit by issuing directions to a particular producer or dealer or by requiring any specific act to be done or forborne in regard to production, etc., and the provisions of section 4 lend support to that view.
The Central Government is empowered under the latter section to delegate its power to make orders under section 3, sub ject to conditions to be specified, to any officer or subor dinate authority either of the Central or a Provincial Government.
It would be strange, if, as contended for the appellant, a subordinate officer in charge, say, of a small area, should, by delegation, exercise powers of a legisla tive character in relation to the matters specified in section 3, but should not have the power of issuing special orders concerning specific individuals or things.
We do not think that such a situation could have been contemplated.
The power delegated under section 4 must, in our opinion, include the power of issuing directions to any producer or dealer in relation to production, etc., of any specified essential commodity.
If so, the delegating authority itself must possess such power under section 3.
For instance, section 7 of the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1947, made by the Central Government empowers the"" Control ler"" ""to issue directions to any producer or dealer to supply sugar or sugar products"" to specified areas, persons or organisations.
This delegation is expressed to be made ""in exercise of the powers conferred by sections 3 and 4"" of the Act, but unless the Central Government itself had the power of issuing such directions under section 3, it could not delegate that power to the Controller under section 4.
This view is reinforced by the language of section 15, which contemplates orders under section 3 being made against a particular person, for it speaks of ""an order made under section 3 which prohibits him (that 309 is, the person prosecuted for its contravention) from doing any act or being in possession of a thing without lawful authority etc.
"" The restricted construction of section 3 contended for by the appellant 's counsel would render the scheme of the Act largely unworkable, and we have no hesita tion in rejecting it.
Even so, it was argued, an order for seizure could be made only subject to the conditions and limitations speci fied in clause (j) of sub section (2) of section 3, that is to say, only where the person authorised in that behalf ""has reason to believe that a contravention of the order [an order made under sub section (1)] has been, is being, or is about to be committed "".
In the present case, the order of 5th December, 1947, directing the seizure of 5,000 maunds of the company 's sugar, in the execution of which the appellant has been found to have obstructed the officers of the Pro vincial Government, recited that the company was ""about to commit a contravention of the order of the Chief Controller of Prices and Supplies, Bihar, made under cl. 7.
(1) (ii) of the Sugar and Sugar Products Control Order, 1947, and issued in order No. 1613 P.C.R. dated 27th September, 1947, in so far as the said order relates to the said company"".
The latter 'order, while it directed the company, among others, ""to supply sugar at the prices fixed to the approved dealers of certain Districts"", left it to the District or Sub divi sional Officer to fix quotas for the approved dealers of his District or Sub division from the District or Sub divisional allotment and to inform the company when and where the supplies are to be made.
It has been found by the courts below that the total quantity of sugar which the order required to be supplied was varied from time to time, and no quotas to approved dealers were ever fixed nor information sent to the company as to when and where supplies were to be made.
The order of the 27th September, 1947, having thus remained inchoate and incomplete and so incapable of being carried out or contravened till the 5th December, 1947, it was submitted that no seizure and removal could be lawfully ordered on the basis of an anticipated contravention 310 of such an order, and that the officers concerned in the illegal and unauthorised removal of the sugar were not acting in the discharge of their public functions.
Reference was made in this connection to the decisions of the Calcutta High Court in Lilla Singh vs Queen Empress(1) and Queen Empress vs Jogendra Nath Mukerjee(2) where it was held that the public function in the discharge of which a public servant was obstructed must be a legal or legitimately authorised function, in order that the obstruction might constitute an offence under section 186 of the Indian Penal Code.
On the other hand, counsel for the respondent main tained that for an offence under that section it was not necessary that the act which was obstructed must be duly authorised and otherwise lawful if it was being done or was sought to be done by a public servant honestly and in good faith believing that it was part of his public functions, and reliance was placed in support of this view on the decisions of the Madras High Court in Queen Empress vs Poomalai Udayan(3), Public Prosecutor vs Madava Bhonjo Santos(4) and Peer Masthan Rowther vs Emperor(5).
We think it is unnecessary for the purpose of this appeal to pro nounce on the true scope of section 186 of the Indian Penal Code as we are of opinion that the appellant 's argument must fail on another ground.
It is manifest that sub section (2) of section 3 confers no further or other powers on the Central Government than what are conferred under sub section (1), for it is ""an order made thereunder"" that may provide for one or the other of the matters specifically enumerated in sub section (2) which are only illustrative, as such enumeration is ""without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section (1)"" Seizure of an article being thus shown to fall within the purview of sub section (1), it must be competent for the Central Government or its delegate, the Provincial Government, to make an order for seizure under (1) I.L.R. 22.
(4) (2) I.L.R. (5) (3) I.L.R. 311 that sub section apart from and irrespective of the antici pated contravention of any other order as contemplated in clause (j) of sub section (2).
The order ' of 5th December, 1947, must, therefore, be held to be a valid order, notwith standing its reference to the order of the 27th September, 1947, as being about to be contravened.
If the latter order was incomplete and inoperative and consequently there could be no question of its contravention, as contended for the appellant, the reference to it in the order dated the 5th December, 1947, would be an immaterial redundancy and could not affect the validity of the latter order.
The seizure of the company 's sugar must, therefore, be regarded as duly authorised and lawful, and the appellant by ob structing its removal, committed an offence under section 186 of the Indian Penal Code even on the stricter construc tion placed on that provision by the Calcutta High Court.
The view we have expressed above receives support from the decision of the Privy Council in Sibnath Banerjee 's case(1).
Section 2(1) of the Defence of India Act, 1939, as amended by section 2 of the Defence of India (Amendment) Act, 1940, empowered the Central Government to make rules for securing the defence of British India, the public safe ty, the maintenance of public order, etc., and sub section (2) enacted ""without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section (1), the rules may provide for all or any of the following matters . "".
Among such matters was the detention of any person ""reasona bly suspected"" of having acted etc.
in a manner prejudicial to the public safety etc.
[clause (x)].
Rule 26 of the Rules made under the section, however, authorised the Gov ernment to detain a person ""if it is satisfied"" that it was necessary to detain him with a view to prevent him from acting prejudicially. ' . .The
Federal Court held (2) that this rule was ultra vires as it Went beyond the scope of clause (x) in that it left it to the satisfaction of the Government to decide whether or not it was necessary to detain a (1) ; 72 I. A.241, 248.
(2) 312 person, The decision was reversed and Lord Thankerton, delivering the judgment of the Board, observed: ""In the opinion of their Lordships, the function of subsection(2) is merely an illustrative one; the rule making power is con ferred by sub section (1), and ""the rules"" which are re ferred to in the opening sentence of subsection (2) are the rules which are authorised by, and made under, sub section (1); the provisions of sub section (2) are not restrictive of sub section(1), as, indeed is expressly stated by the words ""without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section (1)"".
""There can be no doubt as the learned Judge himself appears to have thought that the general language of sub section (1) amply justifies the terms of rule 26, and avoids any of the criticisms which the learned Judge expressed in relation to subsection (2)"".
This accords with our view of the effect of subsections (1) and (2) of section 3 of the Act.
The appeal is dismissed.
The appellant 's bail bond is cancelled and he is ordered to surrender.
Appeal dismissed.

(2) was merely illustrative, as such enumeration was ""without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section

March 14.
The judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZL ALl J.
These appeals are directed against the judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Fort William in West Bengal, confirming a decision of the Presi dent of the Calcutta Improvement Tribunal, which modified an award of the First Land Acquisition Collector of Calcutta, made under the Land Acquisition Act in respect of the acquisition of two premises, which may conveniently be referred to as Nos. 140 and 141, Cotton Street.
In order to understand the points of contest between the various claimants to the compensation awarded in the case, it seems necessary to refer to certain facts showing how they came to be interested in the premises which are the subject matter of the land acquisition proceedings.
These premises belonged at one time to one Sewanarayan Kalia, and afterwards they became the property of a deity, Sree Sree Iswar Gopal Jieu Thakur, installed by Sewanarayan Kalia at Chinsurah in the district of Hoogly.
Sewanarayan, who had three wives, died in 1836, leaving behind him his third wife, Muni Bibi, two daughters by his 334 predeceased wives, these being Jiban Kumari and Amrit Ku mari, and a mistress named Kissen Dasi.
On the 23rd August, 1836, these persons executed a deed of solenama which was in the nature of a family arrangement, by which the remainder of the estate of Sewanarayan (i.e., what was left after excluding the dedicated properties) was divided in the terms of his will, with the result that Muni Bibi got subject to certain conditions, among other properties, the premises described as 140, Cotton Street, and Jiban Kumari got the contiguous premises, No. 141, Cotton Street.
Muni Bibi and Jiban Kumari also became the she baits of the Thakur or deity with power to appoint their successors.
On the 20th January, 1848, Muni Bibi by an arpannama dedicated 140, Cotton Street, to the Thakur.
It is recited in this deed, among other things, that on account of annual droughts and inundation and consequent diminution in the produce of the lands, certain properties dedicated to the sewa of the deity had been sold for arrears of revenue, that ""Jiban Kumari had been making advances from her private funds for the expenses of jatra, mahotsob etc.
, of the deity, when the amount fell short, this being against the provisions laid down by her late husband"", that the house known as 140, Cotton Street, having been let out, was yielding a rent of Rs. 30 p.m., that after deducting the necessary expenses the surplus income left was Rs. 20 p.m., and that ""if this amount was included in the expenses for the sheba etc., of the deity every month, the provision made by her deceased husband may remain in force.
"" After reciting these facts, it is stated that the rental of the house ""shall be permanently and perpetually included in the expenses of the sheba.
"" About 20 years later, on the 30th September, 1869, Muni Bibi created a permanent (maurasi mokrari) lease of the premises bearing No. 140, Cotton Street, in her capacity as a shebait in favour of one Nehal Chand Panday (who was admittedly a benamidar for one Bhairodas Johurry), at a rental of Rs. 25 p.m. (See exhibit L a kabuliyat executed by Nehal Chand in favour of Muni Bibi).
In the same year, on the 8th 335 December, Jiban Kumari granted a permanent lease to Bhairo das Johurry, in respect of the premises known as 141, Cotton Street at a rental of Rs. 90 p.m. (See exhibit K a kabuliy at executed by Johurry in favour of Jiban Kumari).
The main question which has been raised in this case is whether the two ladies were competent to give debutter properties by way of permanent lease to another person.
In 1870, Muni Bibi died, and, on the 15th January, 1872, Jiban Kumari ap pointed Gourimoni Devi a shebait by a registered deed and dedicated the premises known as 141, Cotton Street, to the deity.
Both Jiban Kumari and Gourimoni Debi died shortly afterwards, and Gopal Das, a minor son of Gourimoni, became the shebait of the idol.
During his minority, his father, Raghubar Dayal, became his certificated guardian, and, in that capacity, he executed a usufructuary mortgage deed in respect of the Cotton Street properties to one Lal Behari Dutt, on the 31 August, 1878.
After the death of Raghubar Dayal one Ajodhya Debi and after her one Kalicharan Dutta became the certificated guardian of Gopal Das, and, on the 17th August, 1890, the latter mortgaged some debutter properties including 140and 141, Cotton Street, to Lal Behari Dutt for a sum of Rs. 2,230.
On attaining majority, Gopaldas executed on the 17th January, 1896, a usufructuary mortgage deed in respect of all debutter properties includ ing the Cotton Street houses in favour of Lal Behari Dutt for paying the previous mortgage dues which amounted on that date to Rs. 4,955 and odd.
This deed provided among ' other things that the mortgagee was to collect rents, outgoings, carry on the sheba of the deity, and that whatever balance was left out of the income of the property was to go towards the satisfaction of the mortgage dues.
Gopaldas died in 1900, leaving behind him surviving his widow, Annapuma, who also died in 1905.
By 1918, Lal Behari Dutt also was dead, and his interest in the mortgaged properties, to which reference has been made, was sold to one Naba Kishor Dutt on the 12th December, 1918.
On the 17th November, 1933, Naba Kishor assigned the mortgagee 's 336 interest in the mortgaged properties to two of the Bagarias, respondents 1 and 2 in appeal No. 95, and m the same year the three respondents (1 to 3) also acquired the lessee 's interest in the Cotton Street houses.
The land acquisition proceedings, which have given rise to these appeals, were started about the year 1934 in respect of the premises bearing Nos. 140 and 141, Cotton Street, as well as two adjoining premises with which we are not concerned in this case.
In these proceedings, the following claims were put forward by three sets of persons: 1.
The Bagarias (respondents 1 to 3 in appeal No. 95) at first claimed the entire amount of compensation on the allegation that they were the absolute owners of the prem ises in question, but later on they claimed only as mortga gees and permanent lessees of those premises.
On behalf of the deity, the entire amount of compen sation money was claimed by Deosaran Singh and Ram Lakshman Singh, who alleged themselves to be shebaits, on the basis that the premises in question were debutter properties of the deity, and the Bagarias had acquired no interest therein either by the assignment of the usufructuary mortgage or the alleged purchase of the tenant 's rights in the properties.
Respondent No. 4 claimed compensation as a lessee for 99 years on the basis of a lease alleged to have been given to him by the original landlords.
In the present appeals, we are concerned with the first two claims only, and we shall briefly state how they were dealt with by the Collector and the courts below.
On the 22nd May, 1935, the Collector awarded Rs. 31,740 as compen sation for landlord 's interests, to be shared by the deity as owner and two of the Bagarias, respondents Nos. 1 and 2 in appeal No. 95 in their capacity of usufructuary mortga gee, and awarded a sum of Rs. 1,58,000 to the respondents Nos. 1, 2 and a as compensation for their rights as perma nent tenants of the premises in question.
Subsequently, 3 separate petitions of reference were filed 337 by the a claimants against the Collector 's award and the reference made by the Collector in pursuance thereof was registered as apportionment case No. 95 of 1935 in the Court of the Calcutta Improvement Tribunal.
Meanwhile, Deosaran Singh and Ram Lakshman Singh, who had put in claims as shebaits, retired from the contest, and the President of the Tribunal appointed one Narendra Nath Rudra as the next friend of the deity to represent and protect its interests.
On the 31st August, 1938, the President of the Tribunal gave his decision, by which he substantially upheld the award of the Collector, but modified it in one respect only.
He held that the usufructuary mortgage, on the basis of which re spondents 1 and 2 had put in a claim, had been paid off and therefore they were not entitled to any compensation, and the whole sum of Rs. 31,740 should be paid to the deity.
Respondents 1 to 3 however were held entitled to the sum of Rs. 1,58,000 as permanent tenants, on the ground that leases had been created for legal necessity and therefore were binding on the deity, He also held that the deity was not entitled to question the leases by virtue of article 134 (a) of the Limitation Act.
Regarding costs, he directed that all costs incurred on behalf of the deity should be paid out of the compensation money lying in deposit in court.
Two appeals were thereafter preferred to the High Court by the two main contesting parties and ultimately both these ap peals were dismissed, and the High Court upheld the decision of the Tribunal.
Subsequently, the present appeals were preferred to this Court, the deity having obtained a certif icate granting leave to appeal from the High Court, and the Bagaria respondents having obtained special leave from the Privy Council to prefer a cross appeal.
The main questions which arise in these appeals are : (1) whether the two mourasi mokrari leases, to which reference has been made were justified by legal necessity; and 44 338 (2) whether the mortgages on the basis of which the Bagarias had laid their claim to compensation had been satisfied.
The first question arises in Appeal No. 05, and the second question arises in Appeal No. 96.
So far as the question of legal necessity is concerned, there are concurrent findings of the Tribunal and the High Court against the appellant in appeal No. 95, but we allowed his counsel to argue the question at some length, because it was urged before us that on the facts of the case the point in issue was not a question of fact but one of mixed fact and law, especially as the decision of the High Court turned upon the construction of the leases and the inference drawn from the fact that the permanent nature of the tenancy had remained unquestioned for a very long period.
The tenancy in question came into existence as long ago as 1869, and it is not surprising that no direct evidence bearing on the issue of legal necessity is available now.
We have therefore to fall back upon the recitals in the documents, to ascertain the circumstances under which the documents, exhibits L and K, were executed, because it is well settled that if all the original parties to the trans action and those who could have given evidence on the rele vant points have passed away, a recital consisting of the principal circumstances of the case assumes greater impor tance and cannot be lightly set aside.
[See Banga Chandra Dhar Biswas vs Jagat Kisore Chowdhuri(1) 1 It appears to us that the recitals in the documents afford valuable evidence, because the tenancies were created by two pious ladies who were keenly interested in the sheba of the deity and with regard to whom it was not suggested that they expected to derive any personal advantage from the transactions in question.
It seems to us most unlikely that they would be parties to any untrue recitals merely to support the trans action.
It may be recalled here that in 1848, certain properties belonging to the deity had been sold for arrears of rent, and Jiban Kumari (1) 43 I.A. 249.
339 had been supplementing the income of the residue from her own properties for meeting the expenses of performing cer tain essential services to the deity, such as jatra, mahot sob, etc.
We also find from the arpannama that the value of the property which is the subject matter of the mokrari kabuliyat dated the 30th September, 1869 (exhibit L) was Rs. 2,000 in 1848, that it was not in the khas possession of Muni Bibi but had been let out to a tenant and that its net income was Rs. 20 p.m.
At the time when the arpannama was executed, Muni Bibi clearly thought that the sum of _Rs. 20 p.m., if included in the expenses for the sheba of the deity, would enable the sheba to be carried on without any extraneous help.
From the recitals in exhibit L, it appears that the house bearing No. 140, Cotton Street, was in a dilapidated condition and had collapsed in the rains of 1270 B.S. (1868 A.D.), and Muni Bibi was unable to bear the expenses of constructing a new building at the place.
The problem before her therefore was whether the deity should go without any income from this property, or she should enter into such an arrangement as would secure a permanent income for the expenses of the deity, which should not in any case be less than the income which the property had theretofore yielded.
She decided to choose what must have appeared to her to be the better and more prudent course, with the result that she got a sum of Rs. 500 cash for the deity as the price of the materials which were sold to the lessee, and also secured a regular monthly income of Rs. 25.
There can be no doubt that the transaction was in the best inter ests of the deity and clearly beneficial to it.
A reference to the arpannama shows that the house was in the possession of a, tenant even in 1848, and from the recitals in the document it is clear that what Muni Bibi contemplated was that the house should continue to remain in the possession of a tenant, and the rent of the house should be used for the sheba of the deity.
At that time, she did not contemplate any other mode of using the property she was going to dedicate.
We do not know who was the tenant of the 340 house in 1848 and what were the commitments of Muni Bibi at that time, but, even apart from these facts, it is difficult to believe that a devout person like her, who was not only a shebait but also the widow of the founder of the deity and who had shown such keen interest for the upkeep of the worship of the deity, should have entered into the transac tion in question unless she considered it absolutely neces sary to do so.
The contention put forward before us is that it has not been shown that there was no other course open to Muni Bibi than to.
grant a permanent lease in respect of the property, but it is manifest that at this distance of time no evidence can be available to show the actual pressure or necessity which impelled Muni Bibi to adopt the course she did.
It is now well settled that where the validity of a permanent lease granted by a shebait is called into question a long time after the grant, although it is not possible to ascertainfully what the circumstances were in which it was made, the court should assume that the grant was made for necessity so as to be valid beyond the life of the grantor.
[See Bava Magniram Sitgram vs Kasturbhai Manibhai(1)].
In the present case, the circumstances which can be gathered from the recitals together with the fact that the document has remained unquestioned for more than half a century, seem to us to be quite sufficient to support the conclusion that the grant was made for legal necessity and is binding on the deity.
On the facts narrated, it would appear that there were several shebaits between the death of Muni Bibi and the commencement of the present litigation, but the lease was never impugned as being beyond the power of the shebait who granted it.
On the other hand, we find that the permanent character of the lease was recognized in a deed executed by Gourimoni on the 18th October, 1873 (exhibit Y), and in a mortgage deed executed by Raghubar Dayal, the guardian of Gopaldas, on the 31st August, 1878.
The properties in question were subsequently mortgaged by Kali Charan Dutt and Gopaldas, but neither of these persons nor (1) 41 I. A. 54.
341 the mortgagees ever came forward to question the permanent nature of the tenancy.
The counsel for the appellant relied upon exhibit VI, which is a copy of the judgment of the High Court in a suit instituted by Nabakishore Dutt in 1995 against the Adminis trator General of Bengal for the rent of the house in ques tion.
It appears from this judgment that the tenancy was admitted by the defendant and it was also admitted by him that rent was due, but he claimed that he was entitled to insist upon a receipt specifying the money to have been paid as mourasi mokrari rent.
The learned Judge, who dealt with the case, however, thought that the point raised by the defendant did not strictly speaking arise in a suit for rent, which according to him could not be converted into a suit for declaration of title, and on that basis, he passed a decree in favour of the plaintiff.
The judgment does not say in so many words that Nabakishore resisted the claim as to the tenancy being mourasi mokrari, but, however that may be, assuming that such an assertion was really made by him, it cannot affect the character of a tenancy which had re mained unquestioned for nearly half a century.
The legal position with regard to 141, Cotton Street, is almost identical with that of the adjoining premises with which we have already dealt.
As has been already stated, a mourasi mokrari tenancy was created by Jiban Kumari on the 8th December, 1869, as is evidenced by exhibit K.
This document recites among other things that the house which was the subject of the lease, ""stands in need of repairs and for want of such repairs there is chance of some portion thereof breaking down during the year.
"" It also recites that whatever income was derived till then from that house was derived by letting it out on rent and that the mourasi tenancy was being created for the purpose of repair ing the house and keeping it in existence.
At the end of the document, it is stated that ""the shebait shall keep the kabuliyat and patta in force and shall on taking the sum of Rs. 90 as rent, defray the expenses of the sheba of the deity.
"" It is 342 noteworthy that the actual dedication of this property took place on the 15th January, 1872, more than 2 years after the kabuliyat.
On that date, a registered deed of gift was executed by Jiban Kumari in favour of Srimathi Gourimoni Debi and it was recited therein that the income of the house was being dedicated by the former to the sheba of the deity.
There was also a further clause in that deed to the follow ing effect : ""In accordance with the terms of the solenama the ex penses of the Iswar seba shall be met from the income of those properties which have been dedicated for the perform ance of the work of the said seba and the amount by which the expenses for the festivals would fall short and the expenses which would be incurred for repairs to house for sheba of the said Thakur shall be met and the Tahailia (attendant) and the Brahman cook and the Brahman priest (now) employed and to be employed hereafter shall get (their) salaries, from the income of the said property."" On reading this document along with the solenama and the mok rari lease granted by Jiban Kumari, it appears that she dedicated the property after having created a mokrari lease, that what she purported to dedicate was the income derived by way of rent from the mourasi mokrari tenancy, and that she had dedicated this income for specific purposes with the object of making up the deficit in the income received from other debutter properties.
If it is held that Jiban Kumari was an absolute owner of the property at the time the moura si mokrari lease was granted and afterwards she dedicated only the income of the property then the permanent lease cannot be assailed.
If, on the other hand, it is held on reading the solenama that Jiban Kumari had only a life estate in the house and it was one of the terms of the solenama that after her death the expenses of the deity were to be borne out of the income from the house, then in that case the question may arise as to whether she was entitled to create a lease beyond her lifetime.
Such a question however does not need an elaborate answer, because the same considerations which apply to 140, Cotton Street.
will 343 apply to this house, and the presumption as to necessity which is raised by the long lapse of time, would arise here also.
This presumption is considerably strengthened here as well as in the case of the lease granted by Muni Bibi, by the fact that the grantor of the lease was so devoted to the object of the endowment that it does not seem likely that she would have granted a permanent lease unless she was impelled to do so by absolute necessity.
It seems to us therefore that the view taken by the High Court is substan tially correct and the respondents Nos. 1 and 2 are entitled to compensation as permanent lessees.
In this view, Appeal No. 95 must fail, and it is dismissed.
As to Appeal No. 96, it has been concurrently found by the President of the Tribunal and the High Court that the appellants have failed to prove by proper evidence that there is any money still due to them on the usufructuary mortgage executed by Gopaldas in 1886.
In arriving at this finding, they have dealt with every possible argument that could be urged and was urged on behalf of the appellants to show that the mortgage had not been satisfied.
This court has repeatedly held that it will not generally interfere with concurrent findings on a pure question of fact, and nothing has been shown on behalf of the appellants to induce us to depart from this rule.
In the result Appeal No. 96 also is dismissed.
Having regard to the circumstances of the case, we shall make no order as to costs in either of these appeals.

March 5.
The judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
This appeal is on behalf of the decree holders in a mortgage suit and it is directed against a judgment and order of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated January 5, 1948, by which the 294 learned Judges reversed, on appeal, an order of the District Judge of East Tanjore made in a proceeding under section 47 and Order 21, rule 2, of the Civil Procedure Code.
The material facts are not in controversy and may be briefly stated as follows.
The appellants before us are the representatives of three original plaintiffs who, as mortga gees, instituted a suit (being O.S. No. 30 of 1934) in the Court of the District Judge, East Tanjore, for enforcement of a mortgage, against the present respondent, who was defendant No. 1 in the suit, and six other persons.
The mortgage bond, upon which the suit was brought, was executed by defendant No. 1 for himself and his minor undivided brother, the defendant No. 2, and also as authorised agent on behalf of defendants 3 to 7 who were interested in a joint family business.
The suit was contested by all the defendants except defendant No. 1, against whom it proceeded ex parte, and there was a preliminary decree passed on May 15,1937, by which a sum of RS.
1,08,098 was directed to be paid by defendant No.1 and defendants 3 to 7, in default of which the plaintiffs were declared entitled to apply for a final decree for sale of the mortgaged properties, and the suit was dismissed against defendant No. 2.
Against this decree, two appeals were taken to the Madras High Court, one by defendants 3 to 7 being Appeal No. 48 of 1938 who contended that the mortgage was not binding on them or on their shares in the joint family property; and the other by the plaintiffs being Appeal No. 248 of 1938 who chal lenged the propriety of the judgment of the trial judge in so far as it dismissed their claim against defendant No. 2.
During the pendency of these appeals, the Madras Agricultur ists ' Relief Act (Act IV of 1938) came into force and appli cations were made by defendants 2 to 7 to the High Court, praying that in the event of a decree being passed against them, the decretal debt might be scaled down in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
The defendant No. 1, who did not appear at any stage of the proceeding, did not make any such application.
The High Court forwarded 295 these applications to the lower court for enquiry into the matter and for return, with its finding on the question as to whether the applicants were agriculturists, and if so, to what extent, the decretal dues should be scaled down.
The District Judge, ' after making enquiries, submitted a finding that the applicants were agriculturists and that the debt, if scaled down, would amount to Rs. 49,255 with interest thereupon at 6% per annum from 1st of October, 1937, exclu sive of costs.
On receipt of this finding, the appeals were set down for final hearing and by their judgment dated March 23, 1942, the learned Judges of the High Court accepted the finding of the court below and held that defendants 2 to 7 were entitled to have the debts scaled down; but as no application had been made on behalf of defendant No. 1, he was held entitled to no relief under the Act.
A decree was drawn up in accordance with the judgment.
The amount due by defendants 2 to 7 was stated to be Rs. 49,255 with inter est thereon at 6% per annum; while, so far as defendant No. 1 was concerned, the decree of the trial judge was affirmed subject to a slight modification regarding the rate of interest.
The defendant No. 1 thereupon filed an applica tion in the court of the District Judge, East Tanjore, claiming relief under the Agriculturists ' Relief Act alleg ing that he too was an agriculturist and hence entitled to the benefits of the Act.
The application was dismissed on February 25, 1943, on the ground that as the decree had already been passed by the High Court definitely negativing his claim to any relief under the Agriculturists ' Relief Act, such application was not entertainable by the lower court.
The next step taken by the defendant No. 1 was to file an application in the High Court itself, praying for setting aside the ex parte decree which excluded him from the benefits of Act IV of 1938.
This application was re jected by the High Court on December 13, 1943.
As no payment was made in accordance with the prelimi nary decree passed by the High Court, a final decree in terms of the same was passed by the 296 District Judge on September 25, 1943. ' Proceedings for execution of this final decree were started on August 16, 1944, in E.P. 2 of 1945 of the court of the District Judge, East Tanjore.
Two lots of the mortgaged properties were put up to sale and purchased by the decree holders for a total sum of Rs. 12,005 on July 15, 1946.
The sale was con firmed on August 17, 1946, and part satisfaction of the decree was entered for that amount.
Apparently, certain terms of settlement were thereafter offered by the judgment debtors.
The estate of the decree holders was in the hands of the Receivers and from the Receivers ' report dated January 10, 1947, it appears that the Receivers agreed with the sanction of the court, to receive Rs. 24,000 only from or on behalf of defendant No. 2 and release him and his share of the mortgaged property from the decretal charge.
Likewise, the Receivers were agreeable to receive Rs. 48,000 from defendants 3 to 7 and to release them and their proper ties from the decretal debt.
With regard to defendant No. 1, the proposal, which seems to have been accepted by the Receivers, was that the amount payable by him under the decree was to be settled at Rs. 37,500 and one Yacob Nadar would 'pay this amount on his behalf on consideration of the decree against defendant No. 1 being assigned to him by the Receivers excluding the rights of the latter to execute the decree against defendants 2 to 7 as scaled down by the High Court.
The records of the execution case show that on January 20, 1947, a sum of Rs. 24,000 was paid on behalf of defend ant No. 2; and his properties, namely, lots 2 and 6 were exonerated from the decree.
On January 27, 1947, a sum of Rs. 30,000 was paid by defendants 3 to 7 and on February 17 following, they paid a further sum of Rs. 18,610 12 0.
These three amounts aggregated to Rs. 72,610 12 0.
Nothing was done towards the payment of the sum of Rs. 37,500 by defend ant No. 1 or by Yacob Nadar, but on March 6, 1947, the defendant No. 1 deposited in court a sum of Rs. 3,215 and put in a petition under section 47 and 297 Order 21, rule 2, Civil Procedure Code, praying that as the amount thus deposited together with the payments already made completely wiped off the amount due under the decree as scaled down by the High Court in favour of defendants 2 to 7, full satisfaction of the decree might be recorded exoner ating the mortgaged properties and also the defendant No. 1 himself from any further liability in respect of the decre tal debt.
The position taken up by defendant No. 1, in substance, was that the mortgage debt was one and indivisible and even though different amounts were mentioned as payable by two groups of defendants in the decree, the decree holders were bound under the terms of the decree to release the entire mortgaged property even on payment of the amount directed to be paid by defendants 2 to 7.
In other words, even though the defendant No. 1 's application for relief under the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act was expressly rejected and he was held liable for the entire amount of the mortgage debt, he would still be entitled to avail himself of the benefit of the scaling down of the decree in favour of defendants 2 to 7.
This contention was negatived by the District Judge, but was accepted by the High Court on appeal, who allowed the application of defendant No. 1 and directed that the court below should enter up full satisfac tion of the mortgage decree.
It is against this judgment that the decree holders have come up on appeal to this court.
The learned Judges of the High Court observed at the outset that in the working of the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act alongside the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act several curious and novel situations had arisen for which it was not possible always to find logical solu tions.
They then proceeded to discuss the various decisions of the Madras High Court which had a bearing on this point and the conclusion which they reached may be summed up in their words as follows: ""It is no doubt somewhat odd that when a person is declared liable to pay a larger amount he should on 298 payment or tender of a smaller amount get his property exonerated from liability but this is inherent in and arises out of the proposition established by the decisions already dealt with, namely, that by the application of the principle of unity and indivisibility of a mortgage decree a non agriculturist can indirectly get relief which he cannot directly get"".
It seems to us that the High Court 's approach to the case has not been a proper one and the conclusion it has reached cannot be supported in law.
The learned Judges appear to have overlooked the fact that they were sitting only as an executing court and their duty was to give effect to the terms of the decree that was already passed and beyond which they could not go.
It is true that they were to interpret the decree, but under the guise of interpretation they could not make a new decree for the parties.
As said above, the mortgage decree was scaled down by the High Court in favour of defendants 2 to 7 only and the amended decree directs that the said defendants do pay into court the sum of Rs. 49,255 with certain interest and costs on payment of which the plaintiff was to bring into court all the documents in his power or possession relating to the mortgage and reconvey or retransfer the property if so required.
So far as defendant No. 1 is concerned, the decree states in clear and express terms that he is to pay the sum of Rs. 1,05,000 and odd and it is on payment of this sum only that redemption would be allowed of the mortgaged property.
If the decision of the High Court is correct, this direction in the decree would be manifestly unmeaning and without any effect.
What is said, however, on behalf of the respondent is that he is not claiming any benefit in viola tion of this clause.
By virtue of the decree against defend ants 2 to 7 being satisfied, the entire mortgaged property would, by force of the very decree, be freed from the debt and if the respondent gets any benefit thereby, such benefit would be merely incidental or consequential in its nature.
The High Court agreed in substance with this contention 299 and based its decision entirely upon the view that by opera tion of the principle of indivisibility of the mortgage decree, a non agriculturist debtor, whose debt has not been scaled down under the provisions of the Agriculturists ' Relief Act, may indirectly get the benefit of the relief which has been granted to his agriculturist co debtor under the provisions of the Act.
The general law undoubtedly is that a mortgage decree is one and indivisible and exceptions to this rule are admitted in special circumstances where the integrity of the mortgage has been disrupted at the instance of the mortgagee himself; e.g., when there is severance of the interests of the mort gagors with the consent of the mortgagee or a portion of the equity of redemption is vested in the latter.
It is to be noted, however, that the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act is a special statute which aims at giving relief not to debtors in general but only to a specified class of debtors, viz., those who are agriculturists as defined in the Act.
To this extent it trenches upon the general law and section 7 of the Act expressly provides that ""notwithstanding any law, custom, contract or decree of court to the contrary, all debts payable by an agriculturist at the commencement of this Act shall be scaled down in accordance with the provi sions of this chapter"".
Thus in case of a mortgage debt when the loan has been advanced to more than one person, if one of the debtors happens to be an agriculturist while others are not, the agriculturist debtor would certainly be enti tled to have his debts scaled down under the provisions of the Act in spite of the provision of general law which prevents a mortgagor from denying the liability of the interest which he owns in the mortgaged property to satisfy the entire mortgage debt.
There is, therefore, nothing wrong in law in scaling down a mortgage decree in favour of one of the judgment debtors, while as regards others the decree is kept intact.
The Madras High Court expressly adopted this view in Rainier vs Srinivasiah (1), which is one of the (1) [1940] 2 M. 39 39 300 decisions referred to in the judgment appealed from.
The fact that in that case it was a puisne mortgagee and not a mortgagor whose application for relief under section 19 of the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act was allowed, does not make any difference in principle.
The puisne mortgagee was made a party defendant in the suit instituted by the first mortgagee to recover his dues and as the puisne mortgagee was liable to pay the debt due to the first mortgagee, he was held to be a debtor and hence entitled to claim the benefit of section 19 of the Agriculturists ' Relief Act.
It may be mentioned here that section 14 of the Madras Agricul turists ' Relief Act which provides for separation of a debt incurred by a Hindu family, some members of which are agri culturists while others are not, affords a clear indication that the splitting up of a debt in such circumstances is quite in accordance with the scheme of the Act.
The catena of cases upon which the learned Judges of the High Court relied in support of their decision seems to proceed on a different principle altogether and whether that principle is right or wrong, it has, in our opinion, no application to a case like the present.
In this class of cases, the mortgagors were agriculturists and hence entitled to have their debts scaled down under the Agriculturists ' Relief Act, but there were purchasers of the mortgaged property who were not agriculturists, and the question arose whether a purchaser could get the benefit of the debt scaled down in favour of the original debtors.
This question was answered in the affirmative.
The reason for taking this view was thus given by the learned Judges in Arunachalam Pillai vs Seetharam(1), where the purchase of the equity of redemp tion was at an execution sale: ""When the 12th respondent purchased the properties in court auction, he took them subject to the burden of the appellant 's mortgage and if the burden is by reason of the provisions of section 8 refer.red to above reduced without pay ment, the purchase proves to that (1) 301 extent an advantageous one, and there is nothing in the Act to deprive him of the fruits of his.
lucky purchase, even though he is not an agriculturist.
He gets the benefit of the scaling down not because the provisions of the Act apply to him, for obviously they do not, but because such benefit is a necessary incident of his purchase under the general law and the Act does not deprive him of it.
"" A somewhat different reason was assigned in Pachigola vs Karatam(1) which however was a case where a portion of the.
equity of redemption was transferred to a purchaser by a private sale.
It was held that the court by allowing the mortgagor to redeem the mortgage sale was not conferring on the purchaser, a non agriculturist, the benefit of the Act, as he would have to refund to his vendor the purchase money reserved with him which as a result of the scaling down he would not have to pay to the mortgagee.
In both these cases, the question was raised in the proceeding for scaling down of the decree under the provisions of the Agricultur ists ' Relief Act itself and not at the execution stage.
There is however the case of Subramanian vs Ramachandra (2), where the question arose in course of execution pro ceedings and a purchaser of a portion of the equity of redemption was held to be entitled to the benefit of the scaled down decree in favour of the mortgagors, although his own application for relief under the Act was refused.
It is not necessary for purposes of this case to express any opinion as to the correctness or otherwise of these deci sions.
It is enough to say that the ratio decidendi in all these cases is not applicable to the case before us.
In the present case there is no purchaser of the mortgaged property and consequently there is no question of the pur chaser, who is not an agriculturist himself, being entitled to the benefit of a decree which has been scaled down in favour of the agriculturist mortgagor.
Here the judg ment debtors are the mortgagors themselves and according to the plain provisions of the Agriculturists ' Relief Act there could (1) (2) 302 not be any objection to a decree for reduced amount being passed against an agriculturist debtor, while the same relief is not given to his co debtors who do not fulfil that description.
Some exception could undoubtedly be taken to the form and wording of the decree that has been passed in the present case.
The decree, in our opinion, should not only have stated the amount payable by defendant No. 1 and that by defendants 2 to 7 separately but should have expressly directed ,that on payment of the amount directed to be paid by defendants 2 to 7 their interest alone in the mortgaged property would not be liable to be sold.
The further direc tion should have been that in case they did not pay this amount, the whole of the mortgaged property including their interest would be sold for the entirety of the mortgage debt for which defendant No. 1 was made liable.
It is true that the decree contains no such clear directions but reading the decree as a whole and having regard to the actual decision in the case, this must be taken to be its plain implica tions.
The subsequent agreement between the parties arrived at in course of the execution proceedings by which the decreeholders agreed to release the interest of defendant No. 2 and that of defendants 3 to 7 separately on payment of certain specified amounts by 'them proceeds clearly on the assumption that the mortgage debt and the security have been split up, and in our opinion it is not possible for the defendant No. 1 to contend that the mortgage debt remained indivisible.
Our conclusion is that the view taken by the District Judge was right and should not have been disturbed.
The result is that the appeal is allowed, the order of the High Court is set aside and that of the District Judge restored.
We make no order as to costs of this appeal.
Appeal allowed.
","Under the Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act, 1938, a mortgage decree can be sealed down in favour of some of the judgment debtors alone, while as regards the others it is kept intact.
In a suit to enforce a mortgage executed by defendant No. 1 on his own behalf and on behalf of defendants Nos. 2 to 7, the defendant No. 1 remained ex parte, and the others contested the suit.
A decree for Rs. 1,08,098 was passed by the trial court.
The Madras Agriculturists ' Relief Act, 1938, was passed during the pendency of an appeal and cross appeal, and on the application of defendants Nos. 2 to 7 under the said Act the amount of the decree was sealed down to Rs. 49,255 so far as defendants Nos. 2 to 7 were con cerned.
So far as defendant No. 1 was concerned the decree for the full amount remained as it was.
Defendant No. 1 thereupon applied for scaling down, but his 293 application was rejected.
Defendants Nos. 2 to 7 deposited certain amounts and got their properties released.
Defend ant No. 1 deposited the balance of the amount that remained due under the decree as scaled down on the application of defendants Nos. 2 to 7, and prayed that full satisfaction of the decree may be recorded.
The Subordinate Judge rejected this application but the High Court, on appeal, held that defendant No. 1 was entitled to the benefit of the scaling down in favour of defendants Nos. 2 to 7, as the mortgage debt was one and indivisible.
On further appeal: Held, that the ratio decidendi of the cases in which it was held that a purchaser of mortgaged properties was enti tled to the benefit of a decree which has been scaled down, even though the purchaser himself was not an agriculturist was not applicable to the present case.
According to the plain provisions of the Act, there was no objection to a decree for a reduced amount being passed against an agricul turist debtor, while the same relief is not given to his co debtors, and defendant No. 1 was not entitled to claim the benefit of the scaling down of the decree debt in favour of defendants No. 2 to 7.

33.txt,"Appeal from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dated 14th February, 1946, in Appeal from Original Decree No. 117 of 1942 arising out of Title Suit No. 9 of 1939: Civil Appeal No. 40 of 1950.
S.C. Misra for the appellant.
N.C. Chatterjee (P. B. Gangoli, with him) for the re spondent.
154 1951.
February 5.
The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MAHAJAN J.
This appeal arises out of Suit No. 9 of 1939 instituted in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Palamau by the appellants against the respondents for a number of declarations in respect to the title to certain lands and for an injunction restraining the respondents from proceed ing with a rent suit.
The suit was decreed by the Subordi nate Judge but on appeal this decision was reversed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna and the appellants ' suit was dismissed.
The salient facts of the case are as follows: Village Darha belonged to a family of Pathaks as their ancestral lakhraj.
Over a hundred years ago the Pathaks granted the entire village in mokarrari to the ancestors of the family of Singhas (defendants ' first and second parties) at an annual jams of Rs. 24.
The mokarrari interest eventually devolved on three branches of the Singha family, each branch getting in the following proportions: Parameshwar Dayal and others, defendants ' first party, to the extent of six annas; Bisheswar Dayal Singh, defendants ' second party, to the extent of eight annas; and Madho Saran Singh, to the extent of two annas.
Subsequently, the two anna share of Madho Saran Singh was purchased by Hiranand Jha, father of the plaintiffs, jointly with.
Durganand Jha and Dharam Dayal.
Dharam Dayal was a mere benamidar for Hiranand Jha.
On the 5th June, 1916, Bisheshwar Dayal Singh purchased six anna share in the lakhraj interest from Deolal Pathak and others and on the 9th February, 1917, he purchased another two anna share from Mandil Pathak.
By virtue of these purchases he came to own the lakhraj interest to the extent of eight anna share.
He already held the mokarrari interest to the same extent which had devolved on him by inheritance.
Some time in the year 1917 or 1918 Hiranand Jha and Durganand Jha, who had acquired by purchase two anna mokar rari interest of Madho Saran Singh, 155 purchased in execution of a rent decree the raiyati interest in the whole village and came into possession of it.
They thus became mokarraridars of two anna share and raiyats of sixteen annas of the village lands.
In the year 1918, Title Suit No. 59 of 1918 was insti tuted in the court of the Subordinate Judge of Palamau for partition of the lands situate in several villages and belonging to the family of the defendants ' first and second parties.
The Jhas were impleaded as defendants in ' the suit, being co sharers in part of the property in suit.
This suit was decreed in the year 1921, and in the final partition an allotment of two annas share in Darha village was made in their favour.
The remaining fourteen anna share excluding khatian 1, 3 and 6 was allotted to the defendants ' first party.
These three khatians were allotted to Bisheshwar Dayal Singh and in exchange for the remaining portions of his interest in that village he was given some property in village Holeya.
The result of the partition proceedings was that the defendants ' first party came to hold fourteen anna mokarrari interest in village 'Darha, Bisheshwar Dayal Singh 's interest was limited to three khatians only, and the Jhas got a separate allotment for their two anna share in the mokarrari.
It appears that some time about the year 1926 the lakhraj interest holders, i.e., the Pathaks and Bisheshwar Dayal Singh, were in default in the payment of the cess due to Government.
On the 17th August, 1926, pro ceedings were taken against them for recovery of the cess and their interest was sold in execution of a certificate on the 18th October, 1927, to one Bijainandan Sahay.
The sale obviously was of the lakhraj interest.
This was confirmed on the 19th December, 1927, and a sale certificate was issued on the both March, 1928.
This was followed by deliv ery of possession on 15th July, 1928.
Possession was ob tained by one Kamta Prasad who had acquired this interest from Bijainandan Sahay on the 20th April, 1928.
On the 1st May, 1933, Kamta Prasad transferred his interest in the village to the plaintiffs who thus became proprietors of sixteen anna share in the village and mokarraridars as to two anna 156 share and raiyats of the entire sixteen annas in the whole village.
On the 21st September, 1934, the defendants ' first party as mokarraridars brought a suit against the plaintiffs for arrears of raiyati rent for the years 1338 39 F. to the extent of six annas share and for the years 134041 F. to the extent of fourteen anna share claiming that under the parti tion decree they got a fourteen anna share in the mokarrari interest in the village.
Plaintiffs contested the suit alleging that Bisheshwar 's mokarrari interest had merged in the lakhraj interest that was purchased by him from the Pathaks in the years 1916 17, and that by the sale under the Government 's certificate his whole eight anna interest in the village including both the lakhraj and the mokarrari had passed on to the plaintiffs and that the defendants ' first party could only claim rent from them to the extent of the six anna share in the mokarrari.
This plea was disallowed and the defendants ' first party 's claim for rent was decreed in full.
The decree was upheld on appeal and second appeal.
The question of title was, however, left open.
In the year 1938 another suit for rent was filed by the defendants ' first party as mokarraridars to recover fourteen anna share of the rent for the years subsequent to fasli 1341.
As a result of this suit, the plaintiffs brought the present suit for declaration and injunction on the allegation that the eight anna mokarrari interest of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh had merged in his lakhraj interest, that by the certificate sale Bisheshwar Dayal Singh lost all his interest in the village both lakhraj and mokarrari by reason of merger, that the partition decree of the year 1921 was illegal and in any case, under that decree the defendants ' first party got only six anna mokarrari interest and were entitled to realize rents from the tenants only to that extent.
An injunction was also claimed restraining the defendants from proceeding with the rent suit.
In the plaint, it was alleged that there was a private partition between the mokarraridars by virtue of which the lands of village Darha were divided between the three sets of mokarraridars, each set being 157 in separate possession of its own separate and defined shares.
It was also pleaded that there was another parti tion between the proprietors of the lakhrai interest, that is, between Bisheshwar Dayal Singh on the one hand and Deolal Pathak, Neman Pathak and Surajnath Pathak on the other, by virtue of which the lands that were in mokarrari patties of Parmeshwar Dayal Singh and others and Hiranand Jha and Durganand Jha fell in the patti of Deolal Pathak and others, while, the lands that were in the mokarrari patti of the defendants ' second party fell in his proprietary lakhraj patti and that as a result of these partitions the mokarrari interest of the defendants ' second party merged in his lakhraj interest and under a certificate sale the whole of his interest passed to the plaintiffs.
The trial Judge held that both the partitions alleged by the plaintiffs in paragraphs 5 and 8 of their plaint were proved and that the mokarrari interest of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh merged in his lakhraj interest and that at the certif icate sale the purchaser acquired his complete interest both lakhraj and mokarrari along with the eight anna lakhraj interest of the Pathaks and that the defendants ' first party were mokarraridars of six anna interest in the village and to that extent were entitled to a decree in their rent suit and could not claim a decree for rent to the extent of fourteen anna share.
The High Court in appeal held that none of the partitions alleged by the plaintiffs were proved and that the mokarrari interest of eight annas could not merge in the lakhrai interest of sixteen annas held jointly by Bisheshwar Dayal Singh with the Pathaks.
As a result of this decision the plaintiffs ' suit was dismissed.
In this appeal it was contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the High Court had erroneously held that the two partitions set up by the plaintiffs in para graphs 5 and 8 had not been proved.
It was argued that the evidence on the record, both documentary and oral, fully established the fact of the two partitions and that in view of these partitions it should have been held that Bisheshwar Dayal Singh 158 became separate owner of eight anna lakhraj interest and in that interest his mokarrari interest of eight annas merged, and that under the certificate sale the whole of this inter est passed on to the purchaser in execution and that being so, the defendants ' first party could only maintain a suit for recovery of rent from the raiyats to the extent of their six anna mokarrari interest.
In our opinion, this appeal can be disposed of on a short point without taking into consideration the respective contentions of the parties raised before us or urged in the two courts below.
The plaintiffs ' case rests solely on the allegation of merger of the eight anna lakhraj interest of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh with his mokarrari interest to the same extent.
It, however, seems to us that there was no scope for the application of the doctrine of merger to the facts disclosed by the plaintiffs in their plaint.
If the lessor purchases the lessee 's interest, the lease no doubt is extinguished as the same man cannot at the same time be both a landlord and a tenant, but there is no extinction of the lease if one of the several lessees purchases only a part of the lessor 's interest.
In such a case the leasehold and the reversion cannot be said to coincide.
It was the plaintiffs ' case that mauza Darha was orginally granted in mokarrari under a single contract of lease and it was by inheritance that the lessee 's interest devolved on three branches of the family, Bisheshwar Dayal Singh getting an interest of eight annas in the whole of the leasehold.
He then purchased a six anna interest in the entire reversion in the year 1916 and another two anna interest in it in the year 1917.
By these purchases he became a joint owner in the entire lakhraj holding to the extent of a moiety.
He, however, never came to own the entire lakhraj interest in the village or the entire mokarrari interest therein.
There was thus no coalescence of the interest of the lessor and the lessee in the whole of the estate which was subject to lakhraj and mokarrari interests and that being so, the mokarrari interest of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh did not merge in his lakhrai interest.
159 Mere purchase by Bisheshwar Dayal Singh of portions of the lakhrai interest could not bring about an extinction of the lease or break its integrity as he was only one of the several joint holders of the mokarrari interest.
An inter se partition of the mokarrari interest amongst the mokarrari dars as alleged by the plaintiffs could not affect their liability qua the lessor for the payment of the whole rent, as several tenants of a tenancy in law constitute but a single tenant, and qua the landlord they constitute one person, each constituent part of which possesses certain common rights in the whole and is liable to discharge common obligations in its entirety.
In the words of Lord Halsbury in White vs Tyndall(1), the parties to whom a demise is made hold as tenants in common but what they covenant to pay is one rent, not two rents and not each to pay half a rent but one rent.
There is a privity of the estate between the tenant and the landlord in the whole of the leasehold and he is liable for all the covenants running with the land.
In law, therefore, an inter se partition of the mokarrari interest could not affect the integrity of the lease and it could not be said that Bisheshwar Dayal Singh under the alleged partition became a mokarraridar under another con tract of lease.
Such partitions amongst several lessees inter se are usually made for convenience of enjoyment of the leasehold but they do not in any way affect the integri ty of the tenancy or make each holder of an interest in it as a separate holder of a different tenancy.
In the present case there was not even an allegation that the tenancy was severed and the several tenancies came into existence as a result of the partition qua the landlord.
Similarly the allegation of partition inter se among the several owners of the lakhraj holding could not in any way affect the integri ty of the lease in the absence of an allegation of a fresh contract between the split up owners of the holding and the different owners in the mokarrari interest.
The lakhraj holding in the village still remains a single holding and it was not alleged that it was split up in different holdings. 'All owners (1) 13 App.
263 21 160 of the lakhraj interest are jointly responsible for payment of the cess to Government and it was because of their de fault in payment of the cess that the whole lakhraj interest was sold in the certificate sale.
In this situation none of the conditions necessary for the application of the doctrine of merger can be said to have been made out by the allega tions made in the plaint.
On the plaintiffs ' own case the lease is still a live one in respect of the six anna inter est of the defendants ' first party and in these circum stances it is not possible to hold that it has become ex tinct to the extent of eight anna interest of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh in the absence of any allegation that any fresh contract, express or implied, was arrived at between the parties.
The leasehold has not in any way been drowned in the reversion and both lakhraj and mokarrari interest are still intact.
For the reasons given above we agree with the decision of the High Court that Bisheshwar Dayal Singh 's interest in the mokarrari did not merge in his lakhraj interest and that under the certificate sale it did not pass to the execution purchaser; on the other hand, it vested in the defendants ' first party by reason of the family partition and they became entitled as mokarraridars to recover rent from the plaintiffs ' raiyats to the extent of fourteen annas share.
All that passed at the certificate sale to the execu tion purchaser and subsequently to the plaintiffs was merely the lakhraj interest of the Pathaks and of Bisheshwar Dayal Singh and it could not be that at this sale qua one judg ment debtor a larger interest passed to the execution pur chaser than in respect of the other debtor.
In view of our decision that the doctrine of merger has no application to the facts of the case, the plaintiffs ' case is bound to fail.
We accordingly hold that there is no substance in this appeal and we dismiss it with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
","If a lessor purchases the whole of the lessee 's interest, the lease is extinguished by merger, but there can be no merger or extinction where one of several joint holders of the mokarrari interest purchases portion of the lakhraj interest.
A partition inter se amongst several mokarraridars does not in any way affect the integrity of the tenancy or make each holder of an interest in it a separate holder of a different tenancy, and notwithstanding such partition the mokarraridars remain liable qua the lessor for the payment of the whole rent as one tenant.

The following Judgments were delivered.
KANIA C. J This is a petition by the applicant under article 32 (1) of the Constitution of India for a writ of habeas corpus against his detention in the Madras Jail.
In the petition he has given various dates showing how he has been under detention since December, 1947.
Under the ordi nary Criminal Law he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment but those convictions were set aside.
While he was tires under detention under one of the orders of the Madras State Government, on the 1st of March, 1950, he was served with an order made under section 3 (1) of the , IV of 1950.
He challenges the legality of the order as it is contended that Act IV of 1950 contravenes the provisions of articles 13, 19 and 21 and the provisions of that Act are not in accordance with article 22 of the Con stitution.
He has also challenged the validity of the order on the ground that it is issued mala fide.
The burden of proving that allegation is on the applicant.
Because of the penal provisions of section 14 of the impugned Act the applicant has not disclosed the grounds, supplied to him, for his detention and the question of mala fides of the order therefore cannot be gone into under this petition.
The question of the validity of Act IV of 1950 was argued before us at great length.
This is the first case in which the different articles of the Constitution of India contained in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights has come for discussion before us.
The Court is indebted to the learned counsel for the applicant and the Attorney General for their assistance in interpreting the true meaning of the relevant clauses of the Constitution.
In order to appreciate the rival contentions it is useful first to bear in mind the general scheme of the Constitution.
Under article 53 of the Constitution the executive power of the Union is vested in the President and is to be exercised by him in accordance with the 96 Constitution either directly or through officers subordinate to him.
The legislative powers of the Union are divided between the Parliament and Legislatures of the States.
The ambit and limitations on their respective powers are found in article 246 read with article 245, Schedule VII, Lists 1,2 and 3 of the Constitution.
For the Union of India the Supreme Court is established and its powers and jurisdiction are set out in articles 124 to 147.
This follows the pat tern of the Government of India Act, 1935, which was the previous Constitution of the Government of India.
Unlike the American Constitution, there is no article vesting the judicial power of the Union of India in the Supreme Court.
The material points substantially altering the edifice are first in the Preamble which declares india a Sovereign Democratic Republic to secure to all its citizens justice, liberty and equality and to promote among them all, frater nity.
Part III of the Constitution is an important innova tion.
It is headed ""Fundamental Rights.
"" In that Part the word ""State"" includes both the Government of the Union and the Government of the States.
By article 13 it is expressly provided that all laws in force in the territory of India, immediately before the commencement of the Constitution, in so far as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part, to the extent of such inconsistency, are void.
There fore, all laws in operation in India on the day the Consti tution came into force, unless otherwise saved, to the extent they are inconsistent with this Chapter on Fundamen tal Rights, become automatically void.
Under article 13 (2) provision is made for legislation after the Constitution comes into operation.
It is there provided that the State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contraven tion of this clause shall to the extent of the contraven tion, be void.
Therefore, as regards future legislation also the Fundamental Rights in Part III have to be respected and, unless otherwise saved by the provisions of the Consti tution, they will be void to the extent they contravene the provisions of Part III.
Under article 245 (1) the legisla tive powers conferred under 97 article 246 are also made ""subject to the provisions of this Constitution,"" which of course includes Part III dealing with the Fundamental Rights.
The term law in article 13, is expressed to be wide enough to include Acts, Ordinances, Orders, Bye laws, Rules, Regulations and even custom or usage having, in the territory of India, the force of law.
The rest of this Part is divided in seven divisions.
""Right to Equality"" is found in articles 14 18, ""Eight to Freedom"" in articles 19 22, ""Right against Exploitation"" in articles 23 and 24, ""Right to Freedom of Religion"" in articles 25 28, ""Cultural and Educational Rights"" in articles 29 and 30, ""Right to Property"" in article 31 and ""Right to Constitu tional Remedies"" in articles 32 35.
In this case we are directly concerned only with the articles under the caption ""Right to Freedom"" (19 22) and article 32 which gives a remedy to enforce, the rights conferred by this Part.
The rest of the articles may have to be referred to only to assist in the interpretation of the above mentioned arti cles.
It is obvious that by the insertion of this Part the powers of the Legislature and the Executive, both of the Union and the States, are further curtailed and the right to enforce the Fundamental Rights found in Part III by a direct application to the Supreme Court is removed from the legislative control.
The wording of article 32 shows that the Supreme Court can be moved to grant a suitable relief, mentioned in article 32 (2), only in respect of the Funda mental Rights mentioned in Part III of the Constitution.
The petitioner is detained under a preventive detention order, made under Act IV of 1950, which has been passed by the Parliament of India.
In the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, List I contains entries specifying items in respect of which the Parliament has exclusive legislative powers.
Entry 9 is in these terms: ""preventive detention for reasons connected with Defence, Foreign Affairs or the Security of India; persons subjected to such detention."" List III of that Schedule enumerates topics on which both the Union and the States have concurrent legislative 98 powers.
Entry 3 of that List is in these terms: ""Preventive detention for reasons connected with the security of a State, the maintenance of public order or the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community; persons subjected to such detention.
"" It is not disputed that Act IV of 1950 is covered by these two Entries in List I and List III of the Seventh Schedule.
The contention of the peti tioner is that the impugned legislation abridges or in fringes the rights given by articles 19 21 and is also not in accordance with the permissive legislation on preventive detention allowed under articles 22 (4) and (7) and in particular is an infringement of the provisions of article 22 (5).
It is therefore necessary to consider in detail each of these articles and the arguments advanced in respect thereof.
Article 19 is for the protection of certain rights of freedom to citizens.
It runs as follows : ""19.
(1) All citizens shall have the right (a) to free dom of speech and expression; (b) to assemble peaceably and without arms; (c) to form associations or unions; (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India; (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; (f) to acquire, hold and dispose of property; and (g) to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. ""(2) Nothing in sub clause (a) of clause (1) shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to, or prevent the State from making any law relat ing to, libel, slander, defamation, contempt of court or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State.
(3) Nothing in sub clause (b) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposts, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of public order 99 reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right con ferred by the said sub clause.
(4) Nothing in sub clause (c) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of public order or morality, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause.
(5) Nothing in sub clauses (d), (e) and (f) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe.
(6) Nothing in sub clause (g) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of the general public, reasonable restric tions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause, and, in particular, nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it prescribes or empowers any authority to prescribe, or prevent the State from making any law prescribing or empowering any authority to prescribe, the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any pro fession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business.
"" Clause (2) specifies the limits up to which the abridge ment of the right contained in 19 (1) (a) may be permitted.
it is an exception.
Similarly clause (3) sets out the limit of abridgement of the right in 19 (1) (b) and clause (4) specifies such limits in respect of the right in 19 (1) (c).
Clause (5) is in respect of the rights mentioned in 19 (1) (d), (e) and (f) and clause (6) is in respect of the rights contained in 19 (1) (g).
It cannot be disputed that the articles collected under the caption ""Right to Freedom"" have to be considered together to appreciate the extent of the Fundamental Rights.
In the first place it is necessary to notice that 100 there is a distinction between rights given to citizens and persons.
This is clear on a perusal of the provisions of article 19 on the one hand and articles 20, 21 and 22 on the other.
In order to determine whether a right is abridged or infringed it is first necessary to determine the extent of the right given by the articles and the limitations pre scribed in the articles themselves permitting its curtail ment.
The inclusion of article 13 (1) and (2) in the Con stitution appears to be a matter of abundant caution.
Even in their absence, if any of the fundamental rights was infiringed by any legislative enactment, the Court has always the power to declare the enactment, to the extent it transgresses the limits, invalid.
The existence of article 13 (1) and (2) in the Constitution therefore is not material for the decision of the question what fundamental right is given and to what extent it is permitted to be abridged by the Constitution itself.
As the preventive detention order results in the deten tion of the applicant in a cell it was contended on his behalf that the rights specified in article 19 (1) (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g) have been infringed.
It was argued that because of his detention he cannot have a free right to speech as and where he desired and the same argument was urged in respect of the rest of the rights mentioned in sub clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g).
Although this argu ment is advanced in a case which deals with preventive detention, if correct, it should be applicable in the case of punitive detention also to any one sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the relevant section of the Indian Penal Code.
So considered, the argument must clearly be rejected.
In spite of the saving clauses (2)to(6) permitting abridge ment of the rights connected with each of them, punitive detention under several sections of the Penal Code, e.g., for theft, cheating, forgery and even ordinary assault, will be illegal. 'Unless such conclusion necessarily follows from the article, it is obvious that such construction should be avoided.
In my opinion, such result is clearly not the outcome of the Constitution.
The article has to be read without any pre conceived notions.
So read, it clearly means 101 that the legislation to be examined must be directly in respect of one of the rights mentioned in the subclauses.
If there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen 's freedom of speech or expression, or his right to assemble peaceably and without arms, etc., the question whether that legislation is saved by the relevant saving clause of article 19 will arise.
If, however, the legisla tion is not directly in respect of any of these subjects, but as a result of the operation of other legislation, for instance, for punitive or preventive detention, his right under any of these subclauses is abridged, the question of the application of article 19 does not arise.
The true approach is only to consider the directness of the legisla tion and not what will be the result of the detention other wise valid, on the mode of the detenue 's life.
On that short ground, in my opinion, this argument about the in fringement of the rights mentioned in article 19 (1) gener ally must fail.
Any other construction put on the article, it seems to me.
will be unreasonable.
It was next urged that while this interpretation may meet the contention in respect of rights under article 19 (1) (a), (b), (c), (e) and (g), the right given by article 19 (1) (d) is left untouched.
That sub clause expressly gives the right ""to move freely throughout the territory of India.
"" It was argued that by the confinement of the peti tioner under the preventive detention order his right to move freely throughout the territory of India is directly abridged and therefore the State must show that the im pugned legislation imposes only reasonable restrictions on the exercise of that right in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Sched uled Tribe, under article 19 (5).
The Court is thus en joined to inquire whether the restrictions imposed on the detained person are reasonable in the interests of the general public.
Article 14 of the Constitution gives the right to equality in these terms: ""The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.
"" 102 It was argued that the words ""within the territory of India"" are unnecessary in that article because the Parlia ment is supreme to make laws operative only within the territory of India.
Without those words also the article will bear the same meaning.
Similarly, it was urged that the words ""territory of India"" in article 19 (1) (d) may be treated as superfluous, and preventive detention would thus be an abridgement of the right to move freely.
In my opin ion, this rule of construction itself is faulty.
Because certain words may be considered superfluous (assuming them to be.
so in article 14 for the present discussion) it is quite improper to assume that they are superfluous wherever found in the rest of the Constitution.
On the contrary, in my opinion, reading sub clause (d) as a whole the words ""territory of India"" are very important.
What is sought to be protected by that sub clause is the right to freedom of movement, i.e., without restriction, throughout the terri tory of India.
Read with their natural grammatical. mean ing the sub clause only means that if restrictions are sought to be put upon movement of a citizen from State to State or even within a State such restrictions will have to be tested by the permissive limits prescribed in clause (5) of that Article.
Sub clause (d) has nothing to do with detention, preventive or punitive.
The Constitution men tions a right to freedom of movement throughout the territo ry of India, Every word of that clause must be given its true and legitimate meaning and in the construction of a Statute, particularly a Constitution, it is improper.
to omit any word which has a reasonable and proper place in it or to refrain from giving effect to its meaning.
This position is made quite clear when clause (5) is read along with this sub clause.
It permits the imposition of reasona ble.
restrictions on the exercise of such right either in the interest of general public or the protection of the interest of any Scheduled Tribe.
It is difficult to conceive of a reasonable restriction necessary in the interests of the general public for confining a person in a cell.
Such restriction may be appropriate to prevent a person from going from one Province to another or 103 one area to another, having regard to local conditions prevailing in particular areas.
The point however is made abundantly clear by the alternative, viz., for the protec tion of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe.
What protec tion of the interests of a Scheduled Tribe requires the confinement of a man in a cell ? On the other hand, pre venting the movement of a person from one part of the terri tory of India to another and the question of reasonable restriction imposed to protect the interests of a Scheduled Tribe is clearly intelligible and often noticed in the course of the administration of the country.
Scheduled Tribes have certain rights, privileges and also disabili ties.
They have their own civilization, customs and mode of life and prevention of contact with persons or groups with a particular Scheduled Tribe may be considered undesirable during a certain time or in certain conditions.
The legis lative history of India shows that Scheduled Tribes have been given a separate place on these grounds.
Reading article 19 as a whole, therefore, it seems to me that it has no application to a legislation dealing with preventive or punitive detention as its direct object.
I may point out that the acceptance of the petitioner 's argument on the interpretation of this clause will result in the Court being called upon to decide upon the reasonableness of several provisions of the Indian Penal Code and several other penal legislations as abridging this right.
Even under clause (5), the Court is permitted to apply the test of reasonable ness of the restrictions or limits not generally, but only to the extent they are either in the interests of the gener al public, e.g., in case of an epidemic, riot, etc., or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe.
In my opinion, this is not the intention of the Constitution.
Therefore the contention urged in respect of article 19 fails.
It was argued that article 19 and article 21 should be read together as implementing each other.
Article 19 gave substantive rights to citizens while article 21 prescribed that no person can be deprived of his life and personal liberty except by procedure 104 established by law.
Even so, on a true construction of article 19, it seems to me that both preventive and punitive detention are outside the scope of article 19.
In order to appreciate the true scope of article 19 it is useful to read it by itself and then to consider how far the other articles in Part HI affect or control its meaning.
It is the first article under the caption ""Right to Freedom .
"" It gives the rights mentioned in 19 (1) (a) to (g) to all citizens of India.
These rights read by them selves and apart from the controls found in clauses (2) to (6) of the same article, specify the different general rights which a free citizen in a democratic country ordi narily has.
Having specified those rights, each of them is considered separately from the point of view of a similar right in the other citizens, and also after taking into consideration the principle that individual liberty must give way, to the extent it is necessary, when the good or safety of the people generally is concerned.
Thus the right to freedom of speech and expression is given by 19 (1) (a).
But clause (2) provides that such right shall not prevent the operation of a law which relates to libel, slander, defamation, contempt of Court or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State.
Clause (2) thus only emphasizes that while the individual citizen has a free right of speech or expression, he cannot be permit ted to use the same to the detriment of a similar right in another citizen or to the detriment of the State.
Thus, all laws of libel, slander, contempt of Court or laws in respect of matters which offend against decency or morality are reaffirmed to be operative in spite of this individual right of the citizen to freedom of speech and expression.
Simi larly; that right is also subject to laws which prevent undermining the security of the State or against activities which tend to overthrow the State.
A similar analysis of clauses f3) and (4) shows similar restrictions imposed on similar grounds.
In the same way clause (5) also permits reasonable restrictions in the exercise of the right to freedom of movement throughout the territory of India, the right to reside and settle in any part of the 105 territory of India or the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property, being imposed by law provided such reasonable restrictions on the exercise of such right are in the inter est of the general ' public.
The Constitution further pro vides by the same clause that similar reasonable restric tions could be put on the exercise of those rights for the protection of the interest of a Scheduled Tribe.
This is obviously to prevent an argument being advanced that while such restriction could be put in the interest of general public, the Constitution did not provide for the imposi tion of such restriction to protect the interests of a smaller group of people only.
Reading article 19 in that way as a whole the only concept appears to be that the specified rights of a free citizen arc thus controlled by what the framers of the Constitution thought were necessary restric tions in the interest of the rest of the citizens.
Reading article 19 in that way it appears to me that the concept of the right to move freely throughout the territo ry of India is an entirely different concept from the right to ""personal liberty"" contemplated by article 21.
""Person al liberty"" covers many more rights in one sense and has a restricted meaning in another sense.
For instance, while the right to move or reside may be covered by the expression , 'personal liberty"" the right to freedom of speech (men tioned in article 19 (1) (a)) or the right to acquire, hold or dispose of property (mentioned in 19 (1) (f)) cannot be considered a part of the personal liberty of a citizen.
They form part of the liberty of a citizen but the limita tion imposed by the word ""personal""leads me to believe that those rights are not covered by the expression personal liberty.
So read there is no conflict between articles 19 and 21.
The contents and subject matters of articles 19 and 21 are thus not the same and they proceed to deal with the rights covered by their respective words from totally different angles.
As already mentioned in respect of each of the rights specified in sub clauses of article 19 (1) specific limitations in respect of each is provided, while the expression ""personal 106 liberty"" in article 21 is generally controlled by the gener al expression ""procedure established by law.
"" The Constitu tion, in article 19, and also in other articles in Part III, thus attempts to strike a balance between individ ual liberty and the general interest of the society.
The restraints provided by the Constitution on the legislative powers or the executive authority of the State thus operate as guarantees of life and personal liberty of the individu als.
Deprivation (total loss) of personal liberty, which inter alia includes the right to eat or sleep when one likes or to work or not to work as and when one pleases and sever al such rights sought to be protected by the expression ""personal liberty"" in article 21, is quite different from restriction (which is only a partial control) of the right to move freely (which is relatively a minor right of a citizen) as safeguarded by article 19 (1) (d).
Deprivation of personal liberty has not the same meaning as restriction of free movement in the territory of India.
This is made clear when the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code in Chapter VIII relating to security of peace or maintenance of public order are read.
Therefore article 19 (5) cannot apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty.
I am unable to accept the contention that the word ""deprivation"" includes within its scope ""restriction"" when interpreting article 21.
Article 22 envisages the law of preventive detention.
So does article 9.46 read with Schedule Seven, List I, Entry 9, and List III, Entry 3.
Therefore, when the subject of preventive detention is specifically dealt with in the Chapter on Fundamental Rights I do not think it is proper to consider a legisla tion ' permitting preventive detention as in conflict with the rights mentioned in article 19 (1).
Article 19 (1) does not purport to cover all aspects of liberty or of personal liberty.
In that article only certain phases of liberty are dealt with. ""Personal liberty"" would primarily mean liberty of the physical body.
The rights given under article 19 (1) do not directly come under that description.
They are rights which accompany the freedom or liberty of the person.
By their very 107 nature they are freedoms of a person assumed to be in full possession of his personal liberty.
If article 19 is considered to be the only article safeguarding personal liberty several well recognised rights, as for instance, the right to eat or drink, the right to work, play, swim and numerous other rights and activities and even the right to life will not be deemed protected under the Constitution.
I do not think that is the intention.
It seems to me improper to read article 19 as dealing with the same subject as article 21.
Article 19 gives the rights specified therein only to the citizens of India while arti cle 21 is applicable to all persons.
The word citizen is expressly defined in the Constitution to indicate only a certain section of the inhabitants of India.
Moreover, the protection given by article 21 is very general.
It is of ""law"" whatever that expression is interpreted to mean.
The legislative restrictions on the law making powers of the legislature are not here prescribed in detail as in the case of the rights specified in article 19.
In my opinion there fore article should be read as a separate complete article.
Article 21 which is also in Part III under the caption ""Right to Freedom"" runs as follows : ""No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by ","The petitioner who was detained under the Preventive Detention Act (Act IV of 1950) applied under article 32 of the Constitution for a writ of habeas corpus and for his release from detention, on the ground that the said Act contravened the provisions of articles 13, 19, 21 and 22 of the Constitu tion and was consequently ultra rites and that his detention was therefore illegal: Held, per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ.

14 did not affect the validity of the Act as a whole, and the detention of the petitioner was not illegal.
FAZL ALl and MAHAJAN JJ.
Section 12, of the Act was also ultra vires, and since it contravened the very provi sion in the 89 Constitution under which the Parliament derived its compe tence to enact the law, the detention was illegal.
Held, by the Full Court (KANIA CJ., FAZL ALI, PATANJALI SASTRI, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ.) Section 14 of the , contravenes the provisions of article 9.9.
(5) of the Constitution in so far as it prohibits a person detained from disclosing to the Court the grounds on which a detention order has been made or the representation made by him against the order of detention, and is to that extent ultra vires and void.
Per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ.
(FAZL ALI J. dissenting).
Article 19 of the Consti tution has no application to a law which relates directly to preventive detention even though as a result of an order of detention the rights referred to in sub cls.
(a) to (e) and (g) in general, and sub cl.
(d) in particular, of cl.

(5) of the said Article.
DAS J. Article 19 (1) postulates a legal capacity to exercise the rights guaranteed by it and if a citizen loses the freedom of his person by reason of lawful detention as a result of a conviction for an offence or otherwise he cannot claim the right s under sub cls.

In short the rights under sub cls.

MAHAJAN J. Whatever be the precise scope of article 19 (1) (d) and Art.19(5) the provisions of article 19(5) do not apply to a law relating to preventive detention, inasmuch as 'there is a special self contained provision in article 22 regulating it.
FAZL ALI.J.
Preventive detention is a direct infringe ment of the right guaranteed in article 19 (1) (d), even if a narrow construction is placed on the said sub clause, and a law relating to preventive detention is therefore subject to such limited judicial review as is permitted by article 19 (5).
Per KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ.
(FAZL ALl J. dissenting).
The concept of the right ""to move freely throughout the territory of India"" referred to in article 19 (1) (d), of the Constitution is entirely differ ent from the concept of the right to ""personal liberty"" referred to in article 21, and article 19 should not, therefore, be read as controlled by the provisions of article 21.
The view that article 19 guarantees substantive rights and article 21 prescribes the procedure is incorrect.
DAs J. Article 19 protects some of the important attributes of personal liber ty as independent rights and the expression ""personal liber ty"" is used in article 21 as a compendious term 90 including within Rs meaning all varieties of rights which go to make up the personal liberties of men.
FAZL ALl J. Even if it be assumed that article 19 (1) (d) does not refer to "" personal liberty"" and that it bears the restricted meaning attributed to it,that is to say, R signi fies merely the right to move from one locality to another, preventive detention must be held to affect this limited right of movement directly and substantially.
One of the objects of preventive detention is to restrain a person detained from moving from place to place so that he may not spread disaffection or indulge in dangerous activities in the places he visits.
The same consideration applies to the cases of persons who are interned or externed.
Hence, externment, interment and certain other forms of restriction on movement have always been treated as kindred matters belonging to the same group or family, and the rule which applies to one must necessarily apply to the others.
Per KANIA C. J ,, PATANJALI SASTRI and DAS 35.
(MAHAJAN 3.
dissenting).
Article 22 does not form a complete code of constitutional safeguards relating to preventive detention.
To the extent that provision is made in article 9.9, it cannot be controlled by article 9,1; but on points of procedure which expressly or by necessary implication are not dealt with by article 22, article 9.1 will apply.
DAS J. article
21 protects substantive rights by requiring a procedure and article 9.9.
lays down the minimum rules of procedure that even the Parliament cannot abrogate or overlook.
MAHAJAN J. article
99. contains a self contained code of constitutional safeguards relating to preventive detention and cannot be examined or controlled by the provisions of article 21.
The principles underlying article 21 are however kept in view in article 22 and there is no conflict between these articles.
MUKHERJEA J. Even assuming that article 22 is not a self contained code relating to preventive detention and that article 21 would apply, it is .not permissible to supplement article 22 by the application of rules of natural justice.
FAZL ALI J. article
22. does not form an exhaustive code by itself relating to preventive detention.
Parliament can make further provi sions and if it has done so article 19 (5) may be applied to see if those provisions have transgressed the bounds of reasonableness.
Per KANIA C.J., MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ.
(FAZL ALI J. dis senting).
In article 9.1 the word 'law"" has been used in the sense of State made law and not as an equivalent of law in the abstract or general sense embodying the principles of natural justice; and ""procedure established by law"" means procedure established by law made by the State, that is to say, the Union Parliament or the Legislatures of the States.
It is not proper to construe this expression in the light of the meaning given to.the expression ""due process of law"" in the American Constitution by the Supreme Court of America.
FATANJALI SASTRI cl. ""Law"" in article 21 does not mean the jus naturale of civil law but means 91 positive or State made law.
""Procedure established by law"" does not however mean any procedure which may be prescribed by a competent legislature, but the ordinary well estab lished criminal procedure, i.e., those settled.
usages and normal modes of procedure sanctioned by the Criminal Proce dure Code, which is the general law of criminal proce dure in this country.
The only alternative to this con struction, if a constitutional transgression is to be avoid ed is to interpret the reference to ""law"" as implying a constitutional 'amendment pro tanto, for it is only a law enacted by the procedure provided for such amendment that could modify or override a fundamental right without contra vening article 13 (2).
FAZL, ALI J.
There is nothing revolutionary in the view that ""procedure established by law ""must include the four principles of elementary justice which inhere in and are at the root of all civilized systems of law, and which have been stated by the American Courts and jurists as consisting in (1) notice, (2) opportunity to be heard, (3) impartial tribunal and (4) orderly course of procedure.
These four principles are really different aspects of the same right, namely, the right to be heard before one is condemned.
Hence the words ""procedure established by law "", whatever its exact meaning be, must necessarily include the principle that no person shall be condemned without hearing by an impartial tribunal.
Per KANIA C.J., FAZL ALI, PATANJALI SASTRI, MAHAJAN and DAS JJ.
Section 3 of the , does not delegate any legislative power to an executive officer but merely confers on such officer a discretion to enforce the law made by the legislature, and is not there fore invalid on this ground.
The fact that the section does not provide an objective standard for determining whether the requirements of law have been complied with, is not a ground for holding that it is invalid.
FAZL ALI J. Section 3 is however a reasonable provision only for the first step, i.e., for arrest and initial detention and must be followed by some procedure for testing the so called subjective satisfaction, which can be done only by providing a suitable machinery for examining the grounds on which the order of detention is made and considering the representations of the persons detained in relation to those grounds.
Per KANIA C. J., MAHAJAN and DAS JJ.
Section 7 of the said Act is not invalid merely because it does not provide for an oral hearing or an opportunity to lead evidence but only gives right to make a representation.
Right to an oral hearing and right to give evidence are not necessarily implied in the right to make a representation given by article 22.
Per KANIA C.J., and MAHAJAN J.
The provision contained in Sec.
11 that a person may be detained for such period as the 12 A 92 State thinks fit does not contravene article 22 (7) and it is not therefore invalid.
Per KANIA.
C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ.
(FAZL ALI and MAHAJAN JJ.
dissenting).
Article 22 (7) means that Parliament may prescribe either the circumstances under which, or the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months without reference to an advisory board.
It is not necessary that the Parliament should prescribe both.
The matters referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of sub see.
(1) of Sec. 12 constitute a sufficient description of such circumstances or classes of cases and Section 12 is not therefore open to the objection that it does not comply with article 22 (7) DAS J. Parliament has in act and substance prescribed both in clauses (a) and (b) of sub sec.
(1) of Sec. 12.
FAZL ALI and MAJAN JJ.
Article 22 (7) Means that both the circumstances and the class or classes of cases (which are two different expressions with different meanings and connotations) should be prescribed, and the prescription of one without the other will not be enough.
The enumeration of the subjects for reasons connected with which a law of preventive detention could be made contained in els.
(a) and (b) of sub see.
(1) of Sec.12 does not amount to prescribing the circumstances under which, or the class or classes of cases in which, a person can be detained for more than three months.
Per KANIA C.J.
While it is not proper to take into consideration the individual opinions of members of Parlia ment or Convention to construe the meaning of a particular clause, when a question is raised whether a certain phrase or expression was up for consideration at all or not, a reference to the debates may be permitted.

"
35.txt,"Appeal No. 42 of 1948.
Appeal against the judgment and decree dated the 21st April, 1943, of the High Court of Judicature at Patna (Fazl Ali C.J. and S.C. Chatterji J.) in First Appeal No. 17 of 1939 arising out of decree dated the 19th July, 1939, of the Subordinate Judge at Puri in Original Suit No. 62 of 1936.
Manohar Lal (G. P. Das, with him) for the appellant.
B.N. Das (Sri Kant Mahanti, with him) for the respond ents.
March 27.
The dispute in this appeal is between the fishermen residing in nine villages of Kills Marichpur, a permanently settled zamindari in the Puri Collectorate (Orissa State) and the Raja of Aul, the owner of seven annas, seven pies, and ten karants share in the zamindari.
The other sharers in the zamindari are defendants 19 to 29.
Within the ambit of the estate flows ""Devi Nadi"" with its several branches and tributaries.
Three fisheries ' 'Madhur dia, ""Marichpurdia"" and ""Maladia"" appertain to this es tate.
The controversy in this appeal concerns the fishery known as the ""Madhurdia"" fishery.
In the year 1936, three suits, Nos. 62, 63 and 64, were brought by the Raja of Aul against defendants 1 to 18 on behalf of themselves and other fishermen residing in the nine villages of Killa Marichpur for a declaration in re spect of his rights in the three above mentioned fisheries.
All these suits were decided in his favour by the trial court.
The defendants preferred no appeal in suits 63 and 64, with the result that the controversy regarding the two fisheries involved in these two suits stands concluded by the decision of the trial court.
In suit No. 62 of 1936, however, the 433 defendants preferred an appeal to the High Court and it was partially allowed.
The decree of the trial Judge in favour of the plaintiff was modified and it was held that the defendants had exclusive rights as tenants at will to fish in this fishery during the Hilsa season (Margasir to Bai sakh) and that the plaintiff was not entitled to a declara tion or an injunction in respect of that period.
The plain tiff thereupon obtained leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council and that appeal is now before us for decision.
It was alleged in the plaint that the proprietors of Marichpur zamindari are the exclusive owners of the fishery in question and have all along been exercising their right of catching fish in the same sometimes by employing fisher men and sometimes by letting out the fishery to them, that the plaintiff has ever since his acquisition of the zamind ari interest been the owner in khas possession of the fish ery right according to his share in the zamindari, that the defendants fishermen were never in possession of the said fishery, nor have they any right to it, that in the year 1918 they started proceedings under section 145, Criminal Procedure Code, to create evidence of their possession but in spite of those proceedings the plaintiff continued to be in possession of the fishery and has been catching fish by employing fishermen, that by taking advantage of the fact that there are several co sharers in the zamindari and there is mismanagement of the estate, the defendants wrong fully and unlawfully trespassed on the fishery from time to time between May, 1933, and November, 1933, and disturbed the plaintiff in the enjoyment of his right and have caused loss to him and his co sharers by catching large quantity of fish without any leave or licence.
On these allegations, the plaintiff claimed a declaration to the effect that defendants 1 to 18 in their personal and representative capacity have no right or title in the fishery known as ""Madhurdia"" fishery or to the fishery in the southern por tion of the area recorded as the river block, Risilo and Husgarh.
Prayer was also made for the grant of a perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from 434 fishing in the above fishery and in the above mentioned blocks and for the award of a sum of money by way of damages and on account of price of fish.
, The defendants contested the allegations made in the plaint and asserted that the fishermen of Killa Marichpur including the principal defendants and their ancestors, about 846 persons in all, have all along remained in undis turbed actual physical possession of the fishery known as ""Charkhatia"" alias ""Madhurdia"" fishery on a fixed annual rental of Rs. 135 7 0, and have a right to remain in posses sion in perpetuity on payment of that rent; that they have acquired this right in all possible ways, i.e., by grant, custom, adverse possession and easement.
On these pleadings of the parties the trial Judge framed as many as nine issues, the material ones being issues 6 and 7, which are in these terms : ""6.
Has the plaintiff any title to the disputed fishery ? 7.
Have the defendants Nos. 1 to 18 acquired any right, by adverse possession, prescription or custom ?"" The trial Judge on these issues held that the defendants neither in their personal nor in their representative capac ity had any right or title in the fishery in question and issued a permanent injunction against them from fishing in it.
The claim for damages was disallowed.
It was observed by the learned Judge that the defendants did not claim the right to catch all the fish found in the fishery but that they had confined their claim in respect to Hilsa fish only during the Hilsa season between the months of Margasir and Baisakh (November to April) and that as regards the other varieties of fish found in these waters during the rest of the year they did not assert any right to catch fish.
He also observed that 'the defendants did not deny that the plaintiff was the owner of the zamindari and as such owner of the soil and of the waters of the fishery, but that they claimed a subordinate right, i.e., the right of fishing in the 435 waters belonging to the plaintiff and his co sharers during the Hilsa season to the exclusion of the plaintiff and his co sharers.
In view of these contentions the onus was laid on the defendants to prove their permanent right of fishing in these waters by grant, custom, prescription or adverse possession and it was held that the defendants failed to discharge the onus that rested on them.
Acquisition of the right by grant, prescription and adverse possession was held not provable in law in favour of an indeterminate and fluc tuating body of persons.
The claim for permanent tenancy in the fishery was negatived on the ground that there was no evidence to show that the tenancy came by descent to these 846 persons from the persons who actually took it in the year 1842, or that it was obtained from all the sixteen anna landlords, or that there was any fixity of rent.
It was further said that there was no certainty as to who were the owners of the right, as to the local area over which the right was to be exercised, as to the measure of the right and of the periods during which the right could be exercised and that in these circumstances the defendants ' claim could not be upheld.
The defendants ' contention that under article 47 of the Indian Limitation Act the plaintiff had lost his right was held unsustainable and the plea of custom was ruled out on the ground that the custom alleged would be of an unreasonable kind.
All the questions raised in the trial court excepting the question of custom were canvassed by the defendants before the High Court.
The High Court in a judgment, by no means clear or satisfactory, reached the conclusion that the defendants since the time of their predecessors had all along been fishing in the disputed fishery as of right under a lost grant and that the plaintiff 's story that he had been in enjoyment of the fishery was not true and that the de fendants ' right to fish in the disputed fishery was estab lished.
One would have thought that in view of this finding the plaintiff 's suit would have been dismissed 436 but this did not happen.
The High Court proceeded to find that though from the evidence it appeared that the right was being exercised by the defendants or their predecessors from a very long time, that is to say, from the year 1842, yet there was no evidence to justify the inference that they had got a permanent right.
The defendants ' plea therefore that they were permanent tenants of the fishery in dispute was not upheld.
As regards the defendants ' contention that the plaintiff was bound by the order passed in proceedings under section 145, Criminal Procedure Code, it was found that he not having challenged that order within the prescribed period, his right to khas possession of the disputed fishery except to the extent of five pice share was extinguished under section 28 of the Limitation Act but that his proprie tary right subsisted as it was never denied.
It was further held that the plaintiff 's right to khas possession of this fishery was also extinguished by operation of article 144 of the Indian Limitation Act.
Plaintiff 's evidence that he had been catching fish during the Hilsa season by employing other fishermen was disbelieved and it was held that the defendants had been exercising exclusive right to fish in the disputed fishery during the Hilsa season adversely to the plaintiff and the other co sharers for more than twelve years.
In spite of these findings the High Court reached the somewhat strange conclusion that the defendants acquired by adverse possession a mere tenancy at will and that it could be determined by the entire body of landlords and the plain tiff being only a co sharer could not bring the present suit in his own behalf and it had not the effect of determining the tenancy and hence the plaintiff could not be granted the declaration and the injunction restraining the defendants from fishing during the Hilsa season.
As regards the point raised by the plaintiff that by reason of the change in the course of the river the fishery in dispute was not the same regarding which an order was made under section 145 proceed ings or in which the defendants have been exercising their right, it was held that this contention was without force because 437 the river was identical and the channels, whether old or new, which comprise the Madhurdia or Charikhati fishery, have always formed one connected sheet of water and that fishing in different parts of such a connected sheet of water comprised in the same fishery can hardly be said to be a separate act of aggression so as to disturb the continuity or extent of adverse possession and that the fishermen though a fluctuating body, have unity of interest and pos session and could not be described as several independent trespassers.
As a result of these findings the decree of the trial Judge was modified and the plaintiff was given a permanent injunction restraining the principal defendants from fishing in the disputed fishery except during the Hilsa season (Margasir to Baisakh) during which the defendants were declared to have exclusive right of fishing.
Against the decision of the High Court no appeal was pre ferred by the defendants though they had only been found to be in possession of the fishery in the status of mere ten ants at will.
The plaintiff challenged this decision and contested the finding that the defendants were lawfully in possession of the fishery and could exercise their right of fishing during the Hilsa season exclusively.
The real grievance of the plaintiff seems to be that by the decision under appeal the High Court has declared a fluctuating body of persons tenants at will, and that such a tenancy cannot be determined as its constitution is liable to vary with each birth and death and with influx or efflux of fishermen to and from these villages.
It was argued that the High Court has erroneously found that the defendants were in possession of the fishery and were in enjoyment of the fishing right under a lost grant and that the plaintiff 's right to khas possession of the fishery had been extin guished by operation of articles 47 and 144 of the Limita tion Act read with section 28 of the Act.
It was contended that from the evidence placed on the record the only correct conclusion to draw was that from time to time some fishermen were allowed tot fish in these waters by a number of land lords 438 on payment of rent but that the present defendants were not the descendants of those fishermen who were occasionally granted leave to fish and that those isolated acts of letting the fishery were not connected with one another and from these it could not be inferred that the defendants or their predecessors were in continuous possession of the fishery on payment of a fixed rent and that the present defendants were mere trespassers and had no right to fish in the disputed fishery.
It was further contended that no title of any kind could be presumed to exist in the defend ants to the fishery in suit and on the basis of a lost grant as in this case there was no capable grantee and that even title by adverse possession or prescription could not be acquired by them as they form an indeterminate and fluctuat ing body of persons.
As regards the finding of the High Court that the plaintiff 's suit was barred by article 47 of the Limitation Act and his title to khas possession was extinguished by operation of the provisions of section 28 of the Indian Limitation Act, it was contended that the pro ceedings that took place in the year 1918 were wrongly labelled under section 145, Criminal Procedure Code, and that in substance the order made in those proceedings fell within the ambit of section 147 of the Code and therefore article 47 had no application to the case and the plaintiff was not bound to bring his suit within three years of that order to enforce his right.
It was further contended that the order could only benefit the parties impleaded in those proceedings and the other defendants could not derive any assistance from it, that in any case the order could not bind the plaintiff to the extent of the share purchased by him from co sharers not made parties in those proceedings and that the river having changed its course in the year 1925, the fishery as it stood in 1918 was no longer in existence and in ,the substituted fishery the plaintiff 's right could not be held to have been extinguished by the effect of the order made in section 145, Criminal Procedure Code, proceedings.
The learned counsel for the respondents contended that the defendants had in the status of 439 tenants an exclusive right to fish in the fishery 'and were entitled to remain in enjoyment of it on payment of a fixed rent of Rs. 135 7 0 in perpetuity, that the plaintiff 's right of fishing in the fishery during Hilsa season had become extinguished by operation of article 47 and article 144 of the Indian Limitation Act.
It was denied that by a change in the course of the river, if any, the defendants ' right had in any way been affected.
In order to appreciate the respective contentions of the parties it is necessary to state a few facts which emerge from the documentary evidence produced in the case.
The State of Orissa came under the British rule in the year 1803.
A revenue settlement of the State was made in 1904 05.
From the village note prepared during the settle ment, it appears that Killa Marichpur was Originally owned by one Padmalav Mangaraj and that during the time of his great grandson Balabhadra Mangaraj the estate was sold in auction for satisfaction of debts incurred by him and was purchased by (1) Mohan Bhagat, (2) Chakradhar Mahapatra, and (3) the ancestors of one Haziran Nisa Bibi in equal shares.
From the jamabandi of the year 1842 (Exhibit C) it appears that the jalkor income of Killa Marichpur zamindari at that time was Rs. 135 7 0, and this was being realised from Hari Behera and Brundu Anukul Singh, two fishermen.
It is not clear from this document in what status they were paying this amount and what was the nature of their tenancy.
Exhibit A is a kabuliyat of the year 1845 by Brundu Anukul Singh and Hari Behera in favour of Babu Mohan Bhagat and Bibi Mobarak Nisa, and it shows that these two fishermen took a lease of the fishing right in Devi river on payment of Rs. 135 as rent, from the landlords.
It was stated there in that these fishermen will catch fish from these waters according to former custom and will pay ""machdia sarbara"" of Rs. 135 in accordance with the instalments.
There is no indication in the kabuliyat that these two persons were executing it in a representative capacity or that the lease taken by them was of a permanent character or 440 that the rent payable was not liable to enhancement in the future.
It was contended on behalf of the defendants that these two persons executed the kabuliyat in a representative capacity and on behalf of all the fishermen who originally resided in four villages of Killa Marichpur and who subse quently came to reside in the nine villages mentioned in the plaint.
The only evidence placed on the record in support of the suggestion and relied upon by the High Court is the statement of D.W. 11 who was born some time in the year 1873, about 28 years after the execution of the kabuliyat and who has no special means of knowledge to depose as to the relationship of persons mentioned in the kabuliyat with the defendants in the present case or to know the capacity of persons who executed the kabuliyat.
It is not possible therefore to hold that the kabuliyat was executed in a representative capacity by these two persons and on behalf of all the persons interested in the present controversy.
There is no evidence on the record to prove the state of affairs of this fishery between the years 1845 and 187 a Reliance was placed by the defendants on a number of rent receipts produced by them in evidence.
The first of these is dated 30th 'March, 1873, and was executed by one of the Mahapatra co sharers on account of the instalment of fishery rent of ""Charkhati"" paid through Hari Behera and Rama Behera in the sum of Rs. 8 12 0.
All the co sharers were not par ties to this receipt and it is not stated what was the total rent payable for the whole fishery.
On the 11th May, 1875, another receipt was executed by Bibi Masudannisa and Others, co sharers of five anna four pies in the zamindari in favour of Hari Behera and Ananta Behera and others for a sum of Rs. 18.
It seems that different co sharers were giving permis sion to different persons to fish in the fishery on payment of certain sums of money.
There is no evidence whatsoever connecting the receipt of 1873 given by two co sharers to two persons with the receipt given by another set of co sharers to these two persons and it is not possible to say that these payments were made towards a fixed 441 rent of Rs. 135 7 0 payable for the whole fishery.
The state of affairs of this fishery between 1876 to 1893 remains shrouded in mystery as no evidence for that period has been filed on the record.
On the 1st May, 1894, Mohan Bhagat 's descendant gave a receipt to Pandab Behera and Phagu Behera for Rs. 10, which was to be set off against fishery rent.
It is difficult to connect this receipt with the other receipts or to treat it as evidence in support of the de fendants ' case of a permanent tenancy.
Similar receipts by different co sharers in favour of different persons were executed on the 1st May, 1895, 5th May, 1896, 9th May, 1897, and 22nd October, 1899; but in none of those receipts is any mention made of any fixed rental of Rs. 135 7 O for the fishery in respect of the whole year and payable to all the landlords.
A printed rent receipt on behalf of one of the proprietors to Hurshi Behera and Agani Behera of village Alsahi was given on the 22nd October, 1899.
The receipt relates to payment of twelve annas as arrears of fishery rent and in the receipt it is stated that the cash rent payable was Rs. 150.
This receipt, if it relates to the rent payable to all the co sharers, is inconsistent with the defendants ' case that the fishery had been leased out from time immemorial on a fixed rent of Rs. 135 7 0.
On the 23rd August, 1902, a receipt was given on behalf of nine anna seven pie co sharers in the zamindari to Maguni Behera and Ram Behera of Kalia Kona and to Sapani Behera of some other village in the sum of Rs. 83 12 11 stating that the amount of total rent of which Rs. 83 12 11 was the fractional share of these landlords was a sum of Rs. 135 7 0.
It was contend ed on behalf of the defendants that the sum of Rs. 135 7 0 mentioned in this receipt was the identical amount that was mentioned in the jamabandi of 1842 as payable to the zamin dars as income of the jalker and from this entry an infer ence should be drawn that the fishery had been continuously leased for this sum from 1842 to the date of this receipt.
The coincidence relied upon undoubtedly exists, but on that basis it is not possible to draw the reference suggested as such an inference would be 442 of a conjectural nature.
All these receipts are consist ent with the contention of the plaintiff that from time to time different co sharers permitted different fishermen to fish in the fishery on payment of a certain rental.
A re ceipt similar to the one above mentioned was also executed on the 5th March, 1906, by certain co sharers owning eight pies in the zamindari in favour of some fishermen, the annual rent being Rs. 135 7 0.
The ""Remarks Column"" states that if the rent is more than mentioned therein, the further amount due would be made good.
Same remarks are applicable to this receipt as to the previous one.
The next rent re ceipt is dated 19th April, 1907, and is for a sum of Rs. 168 6 0.
No inference either way can be drawn from this receipt.
On the 21st June, 1912, a receipt was given in favour of twelve persons in respect of rent for the year 1317.
The receipt was given by the nine anna seven pie co sharer in the zamindari but it is not clear how this amount was made up.
On the 4th February, 1914, a receipt was given by an eight pie co sharer in the zamindari to 174 persons, described as tenants and residing in different villages of the zamindari for a sum of Rs. 5 13 6 as rent for the year 1319.
The entry in the ""Remarks"" column is similar to the receipt above mentioned.
The amount of annual rent is mentioned as Rs. 135 7 0 and it is stated that it is being paid in accordance with a decree of court No. 181.
It is difficult to connect this receipt with the other documents previously discussed.
Another receipt dated 30th March, 1914, was given by nine anna seven pie co sharers in the fishery to twelve persons for the year 1320.
It seems to us that these occasional receipts given to different persons by different sets of co sharers can lead to no definite conclu sion in regard to the rights of the parties.
They are con sistent with the case argued on behalf of the plaintiff that by leave and licence a number of fishermen used to fish in ' the waters from time to time and they do not necessarily lead to the inference of the existence of a permanent tenan cy of the fishery in favour of the defendants on a fixed rent of Rs. 135 7 0.
443 By a registered deed dated 24th May, 1914, the plaintiff for the first time acquired an eight pie interest in the zamindari in the name of Smt.
Mahisthali Patamahadei, his wife, from one Balaram Das Bhagat, a descendant of Mohan Bhagat.
Subsequently he in his own name and sometimes in the name of the Rani purchased some further shares in the za mindari and eventually became the owner of seven anna seven pie and ten kranth share in it.
The acquisition of interest by the plaintiff (Raja of Aul) in the zamindari coincides with the period of the first world war, the aftermath of which was a rise in prices.
Fish which was a cheap commodity and brought no appreciable income to the fishermen or to the owners became a source of considerable income and this circumstance led to disputes between the owners of the fishery and the fishermen.
A number of letters of the years 1914 to 1918 have been proved on behalf of the plaintiff showing that he was deriving income from this fishery.
Similar letters for subsequent periods have also been proved but no regular accounts of the income so realized were produced in the case.
The enhanced income of the fishery created a scramble for its possession between the landlords and the fishermen and there was an apprehension of a breach of peace which resulted in proceedings under section 145, Criminal Procedure Code.
A report was made to the police on the 11th February, 1918, that a dispute had arisen which was likely to cause a breach of the peace between the landlords of Killa Marichpur and twelve fishermen in regard to the possession of Charikhati fisheries in Debi river.
The Magis trate on receipt of the police report issued notice to the parties for the 10th February, 1018, and decided the case on the 10th June, 1918.
From his order it appears that notice was given to all concerned and they were invited to put their respective claims as regards the facts of the actual possession of the fishery in dispute before him.
On behalf of certain co sharers evidence was led to prove that they were in possession of the fishery through one Sundari Behera and other fishermen numbering about 100.
The Rani 444 of Aul who had then eight pie interest in the zamindari as benamidar of her husband led evidence to establish that she was in possession of the fishery through fishermen employed by her agent.
Ram Behera, Hrushi Behera and other fishermen of the second party, twelve in number, led evidence to show that they were in possession of the fishery on payment of rent and that the owners of the zamindari had never been in actual possession of the fishery.
The Magistrate found that this contention was true.
He disbelieved the story of the witnesses produced by the Rani of Aul, and also rejected the testimony of the witnesses produced by other owners.
Some Aul fishermen were produced on behalf of the Rani but their evidence was also not accepted.
The same kind of documentary evidence that has been placed on this record on behalf of the plaintiff was also placed before the Magistrate but it was not accepted by him.
From these proceedings, it further appears that all the sixteen anna owners of Killa Marichpur issued a notice to the second party, the fishermen, for surrendering possession of the fishery with effect from September, 1917, but after service of notice they took no legal steps to eject them from possession of the fishery; on the other hand, they took the law into their own hands and made attempts to take forcible possession of the fishery.
These attempts, however, were unsuccessful.
The result of these proceedings was that the Magistrate found that the fishermen (the second party) were in possession of the disputed fishery and he directed ' the issue of an order declaring their possession until evicted therefrom in due course of law and forbidding all disturbance of such posses sion until such eviction.
This order indicates that though all the landlords were not named as parties in the case, yet all of them had notice of the proceedings and all of them were actually interested in turning out the fishermen from possession by forcible means, and notice had been given to them on behalf of all of them.
It also appears from those proceedings that though one dozen people were named as second party in the case, there were certain other persons also interested in the 445 fishery along with them, but it is difficult to ascertain their number, names and addresses from these proceedings.
Evidence has been led on behalf of the plaintiff to prove that after the determination of these proceedings the plain tiff has been deriving income from this fishery by leasing his right through the agency of fishermen of Aul.
The High Court has not placed any reliance on this evidence and, in our opinion, rightly.
It is not possible to believe that after a successful fight in the criminal court, the fisher men would have allowed the men of the Raja or of the Rani to fish in these waters during the Hilsa season.
Both parties led oral evidence to prove that each party exercised exclu sive right of fishing during Hilsa season in the fishery.
We have been taken through the evidence and after examining it, have reached the conclusion that it is of an unsatisfactory character and valuable rights cannot be decided on its footing.
No steps were taken by the landlords to question the order of the Magistrate within three years from its date as required by article 47 of the Limitation Act.
The land lords, however, refused to receive any rent from these persons after the termination of the proceedings and they have been depositing it in court under the provisions of the Orissa Tenancy Act.
The last purchase by the Raja of Aul of some interest in the zamindari was made in the year 1935 and having acquired by this date a substantial interest in it and having discov ered that the fishery was a paying proposition, he brought this suit in the year 1986 on the allegations set out above and asserted that since about three years the defendants had started disturbing his possession of the fishery in dispute.
In the circumstances mentioned above this assertion cannot be taken seriously.
In order to get out of the effects of the proceedings under section 145, Criminal Procedure Code, he alleged that he had been in possession of the fishery in spite of the proceedings taken under that section and that his possession had only been disturbed recently.
The evi dence on this point was 446 rejected by the High Court and we see no reason to disagree with that finding.
It is now convenient to consider the different points canvassed before us by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the parties.
We find it difficult to uphold the view of the High Court that the defendants were in posses sion of the disputed fishery under a lost grant.
This doc trine has no application to the case of inhabitants of particular localities seeking to establish rights of User to some piece of land or water.
As pointed out by Lord Rad cliffe in Lakshmidhar Misra vs Rangalal(1) the doctrine of lost grant originated as a technical device to enable title to be made by prescription despite the impossibility of proving immemorial user and that since it originated in grant, its owners, whether original or by devolution, had to be such persons as were capable of being the recipients of a grant, and that a right exercisable by the inhabitants of a village from time to time is neither attached to any estate in land nor is it such a right as is capable of being made the subject of a grant, there being no admissible grantees.
Reference in this connection may be made to a Bench decision of the Calcutta High Court in Asrabulla vs Kiamatulla(2), wherein the law on this subject has been examined in some detail.
In that case the question arose whether the right of pasturage claimed by a whole body of villagers could be acquired by grant, express or presumed.
After an examination a number of English and Indian cases it was held that no lost grant could be presumed in favour of a fluctuating and unascertained body of persons who constitute the inhabitants of a village and that such a right could only be acquired by custom.
The defendants in this case are a fluctuating body of persons and their number increases or decreases by each birth or death or by influx or efflux of fishermen to or from these villages.
From the evidence of D.W. 11 it appears that formerly the Kouts (fishermen) claiming the right to fish were residents of four villages, then some of them shifted to other villages on account of their (1) A.I.R. 1950 P.C. 56.
(2) A.I.R. 1937 Cal.
447 houses being washed away, and settled themselves in other villages.
At the time of the suit they were residing in nine villages.
He further deposed that during the last ten or twelve years there were 600 bohanias and that their families increased, their present number being 846.
It is in evidence that since this evidence was given their number has gone up to 1500.
From the documentary evidence it appears that up to the year 1918 their number was not very large.
Only twelve persons were impleaded in the section 145, Criminal Procedure Code, proceedings and it was said that there were some more interested.
The maximum number given in one or two receipts is 174.
It is again not possible to hold that the fishermen residing in these villages are a corporate body and that being fishermen by profession it has the effect of incorpo rating them.
We find ourselves unable to subscrib","A right exercisable by the inhabitants of a village from time to time is neither attached to any estate in land nor is it such a right as is capable of being made the subject of a grant, there being no ascertainable grantees.
The doctrine of lost grant originated as a technical device to enable title to be made by prescription despite the impossibility of proving immemorial user and since it originated in grant, its owners, whether original or by devolution, had to be such persons as were capable of being the recipients of a grant.
Where all that appeared from the evidence was that the fishermen who were residents of certain villages had been for a long time exercising the right of fishing in certain rivers which flowed through a zemindari with the consent of some of the zemindars: Held, that the fishermen residing in these villages cannot be treated as a corporate body or a kind of unit in whose favour a lost grant could be presumed or who could acquire a right to fish either by adverse possession or by prescription.
Where, however, there were proceedings under section 145 of the Criminal Procedure Code between the zemindars and certain fishermen and the Magistrate found that the fisher men were in possession of the disputed fishery and he di rected the issue of an order declaring their possession until evicted therefrom in due course of law and forbidding all disturbance of such possession until such eviction, and no steps were taken by the zemindars to set aside the order of the Magistrate within three years as required by article 47 of the Limitation Act: Held.
, that so far as the fisher men who were parties to the proceedings under section 145, the order of the Magistrate had become final and they were entitled to remain in possession of the fishery.
An exclusive right of fishing in a given place means that no other person has a co extensive right with the claimant of the right.
The mere fact that some other person has a right to a particular class of fish in the fishery or that another person is 56 432 entitled to fish at a certain time of the year does not destroy the right of exclusive fishing in any manner.

36.txt,"ppeal (Civil Appeal No. 57 of 1950) from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 1st April, 1948, in Appeal No. :365 of 1947 reversing a judgment of the Joint Civil Judge at Ahmedabad, dated 14th October, 1947, in Suit No. 174 of 1945.
B. Somayya (Jindra Lal, with him) for the appel lants.
C.K. Daphtary (Sri Narain Andley, with him) for the respondents.
February 23.
The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MAHAJAN J.
The appellants are owners of a property known as ""Bharat Bhuvan Theatre"" at Ahmedabad.
The respond ents are the lessees of the said theatre.
The term of the lease was to expire on the 2nd 222 December, 1945, unless the lessees gave to the land lords three months previous notice in writing of their intention of exercising their option of renewal of the lease for a further period of two years.
On the 13th December, 1945, the appellants filed the suit out of which this appeal arises for ejectment of the respondents and for recovery of certain amounts.
This suit was decreed on the 14th October, 1947, on the following findings: (1) that the respondents had not exercised the option of the renewal of the lease according to the stipulations contained in the lease, (2) that they had committed breaches of the terms of the lease, and (3) that they were not protected by the Rent Restriction Act.
An enquiry was directed into the amount of mesne prof its.
The respondents filed an append in the High Court against the decree of the Joint Civil Judge on the 10th November, 1947.
The appeal was heard by a Bench of the High Court (Weston and Dixit JJ.) on the 26th February, 1948, and was decided on the 1st April, 1948.
The judgment and decree of the Joint Civil Judge were reversed and the plaintiff 's suit was dismissed.
The High Court affirmed the finding of the trial court on the first point and held in agreement with it that the respondents had not proved that they gave three months previous notice in writing to the appellants for renewal of the lease as required by clause 4 (2) of the lease.
It reversed the finding of the trial Judge on the point that the respondents had committed breaches of the terms contained in clause 2 (20) of the lease.
Finally, it reached the conclusion that although the decree appealed from was right on the date it was made, yet in view of the altered circumstances created by reason of coming into operation of Act LVII of 1947 the appellants were not enti tled to recovery of possession of the suit premises.
Being aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court, the appellants obtained a certificate and filed an appeal in this court on the 7th March, 1949, and it is now before us for decision.
It was contended before the High Court that the appeal being in the nature of a rehearing, it should be 223 decided in accordance with the provisions of Act LVII of 1947 which came into force on the 13th February, 1948, and not in accordance with the provisions of the Act in force at the time when the decree was passed by the trial court.
In other words, the contention was that there having been a change in the law after the date of the decree passed by the trial Judge and before the appeal was heard, the rights of the parties should be determined in accordance with the law as it stood on the date of the hearing of the appeal.
The High Court gave effect to this contention and set aside the decree made for ejectment of the respondents.
Learned counsel for the appellants challenged the deci sion of the High Court before us on three grounds: (1) that assuming that the appeal had to be decided by the High Court in accordance with the provisions of Act LVII of 1947, the provisions of that Act had no application to pending ap peals which had been excluded from its ambit; (9,)that Act LVII of 1947 had been amended by Bombay Act III of 1949 and that the appeal pending in this court should be decided in accordance with the provisions of the amended Act which excluded pending appeals from the purview of Act LVII of 1947; and (3) that the High Court wrongly reversed the trial court 's finding that the respondents had committed breaches of the terms contained in clause 2 (20) of the lease.
The learned counsel for the respondents besides controverting the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants contended that both the courts had erred in holding that the respondents had not proved that they exer cised the option of renewal of the lease according to the stipulations contained therein.
In our opinion, the decision of the appeal depends solely on the construction of sections 12 and 50 of Act LVII of 1947.
The question to decide is whether the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, LVII of 1947, which was enacted on the 19th January, 1948, and which came into force on the 13th February, 1948, has applica tion to 29 224 pending appeals or whether its retrospective effect is limited to cases mentioned in section 50 of the Act.
The point whether the option of renewal was exercised according to the covenants of the lease is concluded by a concurrent finding of fact and nothing that Mr. Daphthary said in support of his contention in any way shakes that finding.
The case must therefore be decided on the assump tion that the respondents did not exercise the option given to them under the lease for its renewal.
We are also not impressed with the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants that the High Court wrongly reversed the finding of the trial Judge on the point that the respondents commit ted breaches of the terms of the tease.
We should not howev er be taken to concur in all the reasons given by the High Court for reversing that finding.
Whether the High Court was right in holding that the provisions of Act LVII of 1947 have application to appeals pending at the time when that Act came into force; the answer to this question depends on the construction to be placed on sections 12 and 50 of Act LVII of 1947.
Section 12 of the Act is in these terms: "" (1) A landlord shall not be entitled to the recovery of possession of any premises so long as the tenant pays, or is ready and willing to pay, the amount of the standard rent and permitted increases, if any, and observes and performs the other conditions of the tenancy, in so far as they are consistent with the provisions of this Act.
(2) No suit for recovery of possession shall be insti tuted by a landlord against a tenant on the ground of non payment of the standard rent or permitted increases due, until the expiration of one month next after notice in writing of the demand of the standard rent or permitted increases has been served upon the tenant in the manner provided in section 106 of the .
(3) No decree for eviction shall be passed in any such suit if, at the hearing.
of the suit, the tenant pays or tenders in court the standard rent or permitted increases then due together with the costs of the suit.
225 Explanation In any case where there is a dispute as to the amount of standard rent or permitted increases recovera ble under this Act the tenant shall be deemed to be ready and willing to pay such amount if, before the expiry of the period of one month after notice referred to in sub section (2), he makes an application to the court under sub section (3) of section 11 and thereafter pays or tenders the amount or rent or permitted increases specified in the order made by the court.
"" This is the substantive section giving protection to the tenant against ejectment.
Section 50 which occurs in dealing with miscellaneous matters is the repeal section.
It repeals the Act of 1939 and the Act of 1944, and while repealing these statutes it provides as follows: ""Provided that all suits and proceedings (other than execution proceedings and appeals) between a landlord and a tenant relating to the recovery or fixing of rent or posses sion of any premises to which the provisions of apply and all suits and proceedings by a manager of a hotel or an owner of a lodging house against a lodger for the recovery of charges for, or possession of, the accommodation provided in a hotel or lodging house situate in an area to which applies, which are pending in any Court, shall be transferred to and continued before the courts which would have jurisdiction to try such suits or proceed ings under this Act, and thereupon all the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder shall apply to all such suits and proceedings.
Provided further that (a) every order passed or act done by the Control lers under of the Bombay Rents, Hotel Rates and Lodging House Rates (Control) Act, 1944, and every order or act deemed to have been passed or done under that Part shall be deemed to have been passed or done under this Act; and (b) all proceedings pending before the Controllers under Part IV of that Act shall be transferred to and continued before the Controllers appointed under this 226 Act as if they were proceedings instituted before the Con trollers under this Act"" The High Court held that section 50 merely provided for transfer of pending suits and proceedings to courts given jurisdiction under the Act to hear them and that from its ambit execution proceedings and appeals were excluded be cause no question could arise of their being transferred from one court to another and that an appeal being a contin uation of the suit and in the nature of a re hearing, the provisions of section 12 should be applied to pending ap peals.
The opinion expressed by the Division Bench on the construction of sections 12 and 50 of the Act was questioned in Nilkanth vs Rasiklal (J), and the matter was referred to a Full Bench.
The Full Bench overruled the decision reached by the Division Bench on the construction of section 50 and observed that it was clear that in terms the provi sions of the new Act and the rules made thereunder are made to apply only to such suits and proceedings which are trans ferred under the provisions of this section and that its retrospective effect is confined to what is expressly stated in section 50 of the Act.
We are in respectful agreement with the view expressed by the Full Bench.
On a plain reading of the language of sections 12 and 50 it seems clear to us that the Act was given retrospective operation only to a limited extent and execution proceedings and appeals were excluded from this effect and were to be governed by the provisions of the law in force at the time when the decrees were passed.
The concluding words of section 50 ""and there upon all the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder shall apply to all such suits and proceedings"" fully bear out this construction.
Mr. Daphthary contended that the whole object of section 50 was to make provision for transfer of pending cases to courts which were given jurisdiction under the Act to hear them and the section did not concern itself with the extent of the retrospective operation of the Act, and that section 12 of the Act which gives protection to tenants should (1) A. I. R. 227 be construed as having retrospective effect.
In our opinion this contention is not sound.
Section 50 cannot be de scribed as a section providing merely for transfer of pend ing cases to courts having jurisdiction to deal with them.
It is on the other hand a"" repeal"" section in the new stat ute.
It repeals the two earlier statutes, and while repeal ing them it provides that the repeal shall not affect ""executions and appeals"" and that the provisions of the Act shall apply to all pending suits which shall be transferred to the courts having jurisdiction to hear them under section 28 of the Act.
We are also inclined to agree with the view of the Full Bench that section 12 is in terms prospective and not retrospective.
Sub section (2) clearly relates to suits which may be instituted after the Act comes into force.
It cannot apply to suits which were already pending when the Act was put on the statute book.
Sub section (3) which gives the right to the tenant to pay or tender the rent at the hearing of the suit only applies to those suits which may be instituted after the Act comes into operation because it in terms states ""in such suit"" and not ""in any suit"".
""Such suit"" can only be a suit referred to in subsec tions (2) and (3) of section 12.
The result therefore is that, in our opinion, the High Court erroneously applied the provisions of Act LVII of 1947 to the appeal in this case and was wrong in allowing it on that basis.
In this view of the case it is unnecessary to deal with the alternative argument of the learned counsel that this appeal should be decided in accordance with the provisions of Act III of 1949.
We accordingly set aside the decree of the High Court dismissing the plaintiff 's suit and restore the decree of the trial Judge decreeing the plain tiff 's suit with costs.
Appeal allowed.
","The Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, LVII of 1947, which came into force on the 13th Febru ary, 1948, has no application to appeals which were pending at the time when the Act came into force.
Its retrospective effect is limited to cases mentioned in section 50 of the Act, that is to say, to suits and proceedings which were trans ferred under the provisions of the said section to the courts having jurisdiction under the Act.
Section 12 of the said Act is in terms prospective and not retrospective in effect.
Sub section (2) relates to suits which may be instituted after the Act comes into force and sub section
(3) also only applies to such suits.

April 6.
The following judgments were deliv ered.
PATANJALI SASTRI J. These three petitions have been pre sented to this Court under article 32 of the Constitution of India praying for the issue of writs in the nature of habeas corpus for release of the petitioners who are respectively the President, VicePresident and Secretary of the Hindu Mahasabha of the Delhi State.
The petitioners were arrested on 22nd August, 1950, by order of the District Magistrate, Delhi, made under sub section (2) read with clause (a) sub clause (i) of sub section (1) of section 3 of the (hereinafter referred to as the Act).
The order ran as follows: ""Whereas I, Rameshwar Dayal, District Magistrate, Delhi, am satisfied that with a view to the maintenance of public order in Delhi it is necessary to do so, I, Rameshwar Dayal, District Magistrate, Delhi, hereby order the detention of . . under sub section (2) of section 3 (1) (a) (ii) of the .
Given under my seal and signature"".
The grounds of detention communicated to the petitioners were in identical terms, save as to the dates on which the speeches were said to have been made, and read thus: ""In pursuance of section 7 of the you are hereby informed that the grounds on which the detention order dated 22nd August, 1950, has been made against you are that your speeches generally in the past and particularly on .
August, 454 1950, at public meetings in Delhi has been such as to excite disaffection between Hindus and Muslims and thereby preju dice the maintenance of public order in Delhi and that in order to prevent you from making such speeches it is neces sary to make the said order"".
The petitioners applied to the High Court at Simla for similar relief under article 226 of the Constitution, but the petitions were dismissed.
It appears to have been con tended before the learned Judges (Khosla and Falshaw JJ.) who heard those petitions that although this Court held in A.K. Gopalan vs The State of Madras (1) that the provisions of section 3 of the Act were constitutional and valid, detention under that section was ultra vires and illegal where, as here, it was based on the ground of making speech es prejudicial to the security of the State or the mainte nance of public order.
This was said to be the result of the later pronouncements of this Court in Brij Bhushan and Another vs The State of Delhi (2) and Romesh Thappar vs The State of Madras (3).
This contention was rejected on the ground that no such proviso could be read into section 3 on the strength of the later decisions referred to above which related to a different point, viz., the scope of authorised restrictions on the right to freedom of speech conferred by article 19 (1).
Falshaw J. (with whom Khosla J. concurred), proceeded, however, to draw attention to what he conceived to be an ' 'anomaly ' ' while a State Government should not be allowed to interfere with the freedom of the press by way of stopping the circulation of newspapers or by pre censor ship of news, the Government should, for the same object, be entitled to place a person under preventive detention which is ""even greater restriction on personal liberty than any restriction on a newspaper ever could be"".
This distinction appeared to the learned Judge to be illogical, and he thought that there was ""an apparent conflict"" between the decisions of this Court in Gopalan 's case (1) and the other cases, which could only be resolved by this Court.
""It (1) ; (3) ; , (2) ; 455 would be well"" the learned Judge concluded ""if the point were raised in this form at an early date in the Supreme Court"".
No wonder that, after this encouragement, the peti tioners have preferred these petitions raising the same contention before us.
On behalf of the petitioners Mr. Hardy submitted that the provisions of the Act should not be used to prevent a citizen from making speeches though they might be considered to be prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, for maintenance of public order is not a purpose for which imposition of a restriction on freedom of speech is authorised by the Constitution, as held by this Court in the Cross roads(1) and the Organizer(2) cases.
It is true that in those cases this Court decided by a majority of 5 to 1 that ""unless a law restricting freedom of speech and expression is directed solely against the undermining of the security of the State or the overthrow of it such law cannot fall within the reservation of clause (2) of article 19 although the restrictions which it seeks to impose may have been conceived generally in the interests of public order"".
But it will be noticed that the Statutory provi sions which were there declared void and unconstitutional authorised the imposition, in the one case, of a ban on the circulation of a newspaper and, in the other, of pre censor ship on the publication of a journal.
No question arose of depriving any person of his personal liberty by detaining him in custody, whereas here, as in Gopalan 's case(s), the Court is called upon to adjudge the legality of the deten tion of the petitioners with a view to prevent them from making speeches prejudicial to the maintenance of public order Although personal liberty has a content sufficiently comprehensive to include the freedoms enumerated in article 19 (1), and its deprivation would result in the extinction of those freedoms, the Constitution has treated these civil liberties as distinct fundamental rights and made separate provisions in article 19 and articles 21 and 22 as to the limitations and conditions subject to which (1) ; (3) ; (2) ; 59 456 alone they could be taken away or abridged.
The interpreta tion of these articles and their correlation were elaborate ly dealt with by the full Court in Gopalan 's case(1).
The question arose whether section 3 of the Act was a law impos ing restrictions on ""the right to move freely throughout the territory of India"" guaranteed under article 19 (1) (d) and, as such, was liable to be tested with reference to its reasonableness under clause (5) of that article.
It was decided by a majority of 5 to 1 that a law which authorises deprivation of personal liberty did not fall within the purview of article 19 and its validity was not to be judged by the criteria indicated in that article but depended on its compliance with the requirements of articles 21 and 22, and as section 3 satisfied those requirements, it was con stitutional.
If the learned Judges in the High Court had paid close attention to the judgments delivered in this Court, they would have found that there was nothing illogi cal in that view and no conflict between the decisions in that case and in the other cases to which reference has been made.
The observations of the Chief Justice in Gopalan 's case(1) make the position quite clear: "" As the preventive detention order results in the deten tion of the applicant in a cell it was contended on his behalf that the rights specified in article 19 (1) (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g)have been infringed.
It was argued that because of his detention he cannot have a free right to speech as and where he desired and the same argument was urged in respect of the rest of the rights mentioned in sub clauses (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g).
Although this argument is advanced in a case which deals with preventive detention, if correct, it should be applicable in the case of punitive detention also, to any one sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the relevant section of the Indian Penal Code.
So considered, the argument must clearly be rejected.
In spite of the saving clauses (2) to (6), permit ting abridgement of the rights connected with each of them, punitive detention under several sections of the Penal Code, e.g., for theft, cheating, forgery and even (1) ; 457 ordinary assault, will be illegal.
Unless such conclusion necessarily follows from the article, it is obvious that such construction should be avoided.
In my opinion, such result is clearly not the outcome of the Constitution.
The article has to be read without any preconceived notions.
So read, it clearly means that the legislation to be examined must be directly in respect of one of the rights mentioned in the sub clauses.
If there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen 's freedom of speech or expression, or his right to assemble peaceably and without arms, etc., the question whether that legislation is saved by the relevant saving clause of article 19 will arise.
If, however, the legislation is not directly in respect of any of these subjects, but as a result of the operation of other legislation, for instance, for punitive or preventive deten tion, his right under any of these sub clauses is abridged, the question of the application of article 19 does not arise.
The true approach is only to consider the directness of the legislation and not what will be the result of the detention otherwise valid, on the mode of the detenu 's life.
On that short ground, in my opinion, this argument about the infringement of the rights mentioned in article 19 (1) generally must fail.
Any other construction put on the article, it seems to me, will be unreasonable.
""(1) Similar conclusions expressed by the other learned Judges will be found at pages 194, 229, 256 and 305.
It follows that the petitions now before us are governed by the decision in Gopalan 's case(1), notwithstanding that the petitioners ' right under article 19 (1)(a) is abridged as a result of their detention under the Act.
The anomaly, if anomaly there be in the resulting position, is inherent in the structure and language of the relevant articles, whose meaning and effect as expounded by this Court by an over whelming majority in the cases referred to above must now be taken to be settled law, and courts in this country will be serving no useful purpose by discovering supposed conflicts and illogicalities and recommending parties to re agitate the points thus settled.
(1) ; , 100 101.
458 Mr. Hardy next contended that, in view of the recent decision of this Court in The State of Bombay vs Atma Ram Sridhar Vaidya(1), the grounds of detention communicated to each of the petitioners must be held to be too vague and indefinite to enable them to make their ""representations"" to the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, and the requirements of clause (5)of article 22 not having thus been complied with, the petitioners were entitled to be set at liberty.
Accord ing to Mr. Hardy it was not sufficient that the time and place of the alleged speeches and their general effect were indicated, but it was also necessary that the offending passages or at least the gist of them should be communicated in order to enable the petitioners to make effective repre sentations.
In the case relied on, this Court, no doubt, held by a majority that, though the first part of article 22 (s), which casts an obligation on the detaining authority to communicate the grounds of the order of detention would be sufficiently complied with if the"" deductions or conclusions of facts from facts"" on which the order was based were disclosed, the latter part of the clause, which confers on the person detained the right of making a ""representation"" against the order, imposed, by necessary implication, a duty on the authority to furnish the person with further particu lars to enable him to make his representation.
It was further held that the sufficiency of this ""second communica tion"" of particulars was a justiciable issue, the test being whether ""it is sufficient to enable the detained person to make a representation which, on being considered, may give relief to the detained person.
"" While the communication of particulars should, subject to a claim of privilege under clause (6), be"" as full and adequate as the circumstances permit"", it did not, however, follow from clause (6) that ""what is not stated or considered to be withheld on that ground must be disclosed and if not disclosed there is a breach of a fundamental right.
A wide latitude is left to the authorities in the matter of disclosure."" Referring to the use of the term (1) ; 459 ""vague"" in this connection,.
it was remarked: ""If on reading the ground furnished it is capable of being intelligently understood and is sufficiently definite to furnish materials to enable the detained person to make a representation against the order of detention, it cannot be called vague"" This decision does not, in our opinion, support the broad proposition contended for by Mr. Hardy that wherever an order of detention is based upon speeches made by the person sought to be detained, the detaining authority should communicate to the person the offending passages or at least the gist of such passages on pain of having the order quashed if it did not.
In the cases now before us the time and place at which the speeches were alleged to have been made were specified and their general nature and effect (being such as to excite disaffection between Hindus and Muslims) was also stated.
It is difficult to see how the communication of particular passages or their substance one of the petitioners denied having made any speech on the day specified was necessary in addition to the particulars already given, to enable the petitioners to make their representations.
It should be remembered in this connection that the Court is not called upon in this class of cases to judge whether or not the speech or speeches in question constituted a prejudicial act falling within the purview of section 3 of the Act as it is called upon in prosecutions for offences under section 124A or section 153A of the Indian Penal Code to find whether the speech attributed to the accused person constituted an offence under those sec tions.
That is a matter for the detaining authority to be satisfied about.
Nor do these cases belong to the category where a reference had to be made to the Advisory Board under the Act, so that any attempt by the petitioners to rebut the inference drawn by the detaining authority from their speeches had to be made only before the executive authori ties.
In such circumstances the suggestion that without the communication of the offending passages or their substance the petitioners were not in a position to make their repre sentations 460 to the executive authorities sounds unreal and is devoid of substance.
It may be possible to conceive of peculiar situations where perhaps the person detained on ground of prejudicial speeches might be in a better position to make a representation if he was given the objectionable passages or the gist of them, but the present cases are not of such peculiar character.
On the other hand, cases have come before this Court where speeches were alleged to have been made after midnight at secret gatherings of kisans and workers inciting them to violence, crime and disorder.
Such allegations could only be based in most cases on information received by the executive authorities from confidential sources and it would not be practicable in all such cases to have a record made of the speeches delivered.
To hold that article 22 (5) requires that, wherever detention is grounded on alleged prejudicial speeches, the detaining authority should indicate to the person detained the passages which it regards as objectionable would rob the provisions of the Act of much of their usefulness in the very class of cases where those provisions were doubtless primarily intended to be used and where their use would be most legitimate.
In the case of these petitioners, no doubt, the speeches are said to have been made at public meetings, and it is not suggest ed on behalf of the respondents that no record was made of the speeches, so that the details asked for could have been furnished.
The omission to do so, for which no reason is disclosed in these proceedings, is regrettable, as it has given rise to avoidable grievance and complaint.
The au thorities who feel impelled in discharge of their duty to issue orders of detention will do well to bear in mind the following remarks of the Chief Justice in the case referred to above: ""In numerous cases that have been brought to our notice, we have found that there has been quite an unnecessary obscurity on the part of the detaining authority in stating the grounds for the order.
Instead of giving the information with reasonable details, there is a deliberate attempt to use the minimum number 461 of words in the communication conveying the grounds of detention.
In our opinion, this attitude is quite deplora ble"".
This, however, does not affect our conclusion in these cases that the grounds communicated to the petitioners contain sufficient particulars to enable them to make their representations to the authority concerned, and that the requirements of article 22 (5) have thus been complied with.
It is also urged that the orders of detention were bad because they did not specify the period during which the petitioners were to be under detention.
This point is now concluded against the petitioners by the decision of this Court in Ujager Singh vs The State of Punjab (1) and Jagjit Singh vs The State of Punjab (2) where it was pointed out that as section 12 of the Act itself prescribed a maximum period of one year for detention thereunder, such orders could not be said to be of indefinite duration and unlawful on that ground.
Lastly, it was said that the petitioners were prominent members of a political organisation which was opposed to the ideals and policies of the party in power, and that the orders of detention were made ""for the collateral purpose of stifling effective political opposition and legitimate criticism of the policies pursued by the Congress Party and had nothing to do with the maintenance of public order"".
Allegations of mala fide conduct are easy to make but not always as easy to prove.
The District Magistrate has, in his affidavit filed in these proceedings, stated that, from the materials placed before him by persons experienced in investigating matters of this kind, he was satisfied that it was necessary to detain the petitioners with a view to preventing them from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, and he has emphatically repudi ated the purpose and motive imputed to him.
We have thus allegations on the one side and denial on the other, and the petitioners made no attempt to discharge the burden, which undoubtedly lay upon them, to prove that the District (1) Petition No. 149 of 1950.
(2) Petition No. 167 of 1950.
462 Magistrate acted mala fide in issuing the orders of deten tion.
The petitions are dismissed.
MAHAJAN J.
These three petitions under article 82 of the Constitution of India were presented by Prof. Ram Singh, Bal Raj Khanna and Ram Nath Kalia, all three of whom were arrested and placed in detention on the 22nd August, 1950, under the orders of the District Magistrate of Delhi, under the .
The petitioners are respectively, the President, Vice President and the Secre tary of the Delhi State Hindu Mahasabha.
The grounds of detention supplied to them are almost identical.
Those furnished to Prof. Ram Singh read as follows : ""In pursuance of section 7 of the , you are hereby informed that the grounds on which the detention order dated August 22, 1950, has been made against you are that your speeches generally in the past and partic ularly on the 13th and 15th August, 1950, at public meetings in Delhi have been such as to excite disaffection between Hindus and Muslims and thereby prejudice the maintenance of public order in Delhi and that in order to prevent you from making such speeches it is necessary to make the said order.
You are further informed that you are entitled to make a representation against your detention to the State Govern ment, that is, the Chief Commissioner, Delhi.
"" The grounds supplied to the other two petitioners were the same except that in the case of Bal Raj Khanna only the 15th August, 1950, is mentioned as the date on which the public speech was made, and in the case of the third petitioner, it is only the 13 th August, 1950.
Mr. Hardy on behalf of the petitioners.
inter alia urged that the grounds served on the petitioners as justifying the orders of detention are quite indefinite and are not suffi cient to enable them to make an effective representation to the State Government against 463 their detention and that being so, their detention is ille gal.
An affidavit of the District Magistrate was placed before us at the hearing of the cases stating that he was satisfied that the petitioners ' speeches generally, and particularly those made on the 13th and 15th August, 1950, at public meetings in Delhi had been such as to excite disaffection between Hindus and Muslims.
No particulars of the offending words or passages or any indication of the nature of the language employed by the petitioners was mentioned either in the grounds or in this affidavit.
Reference was made to two speeches of the 13th and 15th in the case of the first petitioner and to only one speech delivered on the 13th and 15th respectively by the other two.
So far as the earlier speeches are concerned, it is not even stated on what occasions, on what dates and during what years were those speeches made or delivered.
After a refer ence to the dates of the two speeches, the conclusion drawn by the District Magistrate has been mentioned.
The question for decision is whether what is stated in the grounds is sufficient material on the basis of which the fundamental right conferred on the petitioners by article 22 (5) of the Constitution can be adequately exercised and whether without knowing the substance of the offending passages in the speeches from which the inference has been drawn by the District Magistrate it is possible to prove that this infer ence is not justified.
After considerable thought I have reached the decision that these cases fall within the ambit of the decision of this Court in The State of Bombay vs Atma Ram Shridhar Vaidya (1).
In that case certain general principles ap plicable to cases of this nature were stated by the learned Chief Justice, who delivered the majority judgment, in the following terms: (1) That if the representation has to be intelligible to meet the charges contained in the grounds, the information conveyed to the detained person must (1) ; 60 464 be sufficient to attain that object.
Without getting infor mation sufficient to make a representation against the order of detention it is not possible for the man to make the representation.
Indeed, the right will be only illusory but not a real right at all.
(2) That while there is a connection between the obliga tion on the part of the detaining authority to furnish grounds and the right given to the detained person to have an earliest opportunity to make the representation, the test to be applied in respect of the contents of the grounds for the two purposes is quite different.
For the first, the test is whether it is sufficient to satisfy the authority.
For the second, the test is, whether it is sufficient to enable the detained person to make the representation at the earli est opportunity.
On an infringement of either of these two rights the detained person has a right to approach the court and to complain that there has been an infringement of a fundamental right and even if the infringement of the second part of the right under article 22(5) is established he is bound to be released by the court.
(3) That it cannot be disputed that the representation mentioned in the second part of article 22(5) must be one which on being considered may give relief to the detaining person.
It was pointed out that in the numerous cases that had been brought to the notice of the court it was found that there had been quite an unnecessary obscurity on the part of the detaining authority in stating the grounds for the order, and that instead of giving the information with reasonable details, there is a deliberate attempt to use the minimum number of words in the communication conveying the grounds of detention and that such an attitude was quite deplorable.
In my opinion, these observations have an apposite application to the grounds furnished to the petitioners in the present cases.
The speeches alleged to have been made by the petitioners were made in public meetings and could not be described as of a confidential nature and no privi lege in respect of them was 465 claimed under article 22 (6) of the Constitution.
That being so, the material on the basis of which the District Magistrate drew the inference that these speeches would cause or were likely to cause disaffection amongst Hindus and Muslims should have been communicated to the petitioners so that they may be able to make a representation, which on being considered may give relief to them.
For that purpose either the words used by them or the substance of the speeches should have been communicated to the detenus so that they may be able to prove that such words or passages never formed part of the speeches and have been introduced in them as a result of some error or that no reasonable person could draw an inference from them that those were likely to cause hatred and enmity between the two communi ties.
The sufficiency of the material supplied is a justi ciable issue, though the sufficiency of the grounds on which the detaining authority made up his mind is not a justicia ble issue.
In my opinion, in the absence of any indication in the grounds as to the nature of the words used by the detenus in their speeches from which an inference has been drawn against them they would not be able fully to exercise their fundamental right of making a representation and would not be able to furnish a proper defence to the charge made against them.
Envisaging oneself in the position of a person asked to draw out a written representation on behalf of the detenus on the materials supplied to them, the effort could not proceed beyond a bare denial of the speeches having been made, or a bald statement that no words were used which could possibly excite disaffection between Hindus and Mus lims.
Such a representation would be an idle formality inasmuch as mere denials without any cogent arguments to support them would convince nobody.
Without a knowledge of the offending words or passages, or their substance, it is not possible to argue that the inference drawn is not a legitimate one or to allege that the words used fall within the ambit of legitimate criticism permissible in law and cannot be considered to excite disaffection 466 amongst Hindus and Muslims.
The phraseology employed by the detaining authority in the charge sheet supplied to the detenus seems to have been borrowed from the language used in sections 124A and 153A of the Indian Penal Code.
Judicial literature abounds in cases where words and passages likely to cause disaffection between Hindus and Muslims or which have that effect have been considered and discussed.
In the words objected to were known, the representation on behalf of the detenus could easily have been drawn up with the help of judicial precedents and reasoning considered good in those cases.
Again, without knowing the substance of the offending words from which the inference has been drawn by the detaining authority it is not even possible to urge that these words were merely a quotation from some known author or that the words used fall within legitimate religious propaganda permitted by article 25 of the Constitution or concern the propagation of some political creed to which no objection could be taken.
As regards the two speeches alleged to have been given by the detenus, if the allegation that they were such as to excite disaffection between Hindus and Muslims is correct, the detenus were guilty of the offence under section 153A of the Indian Penal Code and could not only have been punished for the offence under that section but could also have been kept out of harm 's way for the future by that procedure.
A charge sheet under that section or in a trial under section 124A which uses analo gous language would have been defective if it did not men tion the substance of the speeches alleged to have been made by the person charged.
[Vide Chint Ram vs Emperor (1); Chidambaram Pillai vs Emperor(2); Mylapore Krishnaswami vs Emperor(3).] In some of these cases the charge was in substance similar to the charge here.
If a charge in an open trial for an offence under these sections is defective without the substance of the words used or the passages being cited therein, a fortiori, the material supplied in a preventive (1) A.I.R. 1931 Lah. 186.
(3) I.L.R. (2) I.L.R. 467 detention case on a similar charge should be regarded as insufficient when a man has not even a right of being heard in person and has merely to defend himself by means of a written representation.
It has to be remembered in this connection that the phrase ""excite disaffection amongst Hindus and Muslims"" is of a very general nature and an inference of this kind may easily have been drawn on materi al which would not warrant such an inference.
No reason whatsoever has been stated in the affidavit of the District Magistrate for not disclosing the words used by the detenus even after 'this length of time and from which he drew the conclusions on the basis of which he has kept the petition ers under detention for a period well over six months or more.
For the reasons given above I venture to dissent from the opinion of the majority of the Court with great respect and hold that the detention orders above mentioned are illegal.
I accordingly order the release of the petition ers.
On the other points argued in the case I agree with judgment of Sastri J. BOSE J.
I agree with my brother Mahajan whose judgment I have had the advantage of reading, and with the utmost respect find myself unable to accept the majority view.
I am of opinion that these petitioners should all be released on the ground that their detentions are illegal.
I do not doubt the right of Parliament and of the execu tive to place restrictions upon a man 's freedom.
I fully agree that the fundamental rights conferred by the Constitu tion are not absolute.
They are limited.
In some cases the limitations are imposed by the Constitution itself.
In others, Parliament has been given the power to impose fur ther restrictions and in doing so to confer authority on the executive to carry its purpose into effect.
But in every case it is the rights which are fundamental, not the limita tions; and 'it is the duty of this Court and of all courts in the land to guard and defend these rights jealously.
It is our duty and privilege to see that rights which were 468 intended to be fundamental are kept fundamental and to see that neither Parliament nor the executive exceed the bounds within which they are confined by the Constitution when given the power to impose a restricted set of fetters on these freedoms; and in the case of the executive, to see further that it does not travel beyond the powers conferred by Parliament.
We are here to preserve intact for the peo ples of India the freedoms which have now been guaranteed to them and which they have learned through the years to cher ish, to the very fullest extent of the guarantee, and to ensure that they are not whittled away or brought to nought either by Parliamentary legislation or by executive action.
It is the right to personal freedom which is affected here: what the Constitution calls the ""right to move freely throughout the territory of India.
"" Now I do not for a moment deny the right of Parliament to place limitations upon that right and to do it by preventive detention.
Much as all freedom loving persons abhor the thought of locking men and women up without trial and keeping them behind bars indefinitely, the regrettable necessity to do so is to my mind undoubted.
The safety of the State, which is para mount, requires it and, in any event, the Constitution allows it but and this is important subject to limita tions.
So far as the Constitution is concerned, it has given Parliament the power to legislate on this subject by article 246 read with item 9 of List I of the 7th Schedule and item a in List III, and I have no","The District Magistrate of Delhi, ""being satisfied that with a view to the maintenance of public order in Delhi it is necessary to do so"" ordered the detention of the peti tioners under section 3 of the .

"" The petitioners contended that under the Constitu tion the maintenance of public order was not a purpose for which restriction can be imposed on the freedom of 452 speech guaranteed by article 19 (1) and that the grounds commu nicated were too vague and indefinite to enable them to make a representation and the provisions of article 22 (s) of the Constitution were not complied with, and their detention was therefore ultra vires and illegal: Held by the Full Court (KANIA C.J., PATANJALI SASTRI, MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN, S.R.

Consequently, even though a law which restricts freedom of speech and expression which is not directed solely against the undermining of the security of the State or its over throw but is concerned generally in the interests of public order may not fall within the reservation of cl.

Special leave was 323 granted by the Privy Council and the, appeal was originally registered as Privy Council Appeal No. 14 of 1949.
The case was subsequently transferred to the Supreme Court.
K. Bhimasankaran (Durga Bai, with him) for the appel lant.
R. Ganapathi Iyer, for the respondent.
March 19.
The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J.
This appeal, which has been preferred after obtaining special leave to appeal from the Privy Council, is confined to the single question whether mens rea is neces sary to constitute an offence under section 81 of the De fence of India Rules.
The facts of the case are briefly these.
The appellant is the licensee of two petrol filling stations Nos. 552 and 276 at Guntur but is a resident of Chirala, 40 miles away.
He is a Presidency First Class Bench Magistrate at Chirala and manages what has been described as a vast business at several places.
Venkatarayudu and Dadda Pichayya, his employees, were respectively in charge of the aforesaid filling stations.
In 1946, the appellant and his two employ ees were tried before the Sub Divisional Magistrate of Guntur in respect of offences under the Motor Spirit Ration ing Order, 1941, and were convicted in each of the cases on the 18th July, 1946.
In the first case, the charges against the appellant and the employee in charge of the pump in question therein were that they on the 27th June, 1945, at Guntur, supplied petrol to a cars without taking coupons, in contravention of clause 22 read with clause 5 of the said Order promulgated under rule 81 (2) of the Defence of India Rules and that they, on the same day and at the same place, accepted coupons relating to two other cars in advance without supplying petrol, in contravention of clause 27 of the Order.
The charges in the second case were that the appellant and the employee in the second pump similarly supplied during the period of 24 hours from 6 a.m. of the 28th June, 1945, petrol to 4 motor vehicles 324 without taking coupons, in contravention of clause 22 read with clause 5, accepted coupons of three other vehicles in advance without issuing petrol, in contravention of clause 27, and supplied petrol to two other vehicles against cou pons but without making necessary endorsements and particu lars on the reverse of the coupons infringing thereby clause 27A of the said Order.
The Sub Divisional Magistrate, Guntur, found the appellant and the employee concerned in each case guilty of the charges brought against them and sentenced the appellant (with whose case alone we are now concerned) to a fine of Rs. 30 on the first count an d Rs. 20 on the second in the first case with simple imprisonment for one week in default, and to a fine of Rs. 20 on each of the three counts in the second case with one week 's impris onment in default.
The plea of the appellant before the Magistrate was that he was the presiding 1st Class Bench Magistrate at Chirala, that he was carrying on business in petrol at various centres through servants and he had issued instructions to them not to deviate from the rules under any circumstances and that he could not be made liable for transgression of the rules committed by his employees.
The Magistrate however overruled the plea and convicted the appellant as stated above.
The appellant thereafter pre ferred an appeal to the Sessions Judge at Guntur, who, while setting aside the conviction of the appellant on the second count in each case, confirmed the conviction and sentence in respect of the other charges, on the 9th September, 1946.
This was confirmed in revision by the High Court at Madras on the 19th August, 1947.
Thereupon, the appellant applied to the Privy Council for special leave which was granted on the 9th July, 1948, limited to the single question whether mens rea is necessary to constitute an offence under rule 81 of the Defence of India Rules.
The question to be decided in this appeal arises upon the plea taken by the appellant.
, which has been already referred to, and the assumption on which the courts below have proceeded in dealing with the case.
The plea of the appellant that he was not present at 325 Guntur when the alleged offences were committed has not been negatived by the lower courts, but they have held that he was nevertheless liable, as the question of mens rea was not relevant to the offences with which the appellant was charged.
This view is set out very clearly in the following passage which may be quoted from the judgment of the trial Magistrate: ""It is argued on behalf of accused 1 that he is not a resident of Guntur and that he has no knowledge of any infringement committed by accused 2.
If any breach of the rules is committed by either proprietor or his servant, both are guilty whether they had the knowledge of the breach or not.
The question of mens rea will, of course, affect the measure of punishment but it cannot affect the conviction (vide .
"" Before deciding the question as to how far mens rea is material to conviction for the offences with which the appellant is charged, it is necessary to refer to the rele vant provisions of the Defence of India Rules and the Motor Spirit Rationing Order, 1941.
Rule 81(2) of the Defence of India Rules empowers the Central or the Provincial Govern ment to provide by order, in certain circumstances, for regulating amongst other matters, distribution, disposal, use or consumption of articles or things and for requiring articles or things kept for sale to be sold either generally or to specified persons or classes of persons or in speci fied circumstances.
The Central Government in pursuance of the authority thus conferred made the Motor Spirit Ration ing Order, 1941, for ""securing the defence of British India, the efficient prosecution of the war and for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the communi ty.
"" Clause 2(d) of the Order defines ""dealer"" as meaning a supplier carrying on the business of supplying motor spirit as a retail business and includes a person having charge of a supply of motor spirit controlled by Government from which any person is furnished with motor spirit for private use.
Sub clause (m) defines ""supplier"" as meaning a person carry ing on the business of supplying motor 326 spirit.
Clause 5, which is the next relevant provision, runs thus : ""Motor spirit required for any vehicle not covered by clause 3 or clause 4 shall be furnished or acquired only against the surrender to a supplier at the time of supply of valid ordinary coupons or of a valid supplementary coupon and only in accordance with any conditions or instructions appearing on or attached to the coupons.
"" Clause 22 lays down: ""No person shall furnish or acquire a supply of motor spirit otherwise than in accordance with the provisions contained in this order.
""Clause 27 is to the following effect:"" No person shall surrender to a supplier and no supplier shall accept special receipts or coupons at a time other than the time at which the supply of motor spirit authorised by the special receipts or coupons or acknowl edged by the receipts is furnished."" Clause 27A runs as follows : ""When motor spirit is furnished against the surrender of one or more coupons, the supplier shall immediately endorse, or cause to be endorsed, on each coupon so surren dered the registration or other identifying mark of the vehicle to which the motor spirit is furnished.
"" Rule 81(4)of the Defence of India Rules, which provides for the imposition of a penalty, says that ""if any person contravenes any order made under this rule, he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or both.
"" It is contended on behalf of the respondent that though ordinarily a person should not be held liable for the crimi nal acts of another and no person can be charged with the commission of an offence unless a particular.
intent or knowledge is found to be.
present, mens tea is not of the essence of the offences with which we are concerned in this case and the appellant must be held liable for the acts of his employees.
The question raised in this appeal was con sidered by the Privy 327 Council in Srinivas Mall Bairolia vs King Emperor(1).
In that case, the appellants before the Privy Council were convicted under the Defence of India Rules relating to the control of prices and were sentenced to terms of imprison ment.
The 1st appellant was acting as Salt Agent for part of the district of Darbhanga.
He had been appointed to this office by the District Magistrate, and it was his duty to sell to licensed retail dealers the supplies of salt which were allocated by the Central Government to his part of Dharbanga district.
The second appellant was employed by the first appellant and had been entrusted with the duty of allotting the appropriate quantity of salt to each retail dealer, and noting on the buyer 's licence the quantity which he had bought and received.
By rule 81 (2) of the Defence of India Rules, the Provincial Governments were empowered to make orders to provide for controlling the prices at which articles or things of any description whatsoever might be sold.
The Defence of India Act, 1939, under which the rules were framed, empowered the Provincial Governments to dele gate the exercise of their powers to certain officers, and the power to provide by order for controlling the prices at which various articles (among them salt) might be sold, had been delegated to the District Magistrates.
Rule 81 (4) of the Rules provided for the punishment of persons guilty of contravening any such orders.
Both the appellants were jointly charged with having sold salt on 3 days in July, 1943, to three named traders, in each case at a price ex ceeding the maximum price which had been fixed by order of the District Magistrate.
The 1st appellant was also sepa rately charged, in respect of the same sales, with having abetted the 2nd appellant 's contravention of the order.
The trial Magistrate acquitted the 1st appellant of the substan tive offences but convicted him on the 3 charges of abet ting.
The Sessions Judge and the High Court in revision confirmed the convictions.
The Privy Council ultimately upheld the conviction of the appellants on the merits but with regard to the view taken by the High Court that even if the first appellant was (1) I.L.R. 26 Pat.
46. 328 not proved to have known of the unlawful acts of the second appellant, he was still liable on the ground that ' 'where there is an absolute prohibition and no question of mens rea arises, the master is criminally liable for the acts of the servant"", their Lordships observed as follows: ""With due respect to the High Court, their Lordships think it necessary to express their dissent from this view.
They see no ground for saying that offences against those of the Defence of India Rules here in question are within the limited and exceptional class of offences which can be held to be committed without a guilty mind.
See the judgment of Wright J. in Sherras vs De Rutzen(1).
Offences which are within that class are usually of a comparatively minor character, and it would be a surprising result of this delegated legislation if a person who was morally inno cent of blame could be held vicariously liable for a serv ant 's crime and so punishable ' with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years. ' Their Lordships agree with the view which was recently expressed by the Lord Chief Justice of England, when he said: ' It is in my opinion of the utmost importance for the protection of the liberty of the subject that a court should always bear in mind that, unless the statute, either clearly or by necessary implica tion rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, a defendant should not be found guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he has got a guilty mind: Brend vs Wood(2) '"" In our opinion, the view of the law as propounded by the Privy Council is the correct view, and, applying it to the present case, it is difficult to hold the appellant guilty of the offence under clause 22 read with clause 5 of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order, 1941.
The language of clause 22 does not lend support to the contention that even an innocent master will be criminally liable for an act of his servant.
This clause has already been quoted, but, to make the point clear, it may be stated that it provides that no person shall furnish . motor spirit otherwise than in accordance (1) , 921.
(2) (1946) 110 J.P. 317, 318 329 with the provisions contained in the Order.
The clause is not aimed specifically against a supplier, but is general in its language, and will hit the individual person, whether he be the supplier or not, who contravenes the provision.
The language of the clause also suggests that only the person who furnishes motor spirit contrary to the provisions of the Order will be affected by the contravention.
In the course of the arguments, reference was made on behalf of the appellant to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Isak Solomon Macmull vs Emperor(1) which is a case relating to the contravention of clause 22 of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order.
In that case, the learned Chief Justice, who delivered the judgment, referred to the well established rule that unless a statute either clearly or by necessary implication rules out mens rea as a constituent part of a crime, the defendant should not be held guilty of an offence under the criminal law unless he has a guilty mind.
Relying upon this rule, he held that where a servant sells petrol to a bogus customer in the absence of coupons m contravention of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order, and the master is not present at the time nor has he any knowledge of the supply of petrol by the servants to the bogus custom er, the master cannot be held to be vicariously liable for the act of the servant.
In our opinion, this decision is correct and is directly applicable to the present case.
We have yet to deal with the third charge in the second case, which relates to the infringement of clause 27A of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order.
That clause, as already stat ed, makes it incumbent upon the supplier to endorse, or cause to be endorsed, the registration or other identifying mark of the vehicle to which the motor spirit is furnished.
The substance of the charge on which the appellant has been convicted is that these particulars were not endorsed on several coupons against which petrol had been supplied.
Here again, the main contention put forward on behalf of the (1) A.I.R. 1948 Bom.
43 330 appellant was that the appellant cannot be held guilty inasmuch as the default in question was committed not by him personally, but by his servants.
Having regard to the language of the clause, however, this contention cannot be accepted.
Clause 27A, as we have already seen, throws the responsibility for making the necessary endorsement on the supplier.
The definition of the word 'supplier ' in the Act has already been quoted, and there can be no doubt that if clause 27A is contravened, a person who comes within the definition of the word 'supplier ' must be held guilty of the contravention.
The object of this clause clearly is that the supplier of petrol should set up a complete machinery to ensure that the necessary endorsements are made on the coupons against which petrol is supplied.
It is conceivable that in many cases the default will be committed by the servants of the supplier, who are in charge of the petrol pump, but that fact by itself will not exonerate the suppli er from liability.
In Mousell Brothers vs London and North Western Railway( '), Viscount Reading C.J., dealing with a case under the Railways Clauses Consolidation Act, 1845, observed as follows : ""Prima facie, then, a master is not to be made criminal ly responsible for the acts of his servant to which the master is not a party.
But it may be the intention of the Legislature, in order to guard against the happening of the forbidden thing, to impose a liability upon a principal even though he does not know of, and is not party to, the forbid den act done by his servant.
Many statutes are passed with this object.
Acts done by the servant of the licensed holder of licensed premises render the licensed holder in some instances liable, even though the act was done by his serv ant without the knowledge of the master.
Under the Food and Drugs Acts there are again instances well known in these Courts where the master is made responsible, even though he knows nothing of the act done by his servant, and he may be fined or rendered amenable to the penalty enjoined by the law.
In those [1) [1917] 2 K.B.D. 836 at 844.
331 cases the Legislature absolutely forbids the act and makes the principal liable without a mens rea.
"" In the same case, Atkin J. expressed the same view in these words : ""I think that the authorities cited by my Lord make it plain that while prima facie a principal is not to be made criminally responsible for the acts of his servants, yet the Legislature may prohibit an act or enforce a duty in such words as to make the prohibition or the duty absolute; in which case the principal is liable if the act is in fact done by his servants.
To ascertain whether a particular Act of Parliament has that effect or not regard must be had to the object of the statute, the words used, the nature of the duty laid down, the person upon whom it is imposed, the person by whom it would in ordinary circumstances be per formed, and the person upon whom the penalty is imposed.
If authority for this is necessary it will be found in the judgment of Bowen L.J. in Reg.
vs Tylor(1). ' ' In Mullins vs Collins(2), the servant of a licensed victualler having knowingly supplied liquor to a constable on duty without the authority of his superior officer, it was held that the licensed victualler was liable to be convicted although he had no knowledge of the act of his servant.
In dealing with the case, Blackburn J. observed thus: ""If we hold that there must be a personal knowledge in the licensed person, we should make the enactment of no effect.
"" There are many other cases in England in which the same view has been enunciated, and some of them have been col lected and classified in the judgment of Wright J. in Sher ras vs De Rutzen(3), The principle laid down in these cases has been followed in several cases in this country also.
In this view, the appeal is allowed in part, and while the conviction and sentence imposed on the (1) (3)[1895] IQB.
918,922.
(2) [1874] L.,R. 9 Q. B. 292 332 appellant on the first charge in both the cases are quashed, the conviction and sentence on the third charge in the second case are affirmed.
Appeal allowed in part.
","Unless a statute either clearly or by necessary implica tion rules out mens rea as a constituent part of the crime, a person should not be found guilty of an offence against the criminal law unless he has got a guilty mind.
Clauses 22 and 25 of the Motor Spirit Rationing Order, 1941, read with the Defence of India Rules, 1939, do not rule out the necessity of mens rea.
Therefore, where the employees of the licensee of a petrol filling station supply petrol to a car owner without taking coupons and thus act in contravention of the provisions of the said clauses, the licensee, who was not present when the wrongful act was done and had no knowledge of it, could not be convicted for contravention of the said clauses under r. 81 (4) of the Defence of India Rules, 1939.
Clause 27 of the said Order is however differently worded and imposes a duty on the supplier to endorse or cause to be endorsed the registration or other identifying mark of the vehicle to which petrol is furnished and if these particulars are not endorsed by his employees on the petrol coupons against which petrol is supplied the supplier would be liable even if he had no knowledge of the wrongful act of his employees.

N.P. Asthana, and N.C. Chatterjee (K.B. Asthana, with them) for the appellant.
P.L. Banerjee (Sri Ram, with him) for the respondent.
March 19.
The judgment of the Court was deliv ered by KANIA C.J.
This is an appeal by special leave against an order of the Allahabad High Court dismissing the revision petition of the appellant against the order of the Special Magistrate refusing to quash the proceedings on the ground that the prosecution of the appellant inter alia under sections 161 and 165 of 314 the Indian Penal Code was illegal and without jurisdiction in the absence of the sanction of the Government under section 107 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section 6 of the Prevention of Corruption.
Act (II of 1947), hereafter referred to as the Act.
The material facts are these.
In 1947 the appellant held the office of Regional Deputy Iron and Steel Controller, Kanpur Circle, U.P., and was a public servant.
The police having suspected the appellant to be guilty of the offences mentioned above applied to the Deputy Magistrate, Kanpur, for a warrant of his arrest on the 22nd of October, 1947, and the warrant was issued on the next day.
The appellant was arrested on the 27th of October, 1947, but was granted bail.
On the 26th of November, 1947, the District Magistrate cancelled his bail as the Magistrate considered that the sureties were not proper.
On the 1st of December, 1947, the Government appointed a Special Magis trate to try offences under the Act and on the 1st December, 1947, the appellant was produced before the Special Magis trate and was granted bail.
The police continued their investigation.
On the 6th of December, 1948, sanction was granted by the Provincial Government to prosecute the appel lant inter alia under sections 161 and 165 of of the Indian Penal Code.
On the 31st January, 1949, sanction in the same terms was granted by the Central Government.
In the meantime as a result of an appeal made by the appellant to the High Court of Allahabad the amount of his bail was reduced and on the 25th of March, 1949, the appellant was ordered to be put up before the Magistrate to answer the charge sheet submit ted by the prosecution.
On behalf of the appellant it is argued that when the warrant for his arrest was issued by the Magistrate on the 22nd of October, 1947, the Magistrate took cognizance of the offence and, as no sanction of the Government had been obtained before that day, the initiation of the proceedings against him, which began on that day without the sanction of the Government, was illegal.
It is argued that the same proceedings are continuing against him and therefore the notice to 315 appear before the Magistrate issued on 25th March, 1949, is also illegal.
In support of his contention that the Magis trate took cognizance of the offences on 22nd March, 1947, he relies principally on certain observations in Emperor vs Sourindra Mohan Chuckerbutty(1).
It is therefore necessary to determine when the Magis trate took cognizance of the offence.
The relevant part of section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code runs as follows: 190.
(1)""Except as hereinafter provided, any Presidency Magistrate, District Magistrate or Sub divisional Magistrate and any other Magistrate specially empowered in this behalf, may take cognizance of any offence (a) upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence; (b) upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer; (c) upon information received from any person other than a police officer, or upon his own knowledge or suspicion, that such offence has been committed. "" It is clear from the wording of the section that the initiation of the proceedings against a person commences on the cognizance of the offence by the Magistrate under one of the three contingencies mentioned in the section.
The first contingency evidently is in respect of non cognizable of fences as defined in the Criminal Procedure Code on the complaint of an aggrieved person.
The second is on a police report, which evidently is the case of a cognizable offence when the police have completed their investigation and come to the Magistrate for the issue of a process.
The third is when the Magistrate himself takes notice of an offence and issues the process.
It is important to remember that in respect of any cognizable offence, the police, at the initial stage when they are investigating the matter, can arrest a person without obtaining an (1) I.L.R. 41 316 order from the Magistrate.
Under section 167(b) of the Criminal Procedure Code the police have of course to put up the person so arrested before a Magistrate within 24 hours and obtain an order of remand to police custody for the purpose of further investigation, if they so desire.
But they have the power to arrest a person for the purpose of investigation without approaching the Magistrate first.
Therefore in cases of cognizable offence before proceedings are initiated and while the matter is under investigation by the police the suspected person is liable to be arrested by the police without an order by the Magistrate.
It may also be noticed that the Magistrate who makes the order of remand may be one who has no jurisdiction to try the case.
The offences for which the appellant is charged are under the Criminal Procedure Code non cognizable and there fore if the matter fell to be determined only on the provi sions of the Criminal Procedure Code the appellant could not be arrested without an order of the Magistrate.
The posi tion however is materially altered because of section 3 of the Act which runs as follows: 3.
""An offence punishable under section 161 or section 165 of the Indian Penal Code shall be deemed to be a cogniz able offence for the purposes of the Code of Criminal Proce dure, 1898, notwithstanding anything to the contrary con tained therein.
Provided that a police officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police shall not investigate any such offence without the order of a Magistrate of the first class or make any arrest therefor without a warrant.
"" It therefore follows that for the Prevention of Corrup tion Act, offences under sections 161 and 165 of the Indian Penal Code become cognizable, notwithstanding what is pro vided in the Criminal Procedure Code.
The proviso to sec tion 3 of the Act puts only two limitations on the powers of the police in connection with the investigation relating to those offences under the Act.
They are: (1) that the inves tigation 317 should be conducted by an officer not below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police unless a Magistrate of the first class otherwise orders; and (2) if an arrest has to be made an order of the Magistrate has to be obtained.
The important point to be borne in mind is that the order of the Magistrate, which has to be obtained, is during the time the police is investigating the case and not when they have completed their investigation and are initiating the pro ceedings against the suspected person under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The order which may be applied for and made during the police investigation by virtue of section 3 of the Act is therefore before the Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offence under section 6 of the Act or section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
That appears to us to be the result of reading sections 3 and 6 of Act II of 1947 and section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code read with the definition of cognizable offence in the Code.
The argument of the appellant is that when the Magis trate issued the warrant in October, 1947, he did so on taking cognizance of the offence under section 161 or 165 of the Indian Penal Code under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
It was contended that without such cogni zance the Magistrate had no jurisdiction to issue any proc ess as that was the only section which permitted the Magis trate to issue a process against a person suspected of having committed an offence.
In our opinion having regard to the wording of section 3 of the Act the assumption that the Magistrate can issue a warrant only after taking cogni zance of an offence under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code is unsound.
The proviso to section 3 of the Act expressly covers the case of a Magistrate issuing a warrant for the arrest of a person in the course of investi gation only and on the footing that it is a cognizable offence.
Section 3 of the Act which makes an offence under section 161 or 165 of the Indian Penal Code cognizable has provided the two safeguards as the proceedings are contem plated against a public servant.
But because of these safe guards it 318 does not follow that the warrant issued by the Magistrate under section 3 of the Act is after cognizance of the of fence, and not during the course of investigation by the police in respect of a cognizable offence.
The only effect of that proviso is that instead of the police officer ar resting on his own motion he has got to obtain an order of the Magistrate for the arrest.
In our opinion, it is wrong from this feature of section 3 of the Act alone to contend that because the warrant is issued it must be after the Magistrate has taken cognizance of it and the Magistrate 's action can be only under section 190 of the Criminal Proce dure Code.
The material part of section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that where any public servant who is not removable from his office save with the sanction of Government is accused of an offence alleged to have been committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty, no court shall take cogni zance of such offence except with the previous sanction of the appropriate Government.
This section read as following section 190 shows that the word 'cognizance ' in this section indicates the stage of initiation of proceedings against a public servant.
Sections 190 to 199 B of the Criminal Proce dure Code are grouped together under the caption ""Initiation of proceedings"".
The sections dealing with the stage of in vestigation by the police in the case of cognizable offences are quite different.
Under section 6 of the Act it is pro vided that no court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under section 161 or 165 of the Indian Penal Code . alleged to have been committed by a public servant except with the previous sanction of the appropriate Government.
Reading sections 197 and 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code and section 6 of the Act in the light of the wording of the proviso to section a, it is therefore clear that the stage at which a warrant is asked for under the proviso to section 3 of the Act is not on cognizance of the offence by the Magistrate as contemplated by the other three sections.
319 Learned counsel for the appellant relied on some observa tions in Emperor vs Sourindra Mohan Chuckerbutty (1), in respect of the interpretation of the word 'cognizance '.
In that case, on the 24th April, 1909, a dacoity took place at N and on the same day the police sent up a report of the occurrence to the Sub divisional officer of Diamond Harbour.
On the 2nd September one of the accused was arrested and he made a confession on the 18th October.
The case was subse quently transferred by the District Magistrate of Alipore to his own file and on the 20th January, 1910, an order under section 2 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act (XIV of 1908) was issued in the following terms: ""Whereas the District Magistrate of the 24 Parganas has taken cognizance of offences under sections 395 and 397, I.P.C., alleged to have been committed by the persons accused in the case of Emperor vs Lalit Mohan Chuckerbutty and others . and whereas it appears to the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal. the provi sions of Part 1 of the Indian Criminal Law Amendment Act should be made to apply to the proceedings in respect of the said offences, now, therefore, the Lieutenant Governor. directs. that the provisions of the said Part shall apply to the said case.
"" S surrendered on the 24th of January and was arrested by the police and put before the Joint Magis trate of Alipore who remanded him to Jail.
Applications for bail on his behalf were made but they were dismissed.
The Sessions Judge was next moved unsuccessfully for bail under section 498 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
S then moved the High Court for a Rule calling upon the District Magistrate to show cause why bail should not be granted on the grounds (1) that no order had been made applying Act XIV of 1908 and (2) that there did not appear any sufficient cause for further inquiry into the guilt of section The first contention rested on the assertion that the Magistrate had not taken cognizance of the offence of dacoity on the 20th of January.
The learned Judges pointed out that the argument was ad vanced because the legal adviser of S had (1) 1. 320 SUPREME COURT REPORTS no opportunity to see the record of the case.
On the facts it was clear that the Magistrate had taken cognizance of the offence on the 20th of January.
The observations ""taking cognizance does not involve any formal action or indeed action of any kind but occurs as soon as a. magistrate as such applies his mind to the suspected commission of an offence"" have to be read in the light of these facts.
As noticed above, the magistrate had expressly recorded that he had taken cognizance of the case and thereupon the provi sions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act were made applicable to the case.
The question argued before the High Court was in respect of the power of the High Court to grant bail after the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act were applied to the case.
In our opinion therefore that decision and the observations therein do not help the appellant.
In Gopal Marwari vs Emperor (1), it was observed that the word 'cognizance 'is used in the Code to indicate the point when the Magistrate or a Judge first takes judicial notice of an offence.
it is a different thing from the initiation of proceedings.
It is the condition precedent to the initiation of proceedings by the Magistrate.
The court noticed that the word 'cognizance 'is a word of somewhat indefinite import and it is perhaps not always used in exactly the same sense.
After referring to the observations in Emperor vs Sou rindra Mohan Chuckerbutty (2), it was stated by Das Gupta J. in Superintendent and Remembrancer of Legal Affairs, West Bengal vs Abani Kumar Banerjee (3) as follows : "" What is taking cognizance has not been defined in the Criminal Procedure Code and I have no desire to attempt to define it.
It seems to me clear however that before it can be said that any magistrate has taken cognizance of any offence under section 190 (1) (a), Criminal Procedure Code, he must not only have applied his mind to the contents of the petition but he must have done so for the purpose (1) A.I.R. 1943 Pat.
(3) A.I.R. 1950 Cal.
(2) I. L. R. 321 of proceeding in a particular way as indicated in the subse quent provisions of this Chapter proceeding under section 200 and thereafter sending it for inquiry and report under section 202.
When the magistrate applies his mind not for the purpose of proceeding under the subsequent sections of this Chapter, but for taking action of some other kind, e.g., ordering investigation under section 156 (3), or issuing a search warrant for the purpose of the investiga tion, he cannot be said to have taken cognizance of the offence.
"" In our opinion that is the correct approach to the question before the court.
Moreover, in the present case on the 25th March, 1949, the Magistrate issued a notice under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code against the appellant and made it returnable on the 2nd of May, 1949.
That clearly shows that the Magistrate took cognizance of the offence only on that day and acted under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
On the returnable date the appellant contended that the sanction of the Central Government was void because it was not given by the Government of the State.
On the deci sion going against him he appealed to the High Court and to the Privy Council.
The appellant 's contention having thus failed, the Magistrate proceeded with the trial on the 26th of November, 1949.
The only question which is now presented for our decision therefore is whether there was any sanction granted by the Government before the Magistrate took cogni zance of the offence and issued the notice under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code On the 25th March, 1949.
To that the clear answer is that the Government had given its sanction for the prosecution of the appellant before that date.
It seems to us therefore that the appellant 's conten tion that the Magistrate had to take cognizance of the offences without the previous sanction of the Government is untenable and the appeal fails.
Appeal dismissed.
","Under section 3 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
1947, an offence punishable under section 161 or section 165 of the Indian Penal Code 313 is a cognisable offence for the purposes of the Criminal Procedure Code subject to the condition that the police shall not investigate without an order of a magistrate of the first class or make an arrest without a warrant; and when the police apply for a warrant of arrest during inves tigation under section 3 of the said Act and the magistrate issues a warrant, he is not deemed to have taken cognisance of the case under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code and the fact that sanction of the Government under section 197 of the Criminal Procedure Code had not been obtained before the warrant was issued would not vitiate the trial.
Having regard to the wording of section 3 of the said Act the view that the magistrate can issue a warrant only after taking congni sance of the offence under section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code, is unsound.
Before it can be said that a magistrate has taken cogni sance of an offence under section 190 (1) (a) of the Criminal Procedure Code, he must not only have applied his mind to the contents of the petition but have done so for the pur pose of proceeding under section 200 and the subsequent provi sions of the Code.
Where he applied his mind only for ordering investigation or issuing a warrant for purposes of investigation he cannot be said to have taken cognisance of the offence.

May 26.
The Judgment of Kania C.J., Mehr Chand Mahajan, Mukherjea and Das JJ.
was delivered by Patanjali Sastri J. Fazl Ali J. delivered a separate judgment.
PATANJALI SASTRI J.
The petitioner is the printer, publisher and editor of a recently started weekly journal in English called Cross Roads printed and published in Bombay.
The Government of Madras, the respondents herein, in exer cise of their powers under section 9 (1 A) of the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act, 1949 (hereinafter referred to as the impugned Act) purported to issue an order No. MS.
1333 dated 1st March, 1950, whereby they imposed a ban upon the entry and circulation of the journal in that State.
The order was published in the Fort St. George Gazette and the notification ran as follows : ""In exercise of the powers conferred by section 9 (I A) of the Madras Maintenance of Public Order, Act, 1949 (Madras Act XXIII of 1949) His Excellency the Governor of Madras, being satisfied that for the purpose of securing the public safety and the maintenance of public order, it is necessary so to do, hereby prohibits, with effect on and from the date of publication of this order in the Fort St. George Gazette the entry into or the circulation, sale or distribution in the State of Madras or any part thereof of the newspaper entitled Cross Roads an English weekly published at Bombay.
"" The petitioner claims that the said order contravenes the fundamental right of the petitioner to freedom of See the headnote to Brij Bhushan vs The State of Delhi, p. 605 infra.
596 speech and expression conferred on him by article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution and he challenges the validity of section 9 (1 A) of the impugned Act as being void under article 13 (1) of the Constitution by reason of its being inconsistent with his fundamental right aforesaid.
The Advocate General of Madras appearing on be half of the respondents raised a preliminary objection, not indeed to the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain the application under article 32, but to the petitioner resort ing to this Court directly for such relief in the first instance.
He contended that, as a matter of orderly proce dure, the petitioner should first resort to the High Court at Madras which under article 226 of the Constitution has concurrent jurisdiction to deal with the matter.
He cited criminal revision petitions under section 435 of the Crimi nal Procedure Code, applications for bail and applications for transfer under section 24 of the Civil Procedure Code as instances where, concurrent jurisdiction having been given in certain matters to the High Court and the Court of a lower grade, a rule of practice has been established that a party should proceed first to the latter Court for relief before resorting to the High Court.
He referred to Emperor vs Bisheswar Prasad Sinha (1) where such a rule of practice was enforced in a criminal revision case, and called our attention also to certain American decisions Urquhart vs Brown (2) and Hooney vs Kolohan (3) as showing that the Supreme Court of the United States ordinarily required that whatever judicial remedies remained open to the appli cant in Federal and State Courts should be exhausted before the remedy in the Supreme Court be it habeas corpus or certiorari would be allowed.
We are of opinion that neither the instances mentioned by the learned Advocate General nor the American decisions referred to by him are really analogous to the remedy afforded by article 32 of the Indian Constitution.
That article does not merely confer power on this Court, as article 226 does on the (1) I.L.R. 56 All.
(2) ; (3) ; 597 High Courts, to issue certain writs for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III or for any other purpose, as part of its general jurisdiction.
In that case it would have been more appropriately placed among articles 131 to 139 which define that jurisdiction.
Article 32 provides a ""guaranteed"" remedy for the enforcement of those rights, and this remedial right is itself made a fundamental right by being included in Part 1II.
This Court is thus constituted the protector and guarantor of fundamental rights, and it cannot, consistently with the responsibility so laid upon it, refuse to entertain applications seeking protection against infringements of such rights.
No similar provision is to be found in the Constitution of the United States and we do not consider that the American decisions are in point.
Turning now to the merits, there can be no doubt that freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of propa gation of ideas, and that freedom is ensured by the freedom of circulation.
""Liberty of circulation is as essential to that freedom as the liberty of publication.
Indeed, without circulation the publication would be of little value "": Ex parte Jackson(1).
See also LoveIl vs City of Griffin(s).
It is therefore perfectly clear that the order of the Gov ernment of Madras would be a violation of the petitioner 's fundamental right under article 19 (1) (a), unless section 9 (1 A) of the impugned Act under which it was made is saved by the reservations mentioned in clause (2) of article 19 which (omitting immaterial words regarding laws relating to libel, slander, etc., with which we are not concerned in this case) saves the operation of any ""existinglaw in so far as it relates to any matter which undermines the security of, or tends to overthrow, the State.
"" The question accord ingly arises whether, the impugned Act, in so far as it purports by section 9 (1 A) to authorise the Provincial Government ""for the purpose of securing the public safety or the maintenance of public order, to prohibit or regulate the entry into (1) ; (2) ; 598 or the circulation, sale or distribution in the Province of Madras or any part thereof of any document or class of documents"" is a ""law relating to any matter which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the State."" The impugned Act was passed by the Provincial Legisla ture in exercise of the power conferred upon it by section 100 of the Government of India Act 1935, read with Entry 1 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to that Act, which com prises among other matters, ""public order.
"" Now ""public order"" is an expression of wide connotation and signifies that state of tranquillity which prevails among the members of a political society as a result of the internal regula tions enforced by the government which they have estab lished.
Although section 9 (I A) refers to ""securing the public safety"" and ""the maintenance of public order"" as distinct purposes, it must be taken that ""public safety"" is used as a part of the wider concept of public order, for, if public safety were intended to signify any 'matter distinct from and outside the content of the expression ""public order,"" it would not have been competent for the Madras Legislature to enact the provision so far as it relates to public safety.
This indeed was not disputed on behalf of the respondents.
But it was urged that the expression ""public safety"" in the impugned Act, which is a statute relating to law and order, means the security of the Province, and, therefore, ' 'the security of the State"" with the meaning of article 19 (2)as ""the State"" has been defined in article 12 as including, among other things, the Government and the Legislature of each of the erstwhile Provinces.
Much reli ance was placed in support of this view on Rex vs Wormwood Scrubbs Prison(1) where it was held that the phrase ""for securing the public safety and the ' defence of.
the realm"" in section 1 of the Defence of the Realm (Consolidation) Act, 1914, was not limited to securing the country against a foreign foe but included also protection against internal disorder such as a rebellion.
The decision is not of much assistance to the respondents as the context in (1) 599 which the words ""public safety"" occurred in that Act showed unmistakably that the security of the State was the aim in view.
Our attention has not been drawn to any definition of the expression ""public safety,"" nor does it appear that the words have acquired any technical signification as words of article ""Public safety"" ordinarily means security of the public or their freedom from danger.
In that sense, anything which tends to prevent dangers to public health may also be regarded as securing public safety.
The meaning of the expression must, however, vary according to the context.
In the classification of offenCes in the Indian Penal Code, for instance, Chapter XIV enumerates the ""offences affecting the public health, safety, convenience, decency, and morals"" and it includes rash driving or riding on a public way (section 279) and rash navigation of a vessel (section 280), among others, as offences against public safety, while Chapter VI lists waging war against the Queen (section 121), sedition (section 124 A) etc.
as ""offences against the State"", because they are calculated to undermine or affect the security of the State, and Chapter VIII defines ""of fences against the public tranquillity"" which include unlaw ful assembly (section 141) rioting (section 146), promot ing enmity between classes (section 153 A), affray (sec tion 159) etc.
Although in the context of a statute relat ing to law and order ""securing public safety"" may not in clude the securing of public health, it may well mean secur ing the public against rash driving on a public way and the like, and not necessarily the security of the State.
It was said that an enactment which provided for drastic remedies like preventive detention and ban on newspapers must be taken to relate to matters affecting the security of the State rather than trivial offences like rash driving, or an affray.
But whatever ends the impugned Act may have been intended to subserve, and whatever aims its framers may have had in view, its application and scope cannot, in the ab sence of limiting words in the statute itself, be restricted to those aggravated forms of prejudicial activity which are calculated to 600 endanger the security of the State.
Nor is there any guar antee that those authorised to exercise the powers under the Act will in using them discriminate between those who act prejudicially to the security of the State and those who do not.
The Government of India Act, 1935, nowhere used the expression"" security of the State"" though it made provision under section 57 for dealing with crimes of violence intend ed to overthrow the Government.
While the administration of law and order including the maintenance of public order was placed in charge of a Minister elected by the people, the Governor was entrusted with the responsibility of combating the operations of persons who ""endangered the peace or tranquillity of the Province"" by committing or attempting to commit ""crimes of violence intended to overthrow the Govern ment.
"" Similarly, article 352 of the Constitution empowers the President to make a Proclamation of Emergency when he is satisfied that the ""security of India or any part of the territory thereof is threatened by war or by external ag gression or by internal disturbance.
"" These provisions recognise that disturbance of public peace or tranquillity may assume such grave proportions as to threaten the securi ty of the State.
As Stephen in his 'Criminal Law of England(1) observes: ' ' Unlawful assemblies, riots, insurrections, rebellions, levying of war, are offences which run into each other and are not capable of being marked off by perfectly defined boundaries.
All of them have in common one feature, namely, that the normal tranquillity of a civilised society is in each of the cases mentioned disturbed either by actual force or at least by the show and threat of it.
"" Though all these offences thus involve disturbances of public tranquil lity and are in theory offences against public order, the difference between them being only a difference ' of degree, yet for the purpose of grading the punishment to be inflict ed in respect of them they may be classified into different minor categories as has been done by (1) Vol.
II, p. 242.
601 the Indian Penal Code.
Similarly, the Constitution, in formulating the varying criteria for permissible legislation imposing restrictions on the fundamental rights enumerated in article 19 (1), has placed in a distinct category those offences against public order which aim at undermining the security of the State or overthrowing it, and made their prevention the sole justification for legislative abridge ment of freedom of speech and expression, that is to say, nothing less than endangering the foundations of the State or threatening its overthrow could justify curtailment of the rights to freedom of speech and expression, while the right of peaceable assembly ""sub clause (b)"" and the right of association ""sub clause (c)"" may be restricted under clauses (3) and (4) of article 19 in the interests of"" public order,"" which in those clauses includes the security of the State.
The differentiation is also noticeable in Entry 3 of List III (Concurrent List) of the Seventh Sched ule, which refers to the ""security of a State"" and ""mainte nance of public order"" as distinct subjects of.legislation.
The Constitution thus requires a line to be drawn in the field of public order or tranquillity marking off, may be, roughly, the boundary between those serious and aggravated forms of public disorder which are calculated to endanger the security of the State and the relatively minor breaches of the peace of a purely local significance, treating for this purpose differences in degree as if they were differ ences in kind.
It is also worthy of note that the word ""sedition"" which occurred in article 13 (2) of the Draft Constitution pre pared by the Drafting Committee was deleted before the article was finally.
passed as article 19 (2).
In this connection it may be recalled that the Federal Court had, in defining sedition in Niharendu Dutt Majumdar vs The King Emperor (1), held that ""the acts or words complained of must either incite to disorder or must be such as to satisfy reasonable men that that is their intention or tendency"", but the Privy Council overruled that 602 decision and emphatically reaffirmed the view expressed in Tilak 's case (1) to the effect that ""the offence ""consisted in exciting or attempting to excite in others certain bad feelings towards the Government and not in exciting or attempting to excite mutiny or rebellion, or any sort of actual disturbance, great or small "" King Emperor vs Sada shiv Narayan Bhalerao (2) Deletion of the word ""sedition"" from the draft article 13 (2), therefore, shows that criticism of Government exciting disaffection or bad feel ings towards it is not to be regarded as a justifying ground for restricting the freedom of expression and of the press, unless it is such as to undermine the security of or tend to overthrow the State.
It is also significant that the corre sponding Irish formula of ""undermining the public order or the authority of the State"" article 40 (6) (i) of the Constitution of Eire, [1937] did not apparently find favour with the framers of the Indian Constitution.
Thus, very narrow and stringent limits have been set to permissible legislative abridgement of the right of free speech and expression, and this was doubtless due to the realisation that freedom of speech and of the press lay at the founda tion of all democratic organisations, for without free political discussion no public education, so essential for the proper functioning of the processes of popular govern ment, is possible.
A freedom of such amplitude might involve risks of abuse.
But the framers of the Constitution may well have reflected, with Madison who was ""the leading spirit in the preparation of the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution,"" that ""it is better to leave a few of its noxious branches to their luxuriant growth, than, by pruning them away, to injure the vigour of those yielding the proper fruits."": [Quoted in Near vs Minnesotta (3)].
We are therefore of opinion 'that unless a law restrict ing freedom of speech and expression is directed solely against the undermining of the security of the State or the overthrow of it, such law cannot fall within the reservation under clause (2) of article 19, although the (1) (21 L.R. 74, I A. 89.
(8) 282U.S, 607, 717 8.
603 restrictions which it seeks to impose may have been con ceived generally in the interests of public order.
It fol lows that section 9 (1 A) which authorises imposition of restrictions for the wider purpose of securing public safety or the maintenance of public order falls outside the scope of authorised restrictions under clause (2), and is there fore void and unconstitutional.
It was, however, argued that section 9 (1 A) could not be considered wholly void, as, under article 13 (1), an existing law inconsistent with a fundamental right is void only to the extent of the inconsistency and no more.
In so far as the securing of the public safety or the maintenance of public order would include the ' security of the State, the impugned provision, as applied to the latter purpose, was covered by clause (2) of article 19 and must, it was said, be held to be valid.
We are unable to accede to this contention.
Where a law purports to authorise the imposi tion of restrictions on a fundamental right in language wide enough to cover restrictions both within and without the limits of constitutionally permissible legislative action affecting such right, it is not possible to uphold it even so far as it may be applied within the constitutional lim its, as it is not severable.
So long as the possibility of its being applied for purposes not sanctioned by the Consti tution cannot be ruled out, it must be held to be wholly unconstitutional and void.
In other words, clause (2) of article 19 having allowed the imposition of restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression only in cases where danger to the State is involved, an enactment, which is capable of being applied to cases where no such danger could arise, cannot be held to be constitutional and valid to any extent.
The application is therefore allowed and the order of the respondents prohibiting the entry and circulation of the petitioner 's journal in the State of Madras is hereby quashed.
FAZL ALI J.
For the reasons given by me in Brij Bhushan and Another vs The State(1) , which practically 605.
604 involves the same question as is involved in this case, I hold that the reliefs sought by the petitioner cannot be granted.
In this view, I would dismiss this petition, but I should like to add a few observations to supplement what I have said in the other case.
It appears to me that in the ultimate analysis the real question to be decided in this case is whether ""disorders involving menace to the peace and tranquillity of the Prov ince"" and affecting ""public safety"" will be a matter which undermines the security of the State or not.
I have bor rowed the words quoted within inverted commas from the preamble of the Act which shows its scope and necessity and the question raised before us attacking the, validity of the Act must be formulated in the manner I have suggested.
If the answer to the question is in the affirmative, as I think it must be, then the impugned law which prohibits entry into the State of Madras of ""any document or class of documents"" for securing public safety and maintenance of public order should satisfy the requirements laid down in article 19 (2)of the Constitution.
From the trend of the arguments addressed to us, it would appear that if a docu ment is seditious, its entry could be validly prohibited, because sedition is a matter which undermines the security of the State; but if, on the other hand, the document is calculated to disturb public tranquillity and affect public safety, its entry cannot be prohibited, because public disorder and disturbance of public tranquillity are not matters which undermine the security of the State.
Speaking for myself, I cannot understand this argument.
In Brij Bhushan and Another vs The State(1), I have quoted good authority to show that sedition owes its gravity to its tendency to create disorders and an authority on criminal law like Sir James Stephen has classed sedition as an of fence against public tranquillity.
If so, how could sedi tion be a matter which would undermine the security of the State and public disorders and disturbance of public safety will not be such a matter? It was argued that a small riot or an affray will not (1) ; 605 undermine the security of the State, but to this line of argument there is a two fold answer : (1) The Act, as its preamble shows, is not intended for petty disorders but for disorders involving menace to the peace and tranquillity of the Province, (2) There are de grees of gravity in the offence of sedition also and an isolated piece of writing of mildly seditious character by one insignificant individual may not also, from the layman 's point of view, be a matter which undermines the security of the State, but that would not affect the law which aims at checking sedition.
It was also said that the law as it stands may be misused by the State executive, but misuse of the law is one thing and its being unconstitutional is another.
We are here concerned with the latter aspect only.
I shall not pursue the matter further as I have said enough on the subject in the connected case.

Appeal against a Judgment and.
Order dated 22nd January, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature at Patna (Imam J.) in Criminal Revision No. 1533 of 1950 677 S.P. Sinha (P.S. Safeer and K.N. Aggarwal, with him) for the appellants.
The respondent did not appear.
May 24.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.
This is an appeal by special leave from an order of the High Court of Judicature at Patna setting aside an order of acquittal of the appellants by the Sessions Judge, Purnea, and directing their retrial.
The appellants were prosecuted for alleged offences under sections 147, 148, 323, 324, 326, 302 and 302/149 of the Indian Penal Code at the instance of one Polai Lal Biswas who lodged a complaint against them before the po lice.
The prosecution case was that, while the complainant was harvesting the paddy crop on his field at about 10 a.m. on 29th November, 1949, a mob of about fifty persons came on to the field armed with ballams, lathis and other weapons and that the first appellant Logendranath Jha, who was leading the mob, demanded a settlement of all outstanding disputes with the complainant and ,said he would not allow the paddy to be removed unless the disputes were settled.
An altercation followed as a result of which Logendra or dered an assault by his men.
Then Logendra and one of his men, Harihar, gave ballam blows to one of the labourers, Kangali, who fell down and died on the spot.
Information was given to the police who investigated the case and submitted the charge sheet.
The committing Magistrate found that a prima facie case was made out and committed the appellants to the Court of Sessions for trial.
The appellants pleaded not guilty alleging inter alia, that Mohender and Debender, the brothers of Logendra (appel lants 2 and 3) were not present in the village of Dandkhora with which they had no concern, as all the lands in that village had been allotted to Logendra at a previous parti tion, that Logendra himself was not in the village at the time of the occurrence but arrived 678 soon after and was dragged to the place at the instance of his enemies in the village and was placed under arrest by the Assistant Sub Inspector of Police who had arrived there previously.
It was also alleged that there were two factions in the village, one of which was led by one Harimohan, a relation of the complainant, and the other by Logendra and there had been numerous revenue and criminal proceedings and long standing enmity between the families of these leaders as a result of which this false case was foisted upon the appellants.
The learned Sessions Judge examined the evidence in great detail and found that the existence of factions as alleged by the appellants was true.
He found, however, that the appellants ' plea of alibi was not satisfactorily made out, ""but the truth of the prosecution"", he proceeded to observe, ""cannot be judged by the falsehood of the defence nor can the prosecution derive its strength from the weak ness of the defence.
Prosecution must stand on its own legs and must prove the story told by it at the very first stage.
The manner of occurrence alleged by the prosecution must be established beyond doubt before the accused persons can be convicted"".
Approaching the case in this manner and seeing that the basis of the prosecution case was that Polai had batai settlement of the disputed land and had raised the paddy crop which he was harvesting when the occurrence took place, the learned Sessions Judge examined the evidence of the prosecution witnesses who belonged to the opposite faction critically and found that the story of the prosecu tion was not acceptable.
Polai, who was alleged to have taken the land on batai settlement from his own maternal grandmother Parasmani who brought him up from his childhood, was only 19 years old and unmarried and was still living with his grandmother.
He did not claim to be a bataidar of any other person.
""In these circumstances"", said the learned Judge, ""it does not appear to me to be probable that Polai would have been allowed to maintain himself by running adhi cultivation of his mamu 's land in the lifetime of 679 his nani who has brought him up from his infancy like her own child.
Nor does it appeal to me that the unmarried boy Polai would have undertaken upon himself the task of run ning batai cultivation of the lands of his mamu where he has been living since his childhood without any trouble, more particularly in view of the heavy expenses of cultivation brought out by the evidence of Tirthanand (P.W. 14)"".
He, therefore, disbelieved the whole story that Polai had taken the lands of his grandmother or his uncles as bataidar for cultivation and that he was engaged in harvesting the paddy crop on the lands at the time of the occurrence.
This false story, in his opinion, ""vitally affected the prosecution case regarding the alleged manner of the occurrence"".
He also found a number of discrepancies and contradictions in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, which, in his view, tended to show that the prosecution was guilty of concealment of the real facts. ' 'In view of such conceal ment of real facts,"" the learned Judge concluded, ""it does not appear to me to be possible to apportion liability and to decide which of the two parties commenced the fight and which acted in self defence.
Such being the position, it is not possible at all to hold either party responsible for what took place.
In such a view of the matter coupled with the fact that the manner of occurrence alleged by the prose cution has not been established to be true beyond doubt, I think that the accused persons cannot be safely convicted of any of the offences for which they have been charged.
"" The learned Judge accordingly acquitted the appellants of all the charges framed against them.
Against that order the complainant Polai preferred a revision petition to the High Court under section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code., The learned Judge who heard the petition reviewed the evidence at some length and came to the conclusion that the judgment of the learned Sessions Judge could not be allowed to stand as the acquittal of the appellants was ""perverse ' '.
In his opinion, ""the entire judgment displays a lack 680 of true perspective in a case of this kind.
The Sessions Judge had completely misdirected himself in looking to the minor discrepancies in the case and ignoring the essential matters so far as the case is concerned,"" and there was no justifiable ground for rejecting the prosecution evidence regarding the cultivation and harvesting by Polai.
And he concluded with the warning ""I would, however, make it per fectly clear that when the case is re tried, which I am now going to order, the Judge proceeding with the trial will not be in the least influenced by any expression of opinion which I may have given in this judgment.
"" On behalf of the appellants Mr. Sinha raised two conten tions.
In the first place, he submitted that having regard to section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code which provides for an appeal to the High Court from an order of acquittal only at the instance of the Government, a revision petition under section 439 at the instance of a private party was incompetent, and, secondly, that sub section (4) of section 439 clearly showed that the High Court exceeded its powers of revision in the present case in upsetting the findings of fact of the trial Judge. ' We think it is unnecessary to express any opinion on the first contention of Mr. Sinha especially as the respondent is unrepresented, as we are of opinion that his second and alternative contention must prevail.
It will be seen from the judgment summarised above that the learned Judge in the High Court re appraised the evi dence in the case and disagreed with the Sessions Judge 's findings of fact on the ground that they were perverse and displayed a lack of true perspective.
He went further and, by way of ""expressing in very clear terms as to how perverse the judgment of the court below is"", he indicated that the discrepancies in the prosecution evidence and the circum stances of the case which led the Sessions Judge to discred it the prosecution story afforded no justifiable ground for the conclusion that the prosecution failed to establish their case.
We are of opinion that the learned Judge in the High Court did not properly appreciate the 681 scope of inquiry in revision against an order of acquittal.
Though sub section(1) of section 439 authorises the High Court to exercise, in its discretion, any of the powers conferred on a court of appeal by section 423, sub section (4) specifically excludes the power to ""convert a finding of acquittal into one.
of conviction"".
This does not mean that in dealing with a revision petition by a private party against an order of acquittal, the High Court could in the absence of any error on a point of law re appraise the evidence and reverse the findings of facts on which the acquittal was based, provided only it stopped short of finding the accused guilty and passing sentence on him.
By merely characterising the judgment of the trial Court as ""perverse"" and ' lacking in perspective"", the High Court cannot reverse pure findings of fact based on the trial Court 's appreciation of the evidence in the case.
That is what the learned Judge in the court below has done, but could not, in our opinion, properly do on an application in revision filed by a private party against acquittal.
No doubt, the learned Judge formally complied with sub section (4) by directing only a retrial of the appellants without convicting them, and warned that the court retrying the case should not be influenced by any expression of opinion con tained in his judgment.
But there can be little doubt that he loaded the dice against the appellants, and it might prove difficult for any subordinate judicial officer dealing with the case to put aside altogether the strong views expressed in the judgment as to the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and the circumstances of the case in general.
We are of opinion that the learned Judge in the High Court exceeded his powers of revision in dealing with the case in the manner he did, and we set aside his order for retrial of the appellants and restore the order of acquittal passed by the Sessions Judge.
Appeal allowed.

41.txt,"ON: Criminal Appeal No. 11 of 1950.
Appeal under article 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution of India against the Judgment and Order dated the 10th April, 1950, of the High Court of Judicature at Simla in Criminal Revision No. 449 of 1949.
The facts of the case appear in the judgment.
Kundan Lal Arora for the appellant.
S.N. Chopra for the respondent.
May 23.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Bose J.
This is a criminal appeal against a convic tion under section 16 of the Punjab Trade Employees Act, 1940, as amended in 1943, read with section 7(1).
The appellant is a shopkeeper who owns and runs a shop in the Cantonment Area of Ferozepore.
He has no ""employees"" within the meaning of the Act but is assisted by his son in running the shop.
The shop is 673 divided into two sections.
In one, articles of haberdashery are sold; in the other, articles of stationery.
Section 7(1) of the Act as amended requires that ""Save as otherwise provided by this Act, every shop . shall remain closed on a close day.
"" Sub section (2)(i) states that The choice of a close day shall rest with the owner or occupier of a shop . and shall be intimated to the prescribed authority within etc.
"" The appellant made the following choice.
He elected to close the haberdashery section on Mondays and the stationery section on Saturdays and gave the necessary intimation to the prescribed authority to that effect.
On Monday, the 17th of May, 1948, the appellant 's son sold a tin of boot polish to a customer from the haberdash ery, section of the shop.
The appellant was present in person at the time of the sale.
Monday was a close day for the haberdashery section and so the appellant was prosecuted under section 16 read with section 7.
The trying Magistrate held that in selling the article of haberdashery on a close day and in not observing Monday as a close day the appellant had infringed the provisions of section 7(1) of the Act.
He accordingly convicted him and imposed a fine of Rs. 20.
A revision application to the High Court failed.
The High Court held that as the appellant had failed to keep his shop closed one day in the week, his conviction was proper.
A certificate for leave to appeal to this Court, on the ground that a substantial question of law relating to the Govern ment of India Act, 1935, was involved, was granted and that is how we come to be seized of the matter.
The learned counsel for the appellant contended that section 7 of the Act is ultra vires in that it does not fall under any of the items in either the Provincial or the Concurrent Legislative Lists in the Government of India Act, 1935.
In our opinion, the matter can come either under item No. 27 in List II or item No. 27 in List III.
674 Item No. 27 in List II covers ""trade and commerce within the Province.
"" In our opinion, a Provincial Government could, under that entry, regulate the hours, place, date and manner of sale of any particular commodity or commodities.
It could, for example, state that the sale of explosives or other dangerous substances should only be in selected areas, at specified times or on specified days when extra precau tions for the general safety of the public and those direct ly concerned could be arranged for.
That would appear to be obvious.
In the same way, it could, if it so pleased, say that there shall be no sales on a particular day, say a Sunday or a Friday, or on days of religious festivals and so forth.
Instead of doing that, it has chosen to regulate the internal trade of the Province in this manner which is only one of the various ways in which it could have acted.
The matter can also be brought under item 27 in List III: ""welfare of labour; conditions of labour.
"" The im pugned section is a general one and applies to all kinds of shops; that is to say, to those in which labour is employed as well as to those which are run by the owners and their families.
The Act in which the section occurs is directed at regulating the hours of employment of persons who are employed in the business of shops or commercial establish ments.
Therefore, in so far as section 7 covers establish ments where labour is employed, it is undoubtedly intra vires.
But it was argued that the section can have no appli cation to shops which an owner runs with or without the assistance of his family.
Reliance for this was placed on section 2 A (i) and (j) which is as follows: ""2 A. Nothing in this Act shall apply to (i) persons employed in a managerial capacity . and (j) the members of the family of the employer.
"" It was argued that the sale was by the son.
He is not affected by the Act.
Therefore.
he was entitled to sell and he could not sell unless the shop was kept 675 open to enable him to do so.
So also as regards the appel lant, the owner, who was there in a managerial capacity.
In our opinion, this is fallacious because the conviction here is not for the sale but for keeping the shop open on a close day.
Section 2 A (j) does not give the son a right to keep the shop open or, for that matter, a right to sell.
All it says is that he, being a member of the family, shall not be affected by the provisions of the Act.
Section 7(1), on the other hand, is directed against the owner of the shop, not against his family.
It compels the owner to keep his shop closed one day in a week.
It was then contended that if a person employed in a managerial capacity cannot be affected by the Act, then the appellant who was there in that capacity cannot be compelled to close the shop under section 7.
This is also fallacious.
It happens in the present case that the owner and the manag er are the same but the Act obviously makes provision for a class of case in which they are different.
The owner is obliged to close the shop one day in a week, though the manager of the shop can work without, for example, having the twenty four consecutive hours of rest every week which section 7 A enjoins.
The appellant 's capacity as manager will have to be separated from his character as owner for this purpose.
Section 2 A(i) does not control section 7 (1).
Lastly, it was argued that the scheme of the Act makes it plain that it is for ameliorating the conditions of labour employed in shops.
It cannot therefore apply to shops in which no labour is employed, particularly when the family of the ""employer"" is expressly excluded from the purview of the Act.
For this reason also, it cannot fall under item 27 in List III.
We are of opinion that such a narrow interpre tation cannot be placed upon the entry.
The legislature may have felt it necessary, in order to reduce the possibilities of evasion to a minimum, to encroach upon the liberties of those who would not otherwise have been affected.
That we think it had power to do.
Further, to require a shopkeeper, who employs one or two men, to close and 676 permit his rival, who employs perhaps a dozen members of his family, to remain open, clearly places the former at a grave commercial disadvantage.
To permit such a distinction might well engender discontent and in the end react upon the relations between employer and employed.
All these are matters of policy into which we cannot enter but which serve to justify a wide and liberal interpretation of words and phrases in these entries.
The appeal fails and is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.

(1) of the Punjab Trade Employees Act, 1940, as amended in 1943, provided that ""save as otherwise provided by this Act, every shop shall remain closed on a close day.

The appellant owned a shop and on a close day the appellant 's son sold an article from the shop, and the appellant was convicted under section 16 of the Act.
It was contended on his behalf that section 7 of the Act was ultra vires as it did not fall under any of the items in either the Provincial or the Concurrent Legislative List of the Government of India Act, 1935, and that, in any event as he did not employ any labour and was also the manager of the shop he cannot be convicted in view of the provisions of clauses (i) and (j) of section 2 A of the Act.
Held, by the Full Court (i) that the provincial Government could under item No. 27 in List 1I regulate the hours, place, date and manner of sale of any commodity and section 7 of the Act was not ultra vires; the matter could also be brought under item 27 in List III ""welfare of labour; conditions of labour ;"" (ii) clause (j) of section 2 A did not protect the appellant because the conviction was not for the sale by the son but for the appellant having kept the shop open on a close day; (iii) the appellant was not entitled to be exempted under el.

42.txt,"Appeal No. 46 of 1950.
Appeal by special leave from a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay dated 23rd March, 1948, (Chagla C.J. and Tendolkar J.) in Income Tax Reference No. 16 of 1947.
M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (Gopal Singh, with him) for the appellant.
N.C. Chatterjee (B. Sen, with him)for the respondent. 1951.
September 18.
The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MAHAJAN J.
The sole controversy in this appeal centres round the point as to whether or not excess profits tax is payable on the sum of Rs. 20,005 received by the respondent from Messrs Parakh & Co. by way of rent for the dyeing plant let out to them during the chargeable accounting period.
The respondent (Sri Lakshmi Silk Mills Ltd.) is a manu facturer of silk cloth, and as a part of its business it installed a plant for dyeing silk yarn.
During the charge able accounting period (1st January, 1943, to 31st December, 1943) owing to difficulty in obtaining silk yarn on account of the war it could make no use of this plant and it re mained idle for some time.
On the 20th August, 1943, it was let out to Messrs E. Parakh & Co. on a rent of Rs. 4,001 per month.
The Excess Profits Tax Officer by his assessment order dated 11th June, 1945, included the sum of Rs. 20,005 realized as rent for five months, in the profits of the business of the respondent and held that excess profits tax was payable on this amount.
This order was confirmed on appeal by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and on fur ther appeal by the Income tax Tribunal.
The Tribunal, however, on being asked referred the following question of law to the High Court for its opinion: ""Whether in the circumstances of the case, the asses see 's income of Rs. 20,005 is profits from business 3 within the meaning of section 2 (5) of the Excess Profits Tax Act and therefore or otherwise liable to pay excess profits tax ?"" The High Court answered the question in the negative.
This is an appeal by special leave from this decision.
It was contended on behalf of the Commissioner before the High Court that the dyeing plant was a commercial asset of the assessee 's business for the purpose of earning profit and if this commercial asset yielded income to him in any particular manner, it was income from the assessee 's busi ness for the purpose of the Excess Profits Tax Act.
It was said that it was immaterial whether a commercial asset yields income by use of the assessee himself or its being used by someone else.
This contention was disposed of by the learned Chief Justice in these words : ""Mr. Joshi seems to be right but with this qualification that the commercial asset must be at the time it was let out in a condition to be used as a commercial asset by the assessee.
If it has ceased to be a commercial asset, if its use as a commercial asset has been discontinued, then if the assessee lets it out, he is not putting to use something which is a commercial asset at the time.
""Now, on the facts found by the Tribunal, it is clear that when the assessee let out this dyeing plant, it had remained idle for some time.
He could not obtain silk yarn on account of the war and therefore it was not possible to make use of it as a commercial asset as far as the assessee himself was concerned and it was only for that reason that he let it out to Messrs E. Parakh & Co. I can understand the principle for which Mr. Joshi is contending that it makes no difference what an assessee does with a commercial asset belonging to him.
He may use it as he likes.
So long as it yields income it is the income of his business.
Var ious cases have been cited at the Bar and I think that those cases though apparently conflicting are reconcilable if we accept this principle to be the correct principle 4 and apply this ratio as the ratio emerging from these cases and I will state the principle and the ratio again that if an assessee derives income from a commercial asset which is capable at the time of being used as a commercial asset, then it is income from his business, whether he uses that commercial asset himself or lets it out to somebody else to be used.
But if the commercial asset is not capable of being used as such, then its being let out does not result in an income which is the income of the business."" Mr. Justice Tendolkar concurred in this view and ob served as follows : ""The ratio of all these cases to my mind is that if there is a commercial asset which is capable of being worked by the assessee himself for the purpose of earning profits and the assessee instead of doing so, either voluntarily allows someone else to use it on payment of a certain sum or is compelled by law to allow it to be used in such manner, then what he receives is income from business.
But if the commercial asset has ceased to be a commercial asset in the hands of the assessee and thereafter he gets what he can out of it by letting it out to be used by others, then the rent he receives is not income from any business that he carries on.
"" The learned Attorney General pointed out that the nature of a commercial asset is not changed because a par ticular person is unable to use it.
The inability of the assessee to make use of it in certain circumstances does not in any way ' affect the nature of the asset and cause an infirmity in the asset itself.
It was contended that when the dyeing plant became idle for a short time during the chargeable accounting period it did not cease to be a com mercial asset of the respondent for it had no other busi ness; that all the assets of the respondent including the dyeing plant were the assets of the business, that whatever income was derived by the use of these assets including the income that an asset fetched by its being let out was the business income of the assessee, and that there was no warrant 5 in law for the proposition that a commercial asset which yields income must be used as an asset by the respondent himself before its income becomes chargeable to tax.
The learned counsel for the respondent urged that as soon as the assessee found difficulty in obtaining yarn the dyeing plant became redundant for its business and ceased to be an asset of its business and any income derived from the rent by letting out this asset was income received by the assessee from other sources and therefore was not charge able to excess profits tax.
In our opinion, the contention raised by the learned Attorney General is sound.
The High Court was in error in engrafting a proviso on the rule deduced by it from the authorities considered by it, to the effect that a commer cial asset of a business concern which yields income must at the time it was let out be in a condition to be used as a commercial asset by the assessee himself.
We respectfully concur in the opinion of the learned Chief Justice that if the commercial asset is not capable of being used as such, then its being let out to others does not result in an income which is the income of the business, but we cannot accept the view that an asset which was acquired and used for the purpose of the business ceased to be a commercial asset of that business as soon as it was temporarily put out of use or let out to another person for use in his business or trade.
The yield of income by a commercial asset is the profit of the business irrespective of the manner in which.
that asset is exploited by the owner of the business.
He is entitled to exploit it to his best advantage and he may do so either by using it himself personally or by letting it out to somebody else.
Suppose, for instance, in a manufac turing concern the use of its plant and machinery can advan tageously be made owing to paucity of raw materials only for six hours in a working day, and in order to get the best yield out of it, another person who has got the requisite raw materials is allowed to use it as a licensee on payment of certain 6 consideration for three hours; can it be said in such a situation with any justification that ' the amount realized from the licensee is not a part of the business income of the licensor.
In this case the company was incorporated purely as a manufacturing concern with the object of making profit.
It installed plant and machinery for the purpose of its business, and it was open to it if at any time it found that any part of its plant ""for the time being"" could not be advantageously employed for earning profit by the company itself, to earn profit by leasing it to somebody else.
It is difficult to hold that the income thus earned by the commer cial asset is not income from the business of the company that has been solely incorporated for the purpose of doing business and earning profits.
There is no material whatever for taking the view that the assessee company was incorpo rated with any other object than of carrying on business or trade.
Owning properties and letting them was not a purpose for which it was formed and that being so, the disputed income cannot be said to fall under any section of the Indian Income tax Act other than section 10.
Cases of undertakings of this nature stand on an entirely different footing and are distinguishable from cases of individuals or companies acquiring lands or buildings and making income by letting them on hire.
These latter cases may legitimately fall under the specific provisions of section 9 or section 12, though the High Courts in this country are by no means unanimous on this subject; but for the purpose of this case it is unnecessary to resolve that conflict.
It may be observed that no general principle can be laid down which is applicable to all cases, and each case has to be decided on its own circumstances.
Decisions of the Eng lish courts given under the Finance Acts, the scheme of which is different from the Indian Income tax statutes, are not always very helpful in dealing with matters arising under the Indian law and analogies and inferences drawn from those decisions are at times misleading.
We, however, are in respectful agreement with the observations of Lord 7 President Strathclyde in Sutherland vs The Commissioners of Inland Revenue(1) that if a commercial asset is susceptible of being put to a variety of different uses in which gain might be acquired, whichever of these uses it was put to by the appellant, the profit earned was a user of the asset of the same business.
A mere substituted use of the commercial asset does not change or alter the nature of that asset.
Whatever the commercial asset produces is income of the business of which it is an asset, the process by which the asset makes the income being immaterial.
Mr. Chatterjee for the respondent stressed the point that as the dyeing plant in the present case could not be made use of by the assessee in its manufacturing business owing to the non availability of yarn, it ceased to be a commercial asset of the business of the assessee and became redundant to that business and that being so, any income earned by this asset which had ceased to be a commercial asset was not an income of the business but must be held to have been derived from a source other than business and fell within the ambit of section 12 of the Indian Income tax Act, and on this income excess profits tax was not payable.
He contended that the facts of this case were analogous to the case of Inland Revenue Commissioners vs lies(2) and it should be similarly decided.
In that case the taxpayer carried on the business of sand and gravel merchant on certain land and at the same time he granted licences to three firms to enter his land and win gravel for themselves in return for which he received from them a royalty for each cubic yard of gravel taken away.
It was held that the royalties were not part of the profits of the business because, in granting the licences, the taxpayer was exploit ing his rights of ownership in the land and was not carrying on his business of a sand and gravel merchant.
The income was held taxable as an income from an investment and did not fall under Schedule D which concerns profits earned from a trade.
Mr. Chatterjee also laid emphasis on the observations of Lord (1) (2) [1947] 1 A.E.R. 798.
8 Greene M.R. in Croft vs Sywell Aerodrome Ltd. (1), wherein the learned Master of the Rolls observed as fol lows: ""I cannot myself see that a person who leases the land to others, or grants licences to others to come upon it, is doing anything more than exploiting his own rights of property, even if the tenant or licensee is, by the terms of the lease or licence, entitled himself to carry on a trade on the land.
"" It was urged that what the assessee was doing in this case was exploiting his rights of property by letting the dyeing plant to other persons precisely in the same manner as the owner of land in the case cited above was exploiting his own rights to property by granting a licence to another to come on his land.
The argument, in our opinion, though attractive, is fallacious.
The analogy between the case of land and of a dyeing plant for the purpose of taxing stat utes is inappropriate.
The distinction becomes apparent from the following passage which occurs in Atkinson J. 's judgment in I les 's case(2) : ""Then it was suggested by counsel for the Crown that the case was like the Desoutter case(3), where it was held that, if you make use of a patent in your business and also receive royalties from the use of the patent by others licensed to use it, those royalties cannot be regarded as receipts from an investment.
In other words, the door has to be either open or shut.
A patent is either an investment or it is not.
The suggestion was that freehold land is in the same position, and if you carry on business on part of it, whatever you do with the rest by way of licensing or letting cannot be regarded as producing income from investment.
That, however, is dead in the teeth of the judgment in the Broadway Car Co. case(4).
The same argument was tried there, but Tucker L.J. said he thought the Desoutter case(3) had very little to do with it, as there was a great difference between land (1) (3) (2) (4) 9 and a patent, and he did not think the Desoutter case(1) threw any light on the matter .
A patent is quite different from freehold land."" These observations appositely apply to the case of a company incorporated for the purpose of doing business and earning profit by the process of manufacture.
Letting out a part of its machinery in a certain situation in order to make the business advantageous as a whole does not alter the nature of the income.
The case of an owner of land letting out his land and carrying on exploitation of part of that land by selling gravel out of it, as at present advised, in our opinion, would fall under section 9 of the Indian In come tax Act, as income earned, no matter by whatever meth od, from land, and specifically dealt with by that section.
The observations therefore made in I les 's case(2) can have no apposite application to the case of a manufacturing concern letting out a part of its machinery temporarily which it cannot advantageously use itself.
Mr. Chatterjee also laid stress on the decision of the Court of Appeal in Inland Revenue Commissioners vs Broadway Car Co. Ltd.(3).
In this case the company carried on the business of motor car agents and repairers on land held on lease from 1935 to 1956 at an annual rent of pound 750.
By 1940 the company 's business had dwindled under war condi tions to such an extent that no more than one third of the land was required.
In those circumstances the remainder was sublet for fourteen years at an annual rent of pound 1,150.
The general commissioners of income tax decided that the difference of pound 400 between the outgoing of pound 750 for the land retained and the incoming of pound 1,150 for the land disposed of was ""income received from an invest ment,"" and, the business not being one within the special categories mentioned in the Finance Act, 1939, that pound 400 was not taxable.
It was held that the word ""investment"" must be construed in the ordinary, popular sense of the word as used by businessmen and not as a (1) [1946] 1 A.E.R.58.
(3) [1946] 2 A.E.R. 609.
(2) 2 10 term of art having a defined or technical meaning and that it was impossible to say that the commissioners had erred in law in coming to the conclusion that the transaction result ed in an investment.
Scott L.J. in delivering his judgment laid emphasis on the point that after the business of the company had dwindled, it partitioned part of the land from the rest and sublet it by installing a heating apparatus for the sub lessee.
It was found that war conditions had reduced the company 's business to very small proportions and they cut their loss by going out of business in respect of the major part of their land and put it out of their power for 14 years to resume business there.
In this situation it was observed that in that case they were dealing with part of the property of the company which had come redundant and was sublet purely to produce income a transaction.
quite apart from the ordinary business activities of the company.
It was pointed out that the question whether a particular source of income was income or not must be decided, as it could be, according to ordinary commonsense principles.
The short question to decide in this case is whether on the facts found, it could be said reasonably that the dyeing plant had become redundant for its business as a silk manu facturing concern, simply by the circumstance that for the time being it could not be used by it personally for the purpose of dyeing silk yarn owing to the non availability of yarn.
It is difficult to conceive that the company would not have immediately started dyeing yarn as soon as it became available.
Instead of dyeing yarn, another person was allowed to dye jute (we are told), the assessee company making income out of its use as a commercial asset.
In this situation it is not possible to hold that the income thus earned was not a part of the income of the business and was not earned for the business by its commercial asset or that this commercial asset had become redundant to the company 's business of manufacture of silk.
The analogy of Broadway Car Co. Ltd. (1) therefore does not hold good for the decision of the present matter, (1) 11 We are therefore of the opinion that it was a part of the normal activities of the assessee 's business to earn money by making use of its machinery by either employing it in its own manufacturing concern or temporarily letting it to others for making profit for that business when for the time being it could not itself run it.
The High Court therefore was in error in holding that the dyeing plant had ceased to be a commercial asset of the assessee and the income earned by it and received from the lessee, Messrs Parakh & Co., was not chargeable to excess profits tax.
The result therefore is that we hold that the answer returned by the High Court to the question referred to it by the Tribu nal was wrong and that the correct answer to the question would be in the affirmative and not in the negative.
The appeal is allowed, but in the circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs.
We have not thought it necessary to refer to all the cases cited at the Bar as none of them really is in point on the short question that we were called upon to decide and analogies drawn from them would not be helpful in arriving at our decision.
Appeal allowed.

","The respondent, a company formed for the purpose of manufacturing silk cloth, installed a plant for dyeing silk yarn as a part of its Business.
During the chargeable accounting period (last January, 1943, to 31st December, 1943) owing to difficulty in obtaining silk yarn on account of the war, it could make no use of this plant and it re mained idle for some time.
In August, 1943, the plant was let out to another company on a monthly rent.
The question being whether the income received by the respondent company in the year 1948 by way of rent of this plant was income from business and assessable to excess profits tax, the High Court of Bombay held that, as the assessee was not able to use the plant as a commercial asset, it had ceased to be a commercial asset in the assessee 's hands and the rent re ceived was not income from business.
On appeal: Held, that an asset which was acquired and used for the purpose of the business by a company formed for carrying on business and earning profits, does not cease to be a commer cial asset of that business as soon as it is temporarily put out of use or let out to another person for use in his business or trade; the income from the asset would be profit of the business irrespective of the manner in which that asset is exploited by the owner, and the rent in question was therefore income from business and assessable to excess profits tax.
No general principle, however, can be laid down which is applicable to all cases.
Each ease has to be decid ed on its own circumstances.

delivered separate judgment s, KANIA C.J.
In these appeals the question whether the Industrial Tribunal (Bank Disputes) had jurisdiction to make the awards has been directed by the Court to be tried as a preliminary issue. 'the decision depends on the true con struction of sections 7, 8, 15 and 16 of the .
On 384 this question, the agreed statement of facts shows that by a notification of the Government of India dated the 13th June, 1949, the Central Government constituted an Industrial Tribunal 'for the adjudication of industrial disputes in banking companies consisting of Mr. K.C. Sen, chairman, Mr. S.P. Varma and Mr. J.N. Mazumdar.
A second notification dated the 24th August, 1949, was thereafter issued as follows :""In exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (1) of section 8 of the , the Central Government was pleased to appoint Mr. N. Chandrasekhara Aiyar as a member of the Industrial Tribunal constituted by the notifications of the Government of India in the Ministry of Labour dated the lath June, 1949, in the place of Mr. S.P. Varma whose services have ceased to be available.
"" The Tribunal commenced its regular sittings at Bombay from the 12th to the 16th of September, 1949.
It thereafter sat at Delhi and Patna between the 19th September, 1949, and 3rd April, 1950.
Further sittings were held, at some of which Mr. Mazumdar was absent on various dates and Mr. Chandrasek hara Aiyar was absent from the 23rd November, 1949, to the 20th of February, 1950, as his services were placed at the disposal of the Ministry of External Affairs as a member of the Indo Pakistan Boundary Disputes Tribunal.
Between the 23rd November, 1949, and 20th February 1950, Mr. Sen and Mr. Mazumdar together sat at several places and made certain awards.
Those awards have been accepted by the Government under section 15 of the Act and published in the Gazette as the awards of the Tribunal.
The Tribunal held its sittings in Bombay to hear general issues from the 16th January, 1950, and concluded them on the 3rd April, 1950.
In the agreed statement of facts, it is stated that the services of Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar were not available to the Tribunal from the afternoon of 23rd November, 1949, to the forenoon of 20th February, 1950.
From the 16th January, 1950, up to 20th February, 1950, several matters, particularly including 15 items covering, inter alia, Issues 1, 2, 3, 4, 15, 23, 27, 28, 33, 34, 37 385 and dealing with the question of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in respect of officers regarding banks having branches in more than one Province and banks in liquidation, question of retrospective effect to be given to the award, question relating to provident and guarantee fund and allow ances to special categories of workmen, were dealt with by the Tribunal.
From the notes of the proceedings of the Tribunal it appears that as numerous banks and workmen were parties to the proceedings, some workmen who had not found it convenient to attend throughout appeared and put forth their views in respect of the aforesaid issues and questions after Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar started his work from the afternoon of the 20th February, 1950, again by sitting with Mr. Sen and Mr. Mazumdar.
The jurisdiction of the Tribunal of the aforesaid three persons to make the award is disputed on two grounds: (1) That when Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar 's services ceased to be available, as mentioned in the agreed statement of facts, the remaining two members had to be re appointed to consti tute a Tribunal.
(2) That when Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar began to sit again with Mr. Sen and Mr. Mazumdar from the forenoon of 20th February, 1950, it was imperative to issue a notification constituting a Tribunal under section 7 of the .
The argument is that in the absence of Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar the two members had no jurisdiction to hear anything at all without the appropriate notification and that Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar 's services having ceased to be available on the 23rd of November, 1949.
he cannot sit again with the other two members to form the Tribunal in the absence of a notification under section 7.
In order to appreciate the correct position, it is necessary to consider the scheme of the .
It envisages the establishment of a Conciliation Board, a Court of Inquiry and a Tribunal for adjudication.
Rele vant portions of sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 15 and 16 of the Act which only are material for the present discussion run as follows: 50 386 5.
(1) ""The appropriate Government may as occasion arises by notification in the official Gazette constitute a Board of Conciliation for promoting the settlement of an industrial dispute.
(2) A Board shall consist of a chairman and two or four other members, as the appropriate Government thinks fit.
(3) The chairman shall be an independent person and the other members shall be persons appointed in equal numbers to represent the parties to the dispute and any person appoint ed to represent a party shall be appointed on the recommen dation of that party: * * * (4) A Board, having the prescribed quorum, may act notwithstanding the absence of the chairman or any of its members or any vacancy in ifs number.
Provided that if the appropriate Government notifies the Board that the services of the chairman or any other member have ceased to be available, the Board shall not act until a new chairman or member, as the case may be, has been ap pointed.
(1) ""The appropriate Government may as occasion arises by notification in the official Gazette constitute a Court of Inquiry for inquiring into any matter appearing to be connected with or relevant to an industrial dispute.
(2) A Court may consist of one independent person or of such number of independent persons as the appropriate Government may think fit and where a Court consists of two or more members, one of them shall be appointed as the chairman.
(3) A Court, having the prescribed quorum, may act notwithstanding the absence of the chairman or any of its members or any vacancy in its number.
Provided that, if the appropriate Government noti fies the Court that the services of the chairman have ceased to be available, the Court shall not act until a new chair man has been appointed.
(1) ""The appropriate Government may constitute one or more Industrial Tribunals for the 387 adjudication of industrial disputes in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
(2) A Tribunal shall consist of such number of members as the appropriate Government thinks fit.
Where the Tribunal consists of two or more members, one of them shall be ap pointed as the chairman.
(3) Every member of the Tribunal shall be an independent person, (a) who is or has been a Judge of a High Court or a District Judge, or (b) is qualified for appointment as a Judge of a High Court: Provided that the appointment to a Tribunal of any person not qualified under part (a) shall be made in consul tation with the High Court of the Province in which the Tribunal has, or is intended to have, its usual place of sitting.
(1) ""If the services of the chairman of a Board or the chairman or other member of a Court or Tribunal cease to be available at any time, the appropriate Government shall in the case of a chairman, and may in the case of any other member, appoint another independent person to fill the vacancy, and the proceedings shall be continued before the Board, Court or Tribunal so reconstituted.
(2) Where a Court or Tribunal consists of one person only and his services cease to be available the appropriate Government shall appoint another independent person in his place, and the proceedings shall be continued before the person so appointed.
(3) Where the services of any member of a Board other than the chairman have ceased to be available, the appropri ate Government shall appoint in the manner specified in sub section (3) of section 5 another person to take his place, and the proceedings shall be continued before the Board so reconstituted.
(1) ""Where an industrial dispute has been referred to a Tribunal for adjudication, it shall hold its proceed ings expeditiously and shall, as soon as 388 practicable on the conclusion thereof, submit its award to the appropriate Government.
(2) On receipt of such award, the appropriate Government shall by order in writing declare the award to be binding: * * * (4) Save as provided in the proviso to sub section (3) of section 19, an award declared to be binding under this section shah not be called in question in any manner.
""The report of a Board or Court and the award of a Tribunal shall be in writing and shall be signed by all the members of the Board, Court or Tribunal, as the case may be: Provided that nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent any member of the Board, Court or Tribunal from recording a minute of dissent from a report or award from any recommendation made therein.
"" Confining our attention to the aspect of absence of members at the sittings of the different bodies and what results follow therefrom, it is clear that under section 5 (4) when a member of a Board of Conciliation is absent or there is a vacancy, the Board is permitted to act, notwith standing such absence, provided there is the prescribed quorum.
Such quorum is fixed by the rules framed under the Act.
According to the proviso to this sub section however, if the appropriate Government notifies the Board that the services of the chairman or any other member have ceased to be available, the Board shall not act until a new chairman or a member, as the case may be, has been appointed.
Read ing these two parts together, it is therefore clear that a distinction is drawn between the situation arising from the absence of the chairman or any of its members and a vacancy in the Board, and the position when the Government has intimated that the services of a chairman or member have ceased to be available.
The words ""having the prescribed quorum"" put a further limitation on the right of the 389 remaining members of the Board to act, when all of them are not acting together.
The proviso thus makes it clear that when the services of a chairman or member have ceased to be available and that fact has been notified to the Board by the appropriate Government, the remaining members have no jurisdiction to act in the name of the Board.
Thus all the contingencies of temporary or casual absence, as well as permanent vacancy, and the contingency of the chairman or a member 's services having ceased to be available are con templated and provided for.
In the same way and in the same terms, provision is made in respect of the Court of In quiry in section 6 (3).
The provisions as regards the Tribunal are found in section 7.
No other section deals with the establishment of the Tribunal.
The first clause empowers the appropriate Government to constitute one or more industrial tribunals having the functions allotted to it under the Act.
Sub clause (2) provides that a Tribunal shall consist of such number of members as the appropriate Government thinks fit.
This clause therefore authorizes the appropriate Government to fix the number of members which will constitute the Tribunal.
Sub clause (3) and the proviso deal with the qualifications of individuals to be members with which we are not concerned.
Although in this section there is no provision like sections 5 (1) and 6 (1) requiring a notification of the constitution of the Tribunal in the official Gazette, the deficiency is made up by rule 5 of the Industrial Disputes Rules; 1949, framed by the Gov ernment under section 38 of the Act.
The rule provides that the appointment of a Board, Court or Tribunal ""together with the names of the persons constituting the Board, Court or Tribunal ' shall be notified in the official Gazette.
It is therefore obligatory on the appropriate Government to notify the composition of the Tribunal and also the names of the persons constituting the same.
In respect of a Tribunal which is entrusted with the work of adjudicating upon dis putes between employers and employees which have not been settled otherwise, this provision 390 s absolutely essential.
It cannot be left in doubt to the employers or the employees as to who are the persons authorized to adjudicate upon their disputes.
This is also in accordance with notifications of appointments of public servants discharging judicial or quasijudicial functions.
The important thing therefore to note is that the number forming the Tribunal and the hames of the members have both to be notified in the official Gazette for the proper and valid constitution of the Tribunal.
It is significant that there is no provision correspond ing to section 5 (4) or 6 (3) in section 7.
Section 15 of the Act provides that when an industrial dispute has been referred to a Tribunal for adjudication, it shall hold its proceedings expeditiously and as soon as practicable and at the conclusion thereof submit its award to the appropriate Government.
It is thus clear and indeed it is not disputed that the tribunal as body should sit together and the award has to be he result of the joint deliberations of all mem bers of he Tribunal acting in a joint capacity.
Section 16 requires that all members of the Tribunal shall sign he award.
This again emphasizes that the function of the Tribunal is joint and it is not open to any member to re frain from signing the award.
If the award is not signed by all members it will be invalid is it will not be the award of the Tribunal.
In the light of the provisions of section 7 the question arising for consideration is, what was the duty of the Government when the services of Mr. Chandrashekhara Aiyar ceased to be available.
The two telegrams exchanged between Mr. Sen and the Government show that the Government took the view that a vacancy had occurred and they did not think of filling it up at the time.
In the first place, on the true construction of the Act, was it not obligatory on the Gov ernment to notify to the contesting parties that it had decided not to fill up the vacancy ? Is it open to them to leave the parties in doubt in respect of a Tribunal entrust ed with the work of adjudicating upon very important dis putes between parties ? In our opinion, the whole 391 scheme of the Act leads to the conclusion that the Govern ment must notify its decision as to what it desired to do, i.e., whether it intended to fill up the vacancy or not and thereupon notify what members were going to constitute the Tribunal.
We are led to that conclusion because a Tribunal of three consisting of Mr. Sen, Mr. Mazumdar and Mr. Chan drasekhara Aiyar is a different tribunal from one consisting of two, viz., of Mr. Sen and Mr. Mazumdar only.
In this setting, it is next necessary to consider the words of section 8 on which strong reliance is placed on behalf of the respondents.
The marginal note of that sec tion is ""filling of vacancies "".
The section deals with the Board, the Court and the Tribunal in its clauses.
Under sub section (1), the Legislature clearly contemplates that when the services of a member cease to be available at any time there will arise a vacancy.
This sub section deals with the situation in three stages.
The first question is, have the services of a member (and this includes, for the present discussion,.
a chairman)ceased to be available ? If so, the vacancy having thus arisen, the next question is, what can be done by the appropriate Government ? If the vacancy is filled up by making the appointment, the final question is, how the proceedings shall go on before the Board, Court or Tribunal so reconstituted ? It was argued on behalf of the respondents that it was for the appropriate Government alone to pronounce whether the services of a member had ceased to be available at any time and that was not a matter for the decision of the Court.
In our opinion, what is left to the option of the Government is, in case of the services of a member ceasing to be available, to appoint or not to appoint.
Those stages having passed, the appro priate Government, under the section, is obliged to appoint another person to fill the vacancy, if the vacancy is creat ed in respect of a chairman.
In respect of the vacancy of a member 's post, the Government is given the option to appoint or not to appoint another person.
The concluding words of the sub section ""so reconstituted"" clearly relate only to the contingency of 392 the Government making the appointment of another independent person in the vacancy.
The concluding part of that sub section provides for the continuance of the proceedings before the body so reconstituted.
Subsection (2) also pro vides that where a court or tribunal consists only of one person and his services have ceased to be available, on the appointment of another independent person the proceedings shall be continued before the person so appointed and it will not be necessary to start the proceedings from the beginning before that person.
Section 8 (3) provides for the contingency of the services of a member of a Board not being available.
It requires the appropriate Government to make the appointment as provided in section 5 (3) and fur ther provides that notwithstanding the inclusion of a total ly new man in that vacancy, the proceedings shall be contin ued before the Board so reconstituted.
Reading the three clauses together, therefore, it is quite clear that the object of section 8 is to make specific provisions in re spect of situations when the Government must or does fill up vacancies in the event of the services of a member or chair man not being available and the consequences of a totally new man filling up the vacancy.
As we read the Act, that is the total object and intention of this section.
It does not contemplate the consequences of the Government not making an appointment where it has the option not to do so.
The emphasis on the words ""so reconstituted ' ' in sub sections (1) and (3) and the concluding words of each of those clauses clearly bear out this intention of the legislature.
It was argued that although no provision is made in section 8 (1) about what is to happen if the Government did not fill up the vacancy, it is implied that in that event the remaining members can continue the work.
We are unable to accept that argument.
In the first place, as pointed out above, the object of section 8 is to provide in what cases vacancies must be filled up and how the proceedings should continue on the vacancy being filled up.
It does not deal at all with the situation arising from the not filling up of the 393 vacancy by the Government.
In this connection the provi sions of sections 5 (4) and 6 (a) have been already noted.
When the legislature wanted to provide that in spite of the temporary absence or permanent vacancy the remaining members should be authorised to proceed with the work they have made express provision to that effect.
If in the case of a Board or Court of Inquiry, neither of which is adjudicating any disputes, such a provision was considered necessary to enable the remaining members to act as a body, we think that the absence of such provision in respect of the Tribunal, which adjudicates on the disputes and whose quasi judicial work is admittedly of a joint character and responsibility leads to the irresistible conclusion that in the absence of one or more members the rest are not competent to act as a Tribunal at all.
Again the provisos to sections 5 (4) and 6 (3) are important.
Under those provisos when the Government intimates to the remaining members that the services of one ""have ceased to be available"" the rest have no right to act as the Board or Court.
It appears under the circumstances proper to hold that in respect of a Tribunal when the serv ices of a member have ceased to be available, the rest by themselves have no right to act as the Tribunal.
The question which we have got to consider can be divid ed in two stages.
On the appointment of Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar as a member of the Boundary Tribunal, did his services cease to be available within the meaning of section 8, and thereby was a vacancy created? The parties have put before us only two telegrams exchanged between the chairman and Mr. Mazumdar on the one hand and the Central Government on the other, to reach our conclusion about the situation arising from Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar joining the Boundary Tribunal.
Certain Government notifications published 'in May and June, 1950, i.e., over three or four months after Mr. Chandrasek hara Aiyar finished his work on the Boundary Tribunal, have been put before us, but in our opinion these 394 ex post facto notifications cannot help us in deciding the important question under section 8.
It is obvious that, on the date the appointment of Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar as a member of the Boundary Tribunal was made, it could not have been known how long that Tribunal would take to complete its work.
In any event, the evidence put before us as of that date does not show that the appointment was for a short time.
The Boundary Tribunal 's work may have lasted for a month or a year.
Having regard to the urgency and the necessity of quick disposal of industrial disputes recog nised in section 15, the deputation of a member of such a Tribunal to another Tribunal, whose work may be of an indef inite duration, obviously makes the services of the member cease to be available to the Industrial Tribunal within the meaning of section 8 so as to bring about a vacancy.
The later statement in the Government notification of May, 1950, that Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar 's services were lent to the External Affairs Ministry ""from the 23rd of November, 1949, to the 20th of February, 1950, "" appears to be more a noti fication for the purpose of the Accountant General and the Audit departments of the Government than a disclosure of the mind of the Government when the appointment was made on the 23rd of November.
When Mr. Sen, as chairman, and Mr. Mazum dar held their first sitting in the absence of Mr. Chandra sekhara Aiyar, an objection was raised about the constitu tion of the Tribunal.
Thereupon Mr. Sen and Mr. Mazumdar conveyed to the Government what had happened at the meeting.
The Government was therefore clearly faced with the problem as to what it wanted to do.
The reply telegram from the Government asked Mr. Sen and Mr. Mazumdar to go on with the proceedings.
It further stated that the Government might fill up the vacancy later on.
The question for considera tion is, what is the effect of this telegram of the Govern ment ? In the light of the provisions of section 8 that telegram can only mean that the Government had decided not to fill up the vacancy.
If a vacancy had occurred they had to make the appointment or state that they will 395 not do so.
They cannot defer their decision on the question of filling up the vacancy and in the interval direct the remaining members to go on with the reference.
That seems to us to be the correct position because the fundamental basis on which the Tribunal has to do its work is that all members must sit and take part in its proceedings jointly.
If a member was casually or temporarily absent owing to illness, the remaining members cannot have the power to proceed with the reference in the name of the Tribunal, having regard to the absence of any provision like section 5 (4) or 6 (3) in respect of the tribunal.
The Government had notified the constitution of this Tribunal by the two notifications summarized in the earlier part of the judg ment and thereby had constituted the Tribunal to consist of three members and those three were Mr. Sen, Chairman, Mr. Mazumdar and Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar.
Proceeding with the adjudication in the absence of one, undermines the basic principle of the joint work and responsibility of the Tribu nal and of all its members to make the award.
Moreover, in their telegram the Government had not suggested that no vacancy had occurred.
Indeed, they recognised the fact of a vacancy having occurred but stated that they might make the appointment later on.
If those words are properly construed, without any outside considerations, it is clear that the Government intended that the remaining two members of the Tribunal should proceed with the adjudication as a Tribunal.
This direction in fact was accepted and the two members proceeded with the reference and made certain awards.
Those awards were sent to the Government under section 15 (2) and the Government by its order declared the awards to be bind ing, and published them in the official Gazette.
Those awards are signed only by Mr. Sen and Mr. Mazumdar.
Reading those awards with the notifications and the provisions of sections 15 and 16 it is therefore clear that between 23rd November, 1949, and 20th February, 1950, the Government ' 'intended"" the tribunal to consist only of Mr. Sen and Mr. Mazumdar.
It was not and 396 cannot be seriously disputed that in the event of the Gov ernment deciding to fill up the vacancy, a notification had to be issued.
The question is, why and under what rule ? The answer clearly is that they had to do it because of rule 5.
The reason why intimation of a new man forming a member of the Tribunal has to be publicly given, in our opinion, applies with equal force when a tribunal initially consti tuted of three persons, viz., Mr. Sen, Mr. Mazumdar and Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar, is, by the Government decision, as from a certain date, to be a tribunal of Mr. Sen and Mr. Mazumdar only.
The word ""reconstituted"" is properly used in section 8 because when a new member is introduced in the panel so far performing its duties, it is a reconstitution, but the words of section 8 do not exclude the obligation on the Government to issue a notification under rule 5 when there is not a reconstitution, but a new constitution of the Tribunal.
The Government, however, did not give effect to its intention by issuing a fresh notification under section 7.
Therefore, when the services of Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar ceased to be available and they decided that another inde pendent person was not to be appointed to fill the vacancy, there arose the situation when only two members constituted the Tribunal and for the constitution of such Tribunal no notification under section 7 of the Act was issued.
To enable such a Tribunal of two persons to function, under the provisions of the Act, a notification under section 7 of the Act, in our opinion, was absolutely essential.
The work of the two members in the absence of such a notification cannot be treated as the work of a Tribunal established under the Act and all their actions are without jurisdiction.
It was argued on behalf of the respondents that when Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar left for the Boundary Tribunal, there arose a temporary absence which it w, as not necessary to fill up and the remaining two members had jurisdiction under the Act to proceed with the adjudication.
In our opinion, this contention cannot be accepted.
In the first place, in the agreed statement of facts, it is not stated that there was any temporary 397 absence.
Again, as we have pointed out the Government by its telegram of the 29th of November accepted the position that a vacancy had occurred and no question of temporary absence therefore arises for our consideration.
An analogy sought to be drawn between the temporary absence on leave or on depu tation of a Judge is misleading having regard to the fact that under section 7 the Government has to decide at the initial stage how many members and who will constitute the Tribunal and have to notify the same.
That step having been taken, it is not within the power or competence of the Government to direct a few members only of such Tribunal to proceed with the adjudication for however short or long time it be.
In our opinion, section 8 has no application to that situation.
In this connection, it may be useful to notice that under rule 12 it was provided that ""when a Tribunal consists of two or more members, the tribunal may, with the consent of the parties, act notwithstanding any casual vacancy in its number . ""This rule clearly shows that even when there was a casual vacancy and the remaining members desired to proceed with the work they could do so only with the consent of the parties.
This rule framed under section 38 of the Act strongly supports the contention that if the Act impliedly gave power under section 8 to the remaining two members of the Tribunal to act, as contended on behalf of the respondents, there was no necessity at all for making this rule.
Although this rule was repealed on the 3rd of December, it was in operation when the services of Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar ceased to be available to the Tribunal as from the 23rd of November.
If in the case of temporary absence, the consent of the parties was essential to enable the remaining members to act, it certainly follows that the objection to their working as a 'tribunal when there is no consent and the absence is not casual, but is due to the services of one of the members having ceased to be available, is fatal.
It follows therefore that all awards made by Mr. Sen and Mr. Mazumdar, after the services of Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar ceased to be available, were 398 not made by a tribunal duly constituted under section 7 and those awards are therefore void.
It was contended that by directing Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar to work again as a member of the Banks Tribunal in February, 1950, the Government had filled up the vacancy under section 8.
In our opinion this position cannot be supported on the admitted facts.
As regards filling up of a vacancy under section 8, we have already noticed that by directing the remaining two members to proceed with the work and by notifying their awards as the awards of the Tribunal the Government must be considered to have intended not to fill up the vacancy.
Again, the later notification pub lished in June, 1950, does not even state that Mr. Chandra sekhara Aiyar was appointed a member of the Tribunal ""in any vacancy.
"" The word used there is ""resumed"" suggesting there by that he had gone out for the time being but had started the work again.
Under the circumstances and in the absence of any other evidence, we are unable to consider the fact of Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar sitting along with the two members from and after the 20th February, 1950, as an appointment by the Government in the vacancy created by his appointment to the Boundary Tribunal in November, 1949.
At one stage it was suggested that the members of the Tribunal could delegate their work to a few members only and the award can be supported in that way.
Apart from the question what work could be so delegated, it was ascertained that the Rule permitting delegation was first published on 3rd December, 1949, and as Mr. Chandrasekhara Aiyar had gone to his work on the Boundary Tribunal on 23rd November, no delegation in that manner was possible.
Moreover, the state ment of facts nor the award of the three persons suggests that there was any delegation of work by the Tribunal in the matter of the general issues to some members only.
Nor was an","The Central Government constituted an Industrial Tribu nal under the , consisting of A, B, and C 381 for deciding certain disputes and the Tribunal commenced its sittings in September, 1949.
On the 23rd November, 1949, the services of C were placed at the disposal of the Minis try of External Affairs as a member of the Indo Pakistan Boundary Disputes Tribunal, and the two remaining members, after an objection raised by one side, continued to sit and hear the disputes.
On the 20th February, 1950, C returned from the Boundary Disputes Tribunal and began to sit again with the other two members and hear the further proceedings in the case of disputes which were part heard and not finally decided on that date.
On the 20th May, 1950, the Government issued a notification that C had"" resumed charge of his duties as a member of the All India Industrial Tribu nal"".
Some awards were made by A and B before the 20th February, 1950, and some awards were made after that date by A, B and C together.

382 Per FAZL ALI and PATANJALI SASTRI JJ.
(contra) There was a 'vacancy ' within the meaning of Sec. 8 of the Act when the services of C were placed at the disposal of the Bound ary Disputes Tribunal, which provided an occasion for the Government to exercise the discretion vested in it under Sec. 8 of the Act to fill up the vacancy or not.
The fact that the Government decided not to fill up the vacancy, could not render the Tribunal an imperfectly constituted Tribunal, and the proceedings could validly be continued before the Tribunal in spite of the vacancy.
Further, since the vacancy was a temporary one and was not filled up, C did not cease to be a member of the Tribunal and could therefore rejoin it as soon as he was free from the duties of his new office.
Even if it be assumed that it was necessary for the Government to make an appointment under Sec. 8 (1), the requirements of that section were complied with, when C joined under the orders of the Government and that fact was also notified by the Government on the 20th May, 1950.
Rule 5 of the Industrial Disputes Rules applies only when a Tribunal is initially constituted.
It does not apply to appointments to fill vacancies.
Per MUKHERJEA J. An Industrial Tribunal can be consti tuted only in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 7 of the and unless a Tribunal is proper ly constituted, it cannot be invested with jurisdiction to adjudicate on industrial disputes.
Under sub sec.
(2) of Sec. 7, the number of members constituting the Tribunal has to be determined by the appropriate Government and a change in the number of members could be made therefore only in pursuance of the provision contained in that sub section.
As Sec. 8 does not lay down that, in case the services of a. member of the Tribunal cease to be available and the Govern ment does not choose to make a new appointment in his place, the remaining members should continue to form the 'tribunal, the constitution or reconstitution of the remaining members as a Tribunal could be made only under Sec. 7 of the Act and as there was n9 notification by the appropriate Government under Sec. 7 constituting the two remaining members a Tribu nal under the Act during the absence of C, the proceedings before these two members and the awards made and signed by them only during C 's absence were void.
But, there was no necessity for a fresh notification and a fresh constitution of the Tribunal when the absent member returned as the original notification was still there unaltered and unamend ed, and by virtue of this notification alone, the three members would be competent to sit as a Tribunal and dis charge its duties.
The Tribunal was thefore, properly constituted from the 20th February, 1950, and the awards made by all the three members after that date were not void for want of jurisdiction in the Tribunal.

October 4.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
These two criminal appeals are from convictions of the appellants by the High Court at Calcutta.
In the first case, leave to appeal to this Court was granted by the High Court under article 134(1)(c) of the Constitu tion of India.
In the second case, special leave to appeal was granted by this Court under article 136(1) of the Con stitution.
The appeals were heard together, but as they are by different parties and the facts are different, it is desirable to have two separate judgments.
Criminal Appeal No. 7 of 1950.
The appellant, Joylal Agarwala, who was a salesman in a retail shop in Pulbazar in the district of Darjeeling in the State of West Bengal, was charged with having sold a piece of textile cloth at a price in excess of the controlled price.
For this contravention of the provisions of clause 24 (1) of the Cotton Textiles Control Order, 1948, he was convicted by the Sub Divisional Magistrate of Darjeeling under section 7 of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act (Act XXIV) of 1946 (herein after referred to as the Essential Supplies Act), and sentenced to six months ' rigor ous imprisonment.
On appeal to the Sessions Judge, the appellant was acquitted on two grounds, viz., (1) that no sanction was previously obtained for the prosecution as required by clause 36 of the Cotton Textiles Control Order, and (2) that the Essential Supplies Act was not in force in the district of Darjeeling on the date of the occurrence.
On appeal to the High Court by the State of West Bengal, the point about the absence of sanction under clause 36 of the Control Order was given up by the present appellant as its necessity had been abolished by a later Notification of the Central Government.
On the second point, the learned Judges of the High Court held that the Act was validly extended to the district of Darjeeling and was in force in that area on the date of the occurrence, viz., 14 10 1949.
The acquittal of the appellant 130 was set aside, the order of conviction passed by the Magistrate was restored, and the appellant was sentenced to four months ' rigorous imprisonment.
To understand the main legal argument as to whether the Essential Supplies Act of 1946 was in force at the time of the alleged commission of the offence, it is necessary to set out the relevant provisions of a few Acts and Orders and their dates.
The Essential Supplies Act came into force on 19 11 1946.
Section 92(1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, provided as follows : "" . no Act of the Federal Legislature or of the Provincial Legislature, shall apply to an excluded area or a partially excluded area, unless the Governor by public notification so directs, and the Governor in giving such a direction with respect to any Act may direct that the Act shall in its application to the area, . . have effect subject to such exceptions or modifications as he thinks fit.
"" In exercise of the powers conferred on him by this section, the Governor of Bengal by a notification published on the 14th December, 1946, directed that the Essential Supplies Act shall apply to the district of Darjeeling, which was an excluded area.
Section 1(3) of the Essential Supplies Act provides that it shall cease to have effect on the expiration of the period mentioned in section 4 of the India (Central Govern ment and Legislature) Act, 1946 (9 & 10 Geo.
6, Ch. 39).
Section 4 of the latter Act provides as follows : ""The period mentioned. is the period of one year beginning with the date on which the Proclamation of Emer gency in force at the passing of this Act ceases to operate or, if the Governor General by public notification so di rects, the period of two years beginning with that date: Provided that if and so often as a resolution approving the extension of the said period is passed by both Houses of Parliament, the said period shall be extended for a further period of twelve months from 131 the date on which it would otherwise expire so, however, that it does not in any case continue for more than five years from the date on which the Proclamation of Emergency ceases to operate.
"" The Proclamation of Emergency referred to in this sec tion ceased to operate on 31 3 1946.
In the absence of a notification by the Governor General under the second part of the section, the Essential Supplies Act remained opera tive only till 31 3 1947, under the first part.
The Gover nor General, however, issued a notification on 3 3 1947 continuing its force for a period of 2 years from the date of cessation of emergency.
By virtue of this notification, therefore, the Essential Supplies Act would remain in force till 31 3 1948.
On 18 7 1947, the Indian Independence Act was passed, and India became a Dominion on 15 8 1947.
Under section 9 read with section 19(4) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, the GOvernor General passed an Order on 14 8 1947, which substituted the words ""Dominion Legislature"" for"" both Houses of Parliament"" in the proviso to section 4 of the India (Central Government and Legislature) Act, 1946, and also introduced a new section 4A by way of adapta tion, providing that the powers of the Dominion Legislature shall be exercised by the Constituent Assembly.
On 25 2 1948, the Constituent Assembly passed its first resolution extending the operation of the Essential Supplies Act by one year up to 31 3 1949.
On 23 3 1949, a second resolution was passed by the Assembly extending the life of the Act by one more year up to 31 3 1950.
In respect of these Acts and notifications three ques tions were urged on behalf of the appellant: firstly, wheth er the Governor 's notification of the 14th December, 1946, continued the operation of the Essential Supplies Act in the district of Darjeeling beyond the then period of life of the Act, namely, the period of one year from the date of cessa tion of emergency; secondly, whether a fresh notification by the Governor under section 92(1) of the Government of India Act was not necessary.
after the life of the Essential 132 Supplies.
Act was extended by the Governor General 's noti fication of 3 3 1947; and thirdly, whether the resolutions passed by the Constituent Assembly could operate to extend the life of the Essential Supplies Act.
Now, it is clear that under section 1 (3) of the Essen tial Supplies Act, it shall cease to have effect on the expiration of the period mentioned in section 4 of the India (Central Government and Legislature) Act, 1946.
The period mentioned in that section is not necessarily one year from the date of cessation of emergency.
It can be 2 years if the Governor General by notification so directs, and it may go up to a maximum period of 5 years in instalments of 1 year each, under the proviso.
The fixation of the period of operation of the Essential Supplies Act is thus not left to any other enactment.
It is provided by the Act itself.
As stated already, the notification of the 14th December, 1946, issued by the Governor applied the Essential Supplies Act to the Darjeeling district, and its life was extended up to 31 3 1948 by the notification of the Governor General.
It is difficult to see why a fresh notification under section 92 (1) of the Government of India Act is required to continue the life of the Act in the district of Darjeeling.
The Governor 's notification extended the Act to Darjeeling without specifying any particular period for its applicabil ity to that district, and it follows therefore that the Act would remain in force in the district so long as it remained in force in the rest of India.
It is only if its effect had ceased earlier than the coming into force of the Indian Independence Act and there was a reenactment by the legisla ture which was sought to be applied to an excluded area, that a notification by the Governor under section 92 (1) of the Government of India Act might be necessary.
Otherwise, the question of a fresh notification does not arise.
Section 19(4) of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, provides as follows: ""In this Act, except so far as the context otherwise requires 133 References to the Government of India Act, 1935, include references to any enactments amending or supplementing that Act, and, in particular, references to the India '(Central Government and Legislature) Act, 1946; . "" The adaptations made by the Governor General under sections 9 and 19 of the Indian Independence Act substituted the words ""ConstitUent Assembly"" for ""both Houses of Parlia ment"" in section 4 of the India (Central Government and Legislature) Act, and the Constituent Assembly by two reso lutions of different dates has extended the life of the Essential Supplies Act till 31 3 1950.
As soon as the adap tations came into force by order of the Governor General, the Constituent Assembly acquired the powers conferred on both Houses of Parliament under section 4 of the India (Central Government and Legislature) Act.
The validity of the adaptations is beyond question.
The case of Jatindra Nath Gupta vs The Province of Bihar and Others(1) has no application here.
In the case now before us, the Legislature has itself applied its mind and has fixed the duration of the Act, but has left the machin ery to reach the maximum period by instalments to be worked out in a particular manner.
There is here no question of delegation at all, much less delegation of any legislative power.
The appeal therefore fails and is dismissed.
Criminal Appeal No. 25 of 1951.
In this case, the appellant Bichan Chand Molla was charged with loading 28 bags of millmade cloth from a truck into a specially chartered aircraft at the Dum Dum airport, on behalf of his employers, Messrs. Amarchand Pannalal, without a permit, as required under clause 4 (2) of the West Bengal Cotton Cloth and Yarn Movement Control Order, 1947.
He was convicted under section 7 (1) read with section 8 of the Essential Supplies Act and sentenced to 9months ' rigor ous imprisonment and a fine Of Rs. 1,000 by the (1) 18 134 1st Class Magistrate of Barrackpore.
The Sessions Judge of 24 Parganas dismissed the appeal preferred by the accused.
A revision application filed by him in the High Court shared the same fate.
The legal argument urged in this appeal was the same as in the earlier appeal, and has to be repelled as untenable for the reasons already stated.
A special point was sought to be argued that the element of mens rea was want ing.
But the question was considered by the High Court, and it was held that there are two facts from which mens tea could be inferred.
When questioned, the accused stated that he was.loading handloom bales and not millmade cloth.
He had no permit with him and was not able to produce any even from his employers.
These facts under the circumstances warrant the inference of a criminal intent.
This appeal also will therefore stand dismissed.

","The Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act (XXIV Of 1946) came into force on 19th November, 1946.
By a notifica tion 128 of 14th December, 1946, under section 92 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, the Governor of Bengal directed that the Act shall apply to the District of Darjeeling which was an ""excluded area"".
Section 1 (3) of the Essential Supplies Act provided that it shall cease to have effect on the expiration of the period mentioned in section 4 of the India (Central Government and Legislature) Act, 1946.
By a noti fication issued by the Governor General under section 4 the operation of the Essential Supplies Act was extended up to 31st March, 1948.
The Constituent Assembly in which the powers of the Houses of Parliament under section 4 of the above said India Act of 1946 became vested after the passing of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, passed resolutions ex tending the operation of the Essential Supplies Act up to 31st March, 1950.
The appellant, who was convicted under section 7 of the Act in respect of an act committed on the 14th October, 1949, within Darjeeling, contended that the Act was not validly extended to the District of Darjeeling and was not therefore in force there on the date of the alleged offence.
Held, that, as the Governor 's notification extend ed the Act to the District of Darjeeling without specifying any particular period for its applicability, the Act would remain in force in this district as long as it remained in force in the rest of India and a fresh notification of the Governor under section 92 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, was not necessary.
Under the adaptations made under sections 9 and 19 of the Indian Independence Act the powers conferred on the Houses of Parliament became vested in the Constituent Assembly and the Act was in force in the dis trict of Darjeeling on the date of the alleged contravention of the Act.
Held further, that there was no question of delegation of legislative power in this case as the Legislature had itself applied its mind and fixed the duration of the Act, leaving only the machinery to reach the maximum period to be worked out in a particular manner.

Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated 18th August, '1950, of the High Court of Judicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur (Nawal Kishore C.J. and Dave J.) in Criminal Reference No. 229 of Sambat 2005.
H. J. Umrigar for the appellant.
G. C. Mathur for the respondent.
111 1951.
September 24.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Bose J.
The appellant was convicted under section 7 of the Jaipur Opium Act and fined Rs. 50.
The case as such is trivial but the High Court of Rajasthan in Jaipur granted special leave to appeal as an important point touching the vires of the Act arises.
We will state the facts chronolog ically.
It is conceded that the Rulers of Jaipur had full powers of government including those of legislation.
On the 7th of September, 1922, the late Maharaja died and at the time of his death his successor, the present Maharaja, was a minor.
Accordingly, the Crown Representative appointed a Council of Ministers to look after the government and administration of the State during the Maharaja 's minority On the 11th of December, 1923, this Council passed a Resolution which purported to enact the Jaipur Opium Act, and the only question is whether the mere passing of the Resolution without promulgation or publication in the Ga zette, or other means to make the Act known to the public, was sufficient to make it law.
We are of opinion that it was not.
But before giving our reasons for so holding, we will refer to some further facts.
About the same time (that is to say, in the year 1923 we have not been given the exact date) the same Council enacted the Jaipur Laws Act, 1923.
Section 3(b) of this Act provided as follows : ""3.
Subject to the prerogative of the Ruler the law to be administered by the Court of Jaipur State shall be as follows: (b) All the regulations now in force within the said territories, and the enactments and regulations that may hereafter be passed from time to time by the State and published in the Official Gazette.
"" This law came into force on the 1st of November, 1924.
It is admitted that the Jaipur Opium Act was never published in the Gazette either before or after the 1st of November, 1924.
But it is contended that was 112 not necessary because it was a ""regulation"" already in force on that date.
The only other fact of consequence is that on the 19th of May, 1938, section 1 of the Jaipur Opium Act was amended by the addition of sub section (c) which ran as follows: ""(c) It shall come into force from the 1st of September, 1924.
"" The offence for which the appellant was convicted took place on the 8th of October, 1948.
Dealing first with the last of these Acts, namely the one of the 19th of May, 1938, we can put that on one side at once because, unless the Opium Act was valid when made, the mere addition of a clause fourteen years later stating that it shall come into force at a date fourteen years earlier would be useless.
In the year 1938 there was a law which required all enactments after the 1st of November, 1924, to be published in the Gazette.
Therefore, if the Opium Act was not a valid Act at that date, it could not be validated by the publication of only one section of it in the Gazette fourteen years later.
The Jaipur Laws Act of 1923 required the whole of the enactment to be published; therefore publi cation of only one section would not validate it if it was not already valid.
We need not consider whether a law could be made retroactive so as to take effect from 1924 by publi cation in 1938, though that point was argued.
That throws us back to the position in 1923 and raises the question whether a law could be brought into operation by a mere resolution of the Jaipur Council.
We do not know what laws were operative in Jaipur re garding the coming into force of an enactment in that State.
We were not shown any, nor was our attention drawn to any custom which could be said to govern the matter.
In the absence of any special law or custom, we are of opinion that it would be against the principles of natural justice to permit the subjects of a State to be punished or penalised by laws of which they had no knowledge and of which they could not even with the exercise of reasonable diligence have acquired any knowledge.
Natural justice requires that 113 before a law can become operative it must be promulgated or published.
It must be broadcast in some recognisable way so that all men may know what it is; or, at the very least, there must be some special rule or regulation or customary channel by or through which such knowledge can be acquired with the exercise of due and reasonable diligence.
The thought that a decision reached in the secret recesses of a chamber to which the public have no access and to which even their accredited representatives have no access and of which they can normally know nothing, can nevertheless affect their lives, liberty and property by the mere passing of a Resolution without anything more is abhorrent to civilised man.
It shocks his conscience.
In the absence therefore of any law, rule, regulation or custom, we hold that a law cannot come into being in this way.
Promulgation or publica tion of some reasonable sort is essential.
In England the rule is that Acts of Parliament become law from the first moment of the day on which they receive the Royal assent, but Royal Proclamations only when actually published in the official Gazette.
See footnote (a) to paragraph 776.
page 601, of Halsbury 's Laws of England (Hailsham edition), Volume VI and 32 Halsbury 's Laws of England (Hailsham edition), page 150 note (r).
But even there it was necessary to enact a special Act of Parliament to enable such proclamations to become law by publication in the Gazette though a Royal Proclamation is the highest kind of law, other than an Act of Parliament, known to the Brit ish Constitution; and even the publication in the London Gazette will not make the proclamation valid in Scotland nor will publication in the Edinburgh Gazette make it valid for England.
It is clear therefore that the mere enacting or signing of a Royal Proclamation is not enough.
There must be publication before it can become law, and in England the nature of the publication has to be prescribed by an Act of Parliament.
The Act of Parliament regulating this matter is the Crown Office Act of 1877 ' (40 and 41 Victoria Ch. 41).
That Act, in addition to making provision for publication in certain official Gazettes, also provides for the 114 making of rules by Order in Council for the best means of making Proclamations known to the public.
The British Par liament has therefore insisted in the Crown Office Act that not only must there be publication in the Gazette but in addition there must be other modes of publication,if an Order in Council so directs, so that the people at large may know what these special laws are.
The Crown Office Act directs His Majesty in Council carefully to consider the best mode of making these laws known to the public and empowers that body to draw up rules for the same and embody them in an Order in Council.
We take it that if these Proc lamations are not published strictly in accordance with the rules so drawn up, they will not be valid law.
The principle underlying this question has been judi cially considered in England.
For example, on a somewhat lower plane, it was held in Johnson vs Sargant (1) that an Order of the Food Controller under the Beans, Peas and Pulse (Requisition) Order, 1917 does not become operative until it is made known to the public, and the difference between an Order of that kind and an Act of the British Parliament is Stressed.
The difference is obvious.
Acts of the British Parliament are publicly enacted.
The debates are open to the public and the Acts are passed by the accredited representa tives of the people who in theory can be trusted to see that their constituents know what has been done.
They also re ceive wide publicity in papers and, now, over the wireless.
Not so Royal Proclamations and Orders of a Food Controller and so forth.
There must therefore be promulgation and publication in their cases.
The mode of publication can vary; what is a good method in one country may not neces sarily be the best in another.
But reasonable publication of some sort there must be.
Nor is the principle peculiar to England.
It was ap plied to France by the Code Napoleon, the first Article of which states that the laws are executory ""by virtue of the promulgation thereof"" and that they shall come into effect ""from the moment at which their (1) ; 115 promulgation can have been known."" So also it has been applied in India in, for instance, matters arising under Rule 119 of the Defence of India Rules.
See, for example, Crown vs Manghumal Tekuml(1), Shakoor vs King Emperor (2) and Babulal vs King Emperor (3).
It is true none of these cases is analogous to the one before us but they are only particular applications of a deeper rule which is rounded on natural justice.
The Council of Ministers which passed the Jaipur Opium Act was not a sovereign body nor did it function of its own right.
It was brought into being by the Crown Representa tive, and the Jaipur Gazette Notification dated the 11th August, 1923, defined and limited its powers.
We are enti tled therefore to import into this matter consideration of the principles and notions of natural justice which underlie the British Constitution, for it is inconceivable that a representative of His Britannic Majesty could have contem plated the creation of a body which could wield powers so abhorrent to the fundamental principles of natural justice which all freedom loving peoples share.
We hold that, in the absence of some specific law or custom to the contrary, a mere resolution of a Council of Ministers in the Jaipur State without further publication or promulgation would not be sufficient to make a law operative.
It is necessary to consider another point.
It was urged that section 3(b) of the Jaipur Laws Act of 1923 saved all regulations then in force from the necessity of publication in the Gazette.
That may be so, but the Act only saved laws which were valid at the time and not resolutions which had never acquired the force of law.
The appeal succeeds.
The conviction and sentence are set aside.
The fine, if paid, will be refunded.
Appeal allowed.

The Council of Ministers appointed by the Crown Repre sentative for the government and administration of the Jaipur State passed a Resolution in 1923 purporting to enact a law called the Jaipur Opium Act, but this law was neither promulgated or published in the Gazette nor made known to the public.
The Jaipur Laws Act, 1923, which was also passed by the Council and which came into force on the 1st November, 1924, provided by section 3 (b) that the law to be administered by the court of the Jaipur State shall be. "" (b) all the regulations now in force within the said terri tories and the enactments and regulations that may hereafter be passed from time to.

Appeal No. 45.
October 4.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KANIA C.J.
These are five companion appeals from the judgments of the High Court of East Punjab and the principal point argued before us is as to the legality of the deten tion of the appellants under the Preventive Detention Act on the ground that they are engaged in black marketing in cotton piecegoods.
The Jullundur Wholesale Cloth Syndicate was formed to work out the distribution of cloth under the Government of Punjab Control (Cloth) Order passed under the Essential Supplies Act.
Certain persons who held licences as whole sale dealers in cloth formed themselves into a corporation and all cloth controlled by the Government was distributed in the district to the retail quota holders through them.
The Government allotted quotas to the retailers and orders were issued by the Government for giving each retailer certain bales under the distribution control.
If some of the retail licence holders did not take delivery of the quotas allotted to them under the Notification of the 4th of October, 1950, issued by the Government of India, Department of Industries and Supplies, it was, inter alia, provided that the wholesale syndicate may give the bales not so lifted to another retail dealer.
It may be noted that all along the price for the cloth to be sold wholesale and retail had been fixed under Government orders.
The Syndi cate was suspected to be dealing in black market and had been warned against its activities by the District Magis trate of Jullundur several times.
On the 7th of June, 1951, 21 an order was issued by the District Organiser, Civil Sup plies and Rationing, Jullundur, to the managing agents of the wholesale cloth corporation, Jullundur City, intimating that they were strictly forbidden to dispose of any uplifted stock against unexpired terms without his prior permission in writing.
They were further directed that thenceforth no such stock would be allowed to be sold to an individual retailer, but permission would be granted to sell the same to associations of retailers only.
It was stated that this letter was not in accordance with clause 5 of the Notifica tion of the Government of India dated the 4th October, 1950, which authorized the wholesale syndicate to be at liberty to sell uplifted cloth to any other retailer or an association of retail dealers of the same district.
It may be further noted that the Cotton Cloth Control Order was in operation even prior to 1950.
For some time control on the distribu tion of cloth was lifted but the price remained under the control of the Government.
During that time it has been alleged that the appellants and several others sold cloth at rates higher than those fixed by the Government.
Even when the distribution and price were both controlled, the manu facturing mills were allowed to sell at prices fixed by the Government a certain percentage of cloth which was not taken by the Government under its control.
This was described as free sale cloth and it was alleged that the appellants and several others were doing black marketing in this free sale cloth.
By an order passed by the District Magistrate on 19th June, 1951, he directed that the appellants be detained under section 3 (2) of the Preventive Detention Act to prevent them from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies of cloth, essential to the communi ty.
On the 2nd July, 1951, the District Magistrate, Jullun dur, directed that the appellants be committed to District Jail, Jullundur, from the 2nd July until the 1st October, 1951.
The appellants were detained accordingly.
The grounds for their detention were given to them on the morn ing of the 6th July.
The grounds set out the activities of 22 the appellants as managing agents or partners in different firms or employees of the said firms or corporations.
It was stated ,that they had been disposing of most of the stocks of cloth received for the Jullundur District in the black market at exhorbitant rates from June, 1949, to Octo ber, 1950, during the period when control on distribution was removed and that even after the reimposition of that control in October, 1950, they disposed of cloth which has been frozen under the directions of Director of Civil Sup plies in the short interval between the passing of the order and its service on them.
The second ground was in respect of their individual activities as members of the firm in which they were partners in disposing of stocks of cloth in black market at rates higher than the controlled ones, to various dealers, through agents.
The particulars were speci fied in Appendix 'A '.
They refer to the free sale cloth.
In the third ground it was alleged that ' by illegal means they deprived the rightful claimants of the various stocks of cloth with a view to pass the same into black market at exorbitant rates.
We do not think it necessary to go into greater details of these grounds or refer to the other grounds.
On the 9th of July, 1951, petitions under article 226 of the Constitution of India were filed in the East Punjab High Court asking for writs of habeas corpus against the State on the ground that the detention of the appellants under the Preventive Detention Act was illegal.
The District Magis trate filed his affidavit in reply challenging the allega tion of mala fides and setting out in some detail instances of the activities of the appellants and contended that on the reports received by him he was satisfied that the deten tion of the appellants was necessary.
Early in August, 1951, the executive authorities cancelled the licence of the appellants as cloth dealers.
The High Court dismissed the petitions and the petitioners have come on appeal to us.
Section 3 of the , pro vides that the Central Government or the State Government may, if satisfied with respect to any person that 23 with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community it is necessary so to do, make an order directing that such person be detained.
The power to act in accordance with the terms of this provision was given by section 3 (2) to a District Magistrate.
Such Magistrate however was required to make a report to the State Govern ment to which he was subordinate about the order and also to send the grounds on which the order had been made and such other particulars as, in his opinion, had a bearing on the necessity of the order.
It is not disputed that an order under section 3 (2) of the to prevent black marketing can be passed by the District Magistrate.
On behalf of the appellants it is contended that in the grounds for their detention reference is made to their activities prior to June, 1951, only.
This cannot be considered objectionable because having regard to those activities it is alleged that the satisfaction required under the section had arisen.
It was next argued that such loophole as existed in the total control of distribution and ' sale and price of piecegoods in the district was sealed by the order of the District Orga niser dated the 7th June, 1951.
By virtue of that order the syndicate or corporation could not sell any cloth without an express order in writing from the District Organiser, and therefore there could be no black marketing after that date by any of the appellants and the order was therefore unjus tified.
It was next contended that in any event now as their licences are cancelled they cannot deal in cloth and the order of detention now maintained against them is more in the nature of punishment than prevention.
It was argued that orders under the were for the purpose of preventing a person from acting in future in the objectionable way contemplated by the Act and it was beyond the scope of the Act to pass orders in respect of their alleged activities anterior to June, 1951.
In our opinion the High Court approached the matter quite correctly.
Instances of past activities are relevant 24 to be considered in giving rise to the subjective mental conviction of the District Magistrate that the appellants were likely to indulge in objectionable activities.
The grounds which were given for the detention are relevant and the question whether they are sufficient or not is not for the decision of the Court.
The Legislature has made only the subjective satisfaction of the authority making the order essential for passing the order.
The contention that because in the Amending Act of 1951 an Advisory Board is constitut ed, which can supervise and override the decision taken by the executive authority, and therefore the question whether the grounds are sufficient to give rise to the satisfaction has become a justifiable issue in Court, is clearly unsound.
The satisfaction for making the initial order is and has always been under the , that of the authority making the order.
Because the Amending Act of 1951 establishes a supervisory authority, that discretion and subjective test is not taken away and by the establish ment of the Advisory Board, in our opinion, the Court is not given the jurisdiction to decide whether the subjective decision of the authority making the order was right or not.
Proceeding on the footing, therefore, that the jurisdiction to decide whether the appellants should be detained under the on the grounds conveyed to the appellants is of the District Magistrate.
In the present cases, two arguments were advanced on behalf of the appel lants.
It was strenuously urged that by reason of the order of the District Organiser of the 7th June, 1951, the only loophole which remained in the scheme of distribution and sale of cloth under control of the Government was sealed and it was impossible after that order to do any blackmarketing by any of the appellants.
We are unable to accept this contention.
In the first place, this order appears to be an administrative order and is in the nature of a warning.
It is at variance with the provisions of clause 5 of the Order of the Central Government of the 4th October, 1950.
Moreover this order does not bring about the result claimed for it.
A lot 25 of cloth which the manufacturers are permitted to distribute through persons outside the Government agencies can still be secured and sold at exhorbitant rates, i.e., at rates higher than those fixed by the Government.
The second argument was that as the licences of the appellants are now cancelled they cannot deal in textile cloth at all and therefore there can be no apprehension of their indulging in black market activities.
We are unable to accept this argument also because it is common knowledge that licences can be obtained in the name of nominees.
Again while these people may not have their licences in Jullundur District they may have or may obtain licences in other districts.
From the fact that their licences have been cancelled a month after the order of detention was passed we are unable to hold that it is impossible on that ground for the appellants to indulge in black market activities.
In this connection an extract from the further affidavit of the District Magistrate of Jullun dur dated 1st August, 1951, may be usefully noticed.
He stated: ""There have been orders for the release of certain stocks of cloth in respect of other mills, as free sale cloth after the 9th June, 1951.
Any quantity of cloth not paid for and lifted by the owners ' nominees will revert to the Mills for free sale: vide letter No. CYC 2/ SLM, dated the 31st May, 1951, from the Textile Commissioner, Bombay, to all selected Mills in Bombay and Ahmedabad.
This cloth can be purchased by any wholesale dealer of cloth of India, without any restriction.
Not only this, free sale cloth can be transported from one district to another without a per mit: vide Memo No. 28894 CS (C) 50/48791, dated 2nd January, 1951, from the Joint Director, Civil Supplies, and Under Secretary to Government Punjab to the District Organiser, Civil Supplies and Rationing, Ludhiana.
Again free sale cloth is also procurable from individual firms who conspired to make profit by black marketing.
The only information which is supplied by a purchaser of wholesale cloth to the District Magistrate is as to what quantity of such cloth has been imported 4 26 into the district.
According to the report of the District Organiser no such cloth was imported into Jullundur by the corporation but there are reasons to believe that the Corpo ration had been making their purchases in free sale cloth from the Mills and using those bales to make up the defi ciency in the bales of quota cloth of superior quality which they used to dispose of in the black market in collusion with the Mills.
Besides, the firm Rattan Chand Mathra Dass, as would be evident from the attached lists signed by the District Organiser, had been dealing in free sale cloth and had also been importing cloth as Reserve of Kangra and also Provincial Reserve.
Most of this quota also found its way into the black market.
Similarly the firm Madan Gopal Nand Lall and Company had been dealing in free sale cloth on a large scale.
It would be evident from the attached list.
Santi Sarup, the Secretary of the Corporation, is believed to be a partner in the firm Hari Chand Bindra Ban and this firm also had been dealing in free sale cloth.
The free sale cloth acquired by them used to be invariably sold in the black market as reported by the District Organiser in his Memo No. 6306/6734 M/CT/Do.
7 dated 1st August, 1950, in reply to my Memo.
No. nil dated 30th July, 1951.
There is absolutely no bar for the wholesale cloth corporation, Jullundur, to its getting free sale cloth from the Mills or other wholesale dealers nor is there any bar for the firms Rattan Chand Mathra Dass and Madan Gopal Nand Lal and Co. to the acquiring of free sale cloth.
"" It was next argued on behalf of the appellants that the only order of detention made against them was the order of the 2nd July and that did not refer to any section of the and did not suggest that there was any satisfaction of the detaining authority.
It was argued that no order of the 19th of June was ever shown to any of the appellants or served on them and therefore their deten tion was illegal.
It should be pointed out that these con tentionsare raised in the affidavits not of the detained persons, but of their relations.
Their affidavits do not show that they have any personal knowledge.
The affidavits 27 on this point are based only on their belief and information and the source of the information is not even disclosed.
As against this, there is the affidavit of the District Magis trate which expressly states that the terms of the Order of the 19th of June were fully explained to each of the dete nus.
The petitions for the writs of habeas corpus were filed within a week after the service of the detention order and we do not think there is any reason to doubt the cor rectness of the statements of the District Magistrate.
In our opinion this ground of attack on the order of detention has no substance and the detention cannot be held illegal on that ground.
The judgment of the High Court was attacked on these grounds and as we are unable to accept any of these contentions the appeals must fail.
One of the appellants is the secretary of one corpora tion and another is a salesman and clerk in one of the firms.
On their behalf it was urged that they could not indulge in black market activities.
We are unable to accept this contention in view of what is stated in the affidavits of the District Magistrate.
It is there pointed out that in addition to being a secretary or a clerk and in those capac ities actively participating in the black market activities of their principals, they were themselves indulging in black market activities in cloth.
If these and other facts in respect of the appellants are disputed the matter will be considered by the Advisory Board.
The question of the truth of those statements however is not within the jurisdiction of this Court to decide.
As all the grounds urged against the judgment of the High Court fail, all the five appeals are dismissed.
Appeals dismissed.
Agent for the appellants in all the appeals: R.S. Naru la.
Agent for the respondent and Intervener: P.A. Mehta.
","An order of detention to prevent black marketing cannot be held to be illegal merely because in the grounds for such detention the detaining authority has referred only to the past activities of the person detained, inasmuch as in stances of past activities may give rise to a subjective mental conviction that it is necessary to detain such person to prevent him from indulging in black marketing in the future.
Under the Preventive Detention.
Act, 1950, the test as to whether an order of detention should be made is the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority; the Court has no power to consider whether the grounds supplied by the authority are sufficient to give rise to such satis faction.
The establishment of the Advisory Board by the Amending Act of 1951 has not made the matter a justiciable one, and even after the Amending Act the Court has no power to consider whether the grounds supplied ' are sufficient for making an order of detention.

The Judgment of Kania CJ.
, Das and Bose JJ. was read by Das J. Patanjali Sastri and Chandrasekhara Aiyar JJ.
delivered separate Judgments.
45 DAS J.
This is an appeal from the judgment of a Bench of the Bombay High Court (Sen and Dixit JJ.) delivered on February 2, 1947, in an appeal filed under section 18 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act 11 of 1876 against the judgment of the Revenue Judge at Bombay delivered on October 27, 1942, in a suit filed by the respondents, the Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay, and Madusudan Damodar Bhat, the then Municipal Commissioner for the City of Bom bay, against the Collector of Bombay.
There is no substantial dispute as to the facts leading up to this litigation and they may be shortly stated.
In 1865, the Government of Bombay, having decided to construct an Eastern Boulevard, called upon the Corporation of Jus tices of the Peace for the City of Bombay, the predecessor in title of the respondent Corporation, to remove its then existing fish and vegetable markets from the site required for the construction of the Boulevard.
The then Municipal Commissioner Mr. Arthur Crawford, after whom the present municipal market was named, applied for the site set aside for the exhibition buildings on the Esplanades for the pur pose of constructing new markets as the existing markets could not be removed until new markets had been provided.
On December 5, 1865, the Architectural Improvement Committee informed the Government that it had no objection to the proposed she measuring about 7 acres being ""rented to the Municipal Commissioner"" and suggested that ""the annual charge of one pie per square yard be levied in consideration of the expense of filling in the ground.
"" Computed at this rate, the annual rental would have amounted to about Rs. 176.
On December 19, 1865, the Government passed the fol lowing resolution : ""(1) Government approve of the site and authorise its grant.
(2) The plans should be submitted for approval; but Government do not consider any rent should be charged to the Municipality as the markets will be, like other public buildings, for the benefit of the whole community.
"" 46 Pursuant to the aforesaid Resolution, possession of the site was made over to the then Municipal Commis sioner, but no formal grant was executed as required by Statute 22 & 23 Vic. C. 41.
It has nowhere been contended that even if the statutory formalities had been complied with the grant upon the terms mentioned in the Resolution would nevertheless have been invalid being in excess of the powers of the Government.
The Municipal Com missioner had the site filled up and leveled at the expense of the Corporation.
The plans were approved by the Govern ment and the market buildings were erected by the Corpora tion at considerable expense.
The respondent Corporation was incorporated in 1888 as the successor of the Corporation of the Justices of the Peace for the City of Bombay and it continued in possession of the land and the buildings with out paying any rent to the Government according to the Government Resolution of 1865.
Indeed, it is pleaded in paragraph 7 of the plaint and it is not denied in the writ ten statement that acting upon the said grant contained in the Resolution and the terms contained therein the respond ent Corporation and its predecessor spent considerable sums of money in building and improving the market and have been in possession of the land and the buildings thereon for over 70 years in accordance with the terms of the Resolution and that no land revenue or rent had been paid to the Government ever since the grant was made.
It is in evidence that besides giving up the sites on which the old markets had been situate, a total sum of Rs. 17,65,980 12 1 has been spent by the Corporation up to March 31,1940, in filling up and leveling the site and erecting and maintaining the new market buildings on this site.
In 1911, a portion of the market site was acquired by the Government for the widening of the Palton Road.
Upon the Collector of Bombay being called upon to put in ,his claim, if any, to any part of the compensation money awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer, the Superintendent,, City Survey, on behalf of the Collec tor, replied that Government had no claim in respect of the said land.
The respondent 47 Corporation, therefore, received the whole of the compen sation money and it continued in possession of the rest of the land and the buildings thereon without payment of any rent.
On March 18, 1938, the appellant Collector of Bombay informed the respondent Municipal Commissioner that it was proposed to assess the land occupied by the Crawford Market under section 8 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act II of 1876 and asked for certain information to enable him to do so.
In his reply, the Municipal Commissioner wrote to say that the site of the market had been given to the Municipal ity as a gift for the construction of the market and that, therefore the question of assessment did not arise.
The appellant Collector of Bombay having insisted that in spite of the Government Resolution of 1865 the Government had the right to assess the site, the Mayor of Bombay on March 23, 1939, wrote a letter to the Government stating, inter alia, as follows : ""The Corporation have been advised that there can be no doubt that it was the intention of Government to make a permanent grant of the land to the Municipality, and, fur ther, that it was also the intention that permanent grant should be free from rent and from assessment to land revenue.
I am to point out that the word 'rent ' was used in official documents with the greatest frequency with refer ence to the land revenue leviable by the East India Company and later by Government in the City of Bombay and in the Presidency.
It is, therefore, clear that it was the inten tion of Government in 1865 that this grant should be free from any form of rent or assessment.
The Corporation were put into possession for a period of over 70 years, during which period the land has without interruption been devoted to the purpose for which the grant was made.
Throughout this long period there has been no suggestion from Govern ment that the grant was other than a permanent one, free of revenue, or that the terms of the grant were in any way subject to revision,"" 48 The above contentions were repudiated by the Govern ment in its letter of January 1, 1940, in the following terms: "" As regards the contention that the land has been held by the Municipality uninterruptedly for over 70 years with out any suggestion from Government that it was liable to assessment, I am to state the right to levy the assessment is the prerogative of the Crown and a mere non user of this prerogative cannot destroy it.
Besides, conditions have considerably altered since the land was originally allotted to the Municipality without charging any ground rent or assessment; the Municipality has been recovering substantial rents by letting out stalls in the market and should now be in a position to pay the assessment.
Under the circum stances, the levy of assessment in this case can no longer be foregone or postponed.
"" On January 31, 1940, the appellant Collector assessed the land under section 8 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 with a guarantee of 50 years as under : ""Assessment Rs. 7,500 per annum for the first 10 years from 1st April, 1940.
Assessment Rs. 15,000 per annum for the next 10 years.
Assessment Rs. 30,000 per annum for the remaining 30 years.
"" The assessment was to begin to run from I st April, 1940, and the first payment of the assessment was to become due on 1st April, 1941.
The present suit was thereupon filed in the Court of the Revenue Judge in accordance with the provisions of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act, 1876, for the following reliefs, inter alia : ""(a) that it may be declared that there is a right on the part of the plaintiff Corporation in limitation of the right of Government to assess the said land and that the plaintiff Corporation is entitled to hold the said land for ever without payment of any assessment and that the Govern ment has no right to assess the said premises, 49 (b) That the said assessment may be declared ultra vires, invalid and may be ordered to be set aside.
"" By his judgment dated October 27, 1942, the learned Revenue Judge dismissed the suit with costs.
The Corporation appealed to the High Court.
Before the High Court, as before us, two of the learned Revenue Judge 's conclusions were not challenged namely, (1) that the Government Resolu tion of 1865 was bad in law either as a grant or even as a contract and could not by itself operate to give any inter est in the land to the respondent Corporation because of the non compliance with the formalities required to be observed by Statute 22 & 23 Vic. C. 41 in the matter of disposition of all real and personal estate vested in the Crown under Statute 21 & 22 Vic. C. 106, and (2) that the Crown 's right to levy assessment on property was a prerogative right to which the ordinary presumption that rights to property which had not been asserted or exercised for a long period of years had been granted away did not apply What was urged before and accepted by the High Court was that the right of the Government to levy any assessment on the land in ques tion had been lost and could not be asserted or exercised by the Government by reason of the equity arising on the facts and circumstances of the case in favour of the respondent Corporation on the principle established by the decision in Ramsden vs Dyson(1) which was adopted by Jenkins C.J. in The Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay vs The Secretary of State(2) and which equity was, on the authorities, bind ing on the Crown.
After dealing with the cases of Dadoba Janardhan vs The Collector of Bombay(3) and Jethabhoy Rut tonsey vs The Collector of Bombay(4) the High Court observed : ""We think, on a reading of the language of the Govern ment Resolution dated the 19th December, 1865, that we should be justified in holding (within the meaning of the rule in Ramsden vs Dyson) that an expectation was created or encouraged by the landlord that the Municipality was to get possession of the land rent free and that the latter took possession of the land with the consent of the landlord, and upon such expectation, with the knowledge of the landlord and without objection by him, laid out money upon the land.""
According to the High Court the rule of equity enunciated in Ramsden vs Dyson (supra) was not, as pointed out by Jenkins C.J. in Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay vs The Secretary of State (supra), dependent on the validity of the disposition and could be asserted even where the statutory formalities relating to the disposition of the property had not been observed and performed, and that this equity constituted a right on the part of the respondent Corporation in limitation of the right of the Government in consequence of a specific limit to assessment having been established and preserved within the meaning of section 8 of the Act II of 1876 so as to disentitle the Government from assessing the land in question.
The High Court relied on the decision in Kamalavahooji Maharaj vs The Collector of Bombay(1) in support of their view that section 8 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 would apply even where the specific limit was nil.
In the result, the High Court reversed the decision of the learned Revenue Judge, allowed the appeal and passed a decree declaring the rights of the respondent Corporation and awarding to it the costs in both Courts.
The Collector of Bombay appealed to the Federal Court and the appeal has now come up for hearing before us.
There has been considerable discussion before us as to the precise scope and effect of the principle of equity enunciated in Ramsden vs Dyson (supra), as to whether such principle should be extended to the facts of the present case, whether the facts 'of this case attract the applica tion of the equity established in Ramsden vs Dyson (supra)or attract the equity established in Maddison vs Alderson (2) and Walsh vs Lonsdale(3) and finally as to whether, in view of the decision (1) (3) (2) 51 of the Privy Council in Ariff vs Jadunath(1), the equity in Ramsden vs Dyson (supra) can prevail against the requirement of formalities laid down in the Victorian Statute referred to above any more than the equity in Maddison vs Alderson (supra)can do against the requirements of the Transfer of Property Act and whether the decision in The Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay vs The Secretary of State(2) requires reconsideration in the light of the deci sion in Ariff 's case (supra).
In the view we have taken, it is not necessary to go into, and to express any opinion on, any of these questions, for this appeal can, in our opinion, be disposed of on a narrower and shorter ground.
The Government claims to assess the lands in terms of section 8 of the Bombay Act II of 1876 which runs thus : ""8.It shall be the duty of the Collector, subject to the orders of the Provincial Government, to fix and to levy the assessment for land revenue.
Where there is no right on the part of the superior holder in limitation of the right of the Provincial Govern ment to assess, the assessment shall be fixed at the discre tion of the Collector subject to the control of the Provin cial Government.
When there is a right on the part of the superior holder in limitation of the right of the Provincial Government, in consequence of a specific limit to assessment having been established and preserved, the assessment shall not exceed such specific limit.
"" The sole question for our consideration is whether, on the facts of this case, the respondent Corporation has succeeded in establishing in itself a right in limitation of the right of the Government to assess the land in conse quence of a specific limit to assessment having been estab lished and preserved.
There is no dispute that by reason of the non compliance with the statutory formalities the Gov ernment Resolution of 1865 is not an effectual grant passing title in the land to the respondent Corporation and is not also an enforceable contract.
On the other hand, there is no doubt as to the existence of an intention on the part of the Government to make and on the part of the Corporation to take a grant of the land in terms of the Resolution of 1865 including an undertaking by the Government not to charge any rent.
Both parties acted on the basis of that Resolution and the prede cessor in title of the respondent Corporation went into possession of the land in question pursuant to the Govern ment Resolution of 1865 and, acting upon the said Resolution and the terms contained therein, the respondent Corporation and its predecessor in title spent considerable sums of money in leveling the site and erecting and maintaining the market buildings and have been in possession of the land for over 70 years.
What, in the circumstances was the legal position of the respondent Corporation and its predecessor in title in relation to the land in question?
They were in possession of the land to which they had no legal title at all.
Therefore, the position of the respondent Corporation and its predecessor in title was that of a person having no legal title but nevertheless holding possession of the land under color of an invalid grant of the land in perpetuity and free from rent for the purpose of a market.
Such pos session not being referable to any legal title it was prima facie adverse to the legal title of the Government as owner of the land from the very moment the predecessor in title of the respondent Corporation took possession of the land under the invalid grant.
This possession has continued openly, as of right and uninterruptedly for over 70 years and the respondent Corporation has acquired the limited title it and its predecessor in title had been prescribing for during all this period, that is to say, the right to hold the land in perpetuity free from rent but only for the purposes of a market in terms of the Government Resolution of 1865.
The immunity from the liability to pay rent is just as much an integral part or an inseverable incident of the title so acquired as is the obligation to hold the land for the purposes of a market and for no other purpose.
There is no question 53 of acquisition by adverse possession of the Government 's prerogative right to levy assessment.
What the respondent Corporation has acquired is the legal right to hold the land in perpetuity free of rent for the specific purpose of erecting and maintaining a market upon the terms of the Government Resolution as if a legal grant had been made to it.
The right thus acquired includes, as part of it, an immunity from payment of rent which must necessarily consti tute a right in limitation of the Government 's right to assess in excess of the specific limit established and preserved by the Government Resolution within the meaning of section 8 of the Bombay Act II of 1876.
It is true, as pointed out by the Privy Council in Karnalavahooji Maharaj vs Collector of Bombay (supra) that the words of the section would appear to apply rather to the case of a limitation on the right to assess than to the case of a complete exemption from assessment but such a construction would not protect the cases of total exemption which, as conceded in that very case, did in fact exist and were recognised and protected by virtue of the words of section 8 of the Bombay Act II of 1876.
It has not been suggested before us that there are no cases of total exemption or that those cases are protected by any provision of law other than that of this very section.
There is, therefore, no escape from the conclusion arrived at by the High Court, with which we concur, that the words of section 8 would apply to a case where total exemp tion from assessment was granted.
In other words, specific limit may be nil for the purposes of section 8 of the Act.
It was sought to be argued that even if the Government be precluded from enhancing the ""rent"" in view of the terms of the Government Resolution, it cannot be held to have disentitled itself from its prerogative right to assess ""land revenue"".
This contention is sought to be rounded on a distinction between ""rent"" and"" land revenue"".
This contention, however, was not raised in the written statement and was not made the subjectmatter of any issue on which the parties went to trial and was never put forward before either of the Courts 54 below.
Indeed, in the letter of the Mayor of Bombay dated March 22, 1939, to which reference has been made, it was clearly alleged that the word ""rent"" was used in official documents with the greatest frequency with reference to the land revenue leviable by the East India Company and later by the Government in the City of Bombay and in the Presidency.
"" In the Government 's reply dated January 24, 1940, also quoted above this assertion was never repudiated or denied.
In the premises, the appellant cannot be permit ted at this stage to raise this contention rounded on the supposed distinction, if any, between ""rent"" and ""land revenue"" and for the purpose of this case we must proceed on the basis that the word ""rent"" in the Government Resolution of 1865 was synonymous with or included"" land revenue.
"" In our opinion, for reasons stated above, the actual decision of the High Court was correct and this appeal should be dismissed with costs, and we order accordingly.
PATANJALI SASTRI j. I am of opinion that this appeal should be allowed and I will briefly indicate my reasons without recapitulating the facts which have been fully stated in the judgment of my learned brother Das which I have had the advantage of reading.
The appeal concerns a claim by the Provincial Govern ment of Bombay to charge land revenue on a plot of land on which the predecessors of the respondent Municipality erect ed the buildings known as the Crawford Market in the City of Bombay.
It is common ground that the land in question would be assessable to land revenue under section 8 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act (No. II of 1876) unless the respondent established ""a right in limitation of the right of the Provincial Government in consequence of a specific limit to assessment having been established and preserved"", in which case, the assessment must not exceed such specific limit.
It has been held, and it is not now disputed, that the words quoted above cover 55 a right of total exemption from assessment, the ""specific limit"" in such a case being nil (see Goswamini Shri Kamala vahooji vs Collector of Bombay (1).
The only question, therefore, is whether the respondent has established a right to such exemption.
The resolution of the Government dated 19th December, 1865, authorising the grant of the land without ""any rent being charged to the Municipality as the market will be like other buildings for the benefit of the whole community"" did not by itself purport to pass title to the land in question or to confer on the Municipality a right to exemp tion from land revenue.
Admittedly no formal instrument was executed either granting the land or exempting it from assessment.
Nor could the resolution be regarded as a valid disposition of property or an enforceable contract not to charge revenue on the land, as it did not comply with the requirements of the statute 22& 23 Vic. C. 41 which pre scribed certain formalities to be observed for such transactions.
As pointed out by Jenkins C.J. in Municipal Corpora tion of the City of Bombay vs The Secretary of State (2) all land in British India having been vested in the Crown by 21 & 22 Vic. C. 106, the Governor in Council in Bombay could not dispose of property or enter into a contract on behalf of the Crown except in exercise of the power bestowed on them for the purpose under 22 & 23 Vic. C. 41, and that power could be exercised only by observing the formalities prescribed by that statute.
The learned Judges of the High Court, while recognising this difficulty in the way of the respondent establishing a legal right to exemption from assessment, held that the conduct of the Provincial Govern ment in allowing and, indeed, encouraging the respondent to erect the buildings at great cost on the faith of the prom ise not to charge land revenue contained in the Resolution of 19th December, 1865, precluded the respondent on the equitable principle recognised in Ramsden vs Dyson from assessing the land in question, and that this equity was a ""right"" in limitation of the right of the Provincial Government to assess.
I am unable to share that view.
There is, in my opin ion, no room here for the application of the principle of Ramsden vs Dyson(1).
That decision has been explained by the Privy Council in Ariff vs Jadunath(2) as based on the equitable doctrine of part performance which, their Lord ships held, could not be applied so as to nullify the ex press provisions of the Transfer of Property Act relating to the creation of leases.
They observed : Whether an English equitable doctrine should, in any case, be applied so as to modify the effect of an Indian statute may well be doubted; but that an English equitable doctrine, affecting the provisions of an English statute relating to the right to sue upon a contract, should be applied, by analogy, to such a statute as the Transfer of Property Act and with such a result as to create without any writing an interest which the statute says can only be created by means of a registered instrument, appears to their Lordships, in the absence of some binding authority to that effect, to be impossible.""
After quoting the well known passage in the judgment of Lord Kingsdown, their Lordships commented thus : ""It will be noticed that Lord Kingsdown is dealing with the case of express verbal contract or something 'which amounts to the same thing. '
He nowhere puts the case of estoppel; the word is not mentioned.
He would appear to be dealing simply with the equitable doctrine of part performance.
His reference to Gregory vs Mighall [(1811) 18 Ves.3281 confirms this view, for that case was simply an earlier instance of the application of the doctrine.
Even if Lord Kingsdown 's language was intended to cover something beyond the equitable doctrine of part performance in relation to the Statute of Frauds, and was intended to refer to circum stances in which a court of equity will enforce a title to land against the person who at law is the owner thereof, the title must, nevertheless, in their Lordships ' view, be based either upon contract express or implied, or upon some statement of fact grounding an estoppel.
In the later decision in Mian Pir Bux vs Sardar Ma horned(1) their Lordships reiterated the same view and held that English equitable doctrines did not afford in India a valid defence to an action in ejectment based on title.
After these decisions of the Privy Council elucidating the principles underlying Ramsden vs Dyson(2) and Maddison vs Alderson(3), it seems to me clear that they have no application to the facts of the present case.
They can no more prevail against the statutory provisions regarding the disposition of property or the making of contracts by Gov ernment than against the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act requiring registered instruments for effecting certain classes of transactions.
No question of estoppel by representation arises, for the Government made no represen tation of fact which it now seeks to deny.
Nor can any case of estoppel by acquiescence be rounded on the facts of the case.
Both parties knew the facts and neither was misled.
There was no lying by and letting another run into a trap [per Cotton L.J. in Russell vs Watts(4)].
The conduct of the parties was referable to the express agreement evidenced by the Government Resolution of 19th December, 1865, to make a grant of the land free of rent (which, in such context, means and includes revenue).
No question, therefore, of any implied contract could arise.
Unfortunately for the respond ent, the express agreement was unenforceable owing to non observance of the prescribed statutory formalities, though it was acted upon by both sides.
No question arises here as to the respondent 's title to the land which apparently has been perfected by lapse of time.
But it is clear that no right of exemption has been established either on the basis of express or implied contract or on the basis of the equitable principles of part performance or estoppel by acquiescence.
It was next contended that, on the analogy of the line of cases holding that a limited interest in land could be acquired by adverse possession for over the statutory peri od, the respondent 's possession of the land in dispute without payment of any quit rent or revenue for over 70 years to the knowledge of the Government perfected its title to hold the land free from liability to pay land revenue.
It is difficult to appreciate the argument so far as the claim to exemption is concerned.
There is no question here of acquisition of a limited interest in land by adverse possession.
The respondent was asserting full ownership and a right of exemption from assessment and the Government agreed with that view as shown by their letter dated 26th June, 1921, to the Land Acquisition Officer for the City of Bombay wherein they stated that ""no Government claim in respect of the land under acquisition (a portion of the land here in question) in the above mentioned case is made as the land vests in the Municipality.
"" Be it noted that the Government made no claim even to a portion of the compensa tion on the basis of any right of resumption reserved to them, the Resolution of 1865 having made no such reserva tion.
The position then was that throughout the period of adverse possession, the respondent Municipality regarded itself and was regarded by the Government as absolute owner of the land with the additional right of exemption from assessment to land revenue with the result that the Govern ment 's ""right to such property"" (the subject of adverse possession) was ""extinguished"" under section 28 of the Limitation Act.
But the right to levy land revenue was no part of the Government 's right to the property.
It is a prerogative right of the Crown which was placed ' on a statu tory basis under the Bombay City Land Revenue Act of 1876, and could be exercised in respect of a land only on the footing that it belonged to another, the ""superior holder"", for, the claim to levy assessment itself implies a recogni tion of ownership in 59 another.
It is, therefore, difficult to see how adverse possession of the land could entitle the respondent to exemption from assessment of land revenue.
It was said that the Government having intended to grant the land on the terms that it was to be held free of quit rent or revenue and the respondent having held the land on such terms claiming it to be exempt from assessment, a title to hold it on those terms was perfected by the adverse possession, the covenant for exemption from assessment forming part and parcel of the title.
In other words, the respondent should be placed in the same position as if the Government had made a valid revenue free grant.
The argument is, to my mind, fallacious.
If the Government had given effect to their expressed intention by executing an instru ment in writing observing the due formalities, the respond ent would, no doubt, have secured a valid title to the property with a contract binding the Government not to charge revenue, supported as it was by consideration.
But, as already stated, the Government 's promise not to charge land revenue was unenforceable from the inception, and the respondent 's adverse possession of the land, though accompa nied by a claim to exemption from revenue, could not destroy the Crown 's prerogative right to impose assessment on the land.
A somewhat analogous question arose in Goswamini Shri Kamala Vahooji vs Collector of Bombay(1).
The Government admitted that no land revenue had ever been charged in respect of the land which was enjoyed by the holders for more than a century without payment of revenue and it was urged that in virtue of such a long enjoyment a lost grant of the land on the terms that it should be held free from liability to pay revenue must be presumed.
Rejecting that contention, their Lordships observed : ""The appellant submits that in the circumstances a lost grant should be presumed, and that this lost grant should be presumed to have contained an exemption from land revenue or a 'right in limitation of the right of Government to assess the property.
The law may presume the existence of a grant which has been lost where it is sought to disturb a person in the enjoyment of right which he and his predecessors have immemorially enjoyed, but it is a different thing to seek to presume that the Crown has by some lost grant deprived 'itself of the prerogative power to tax the property of its subjects, and their Lordships are of opinion that this plea is untenable."" (italics mine).
The decision shows that exemption from land revenue does not form part and parcel of the title to land but is collateral to it.
If a presumed lost grant could not cover it neither could title by adverse possession.
I would allow the appeal but make no order as to costs.
I had the advantage of reading the judgment prepared by my learned brother; Mr. Justice Das, and 1 agree in the conclusion he has reached; but i wish to add a few words of my own on some of the points that have been discussed during the course of the hearing.
In the first place, there can be little doubt that the word ""rent"" in paragraph 2 of the Government Resolution of the 19th December 1865, means ""assessment "".
It is true that this word is used generally in cases of landlord and tenant, but when it is remembered that here the Govern ment was parting with the land vested in the Crown in favour of the Municipal Corporation of Bombay, it can safely be assumed or presumed that they were thinking not merely of their rights as landlord but also of their prerogative right as well.
That the land was going to be used for the build i","In 1865, the Government of Bombay called upon the prede cessor in title of the Corporation of Bombay to remove some markets from a certain site and vacate it, and on the appli cation of the then Municipal Commissioner the Government passed a resolution approving and authorising the grant of another site to the Municipality.
The resolution stated further that ""the Government do not consider that any rent should be charged to the Municipality as the markets will be, like other public buildings, for the benefit of the whole community.
"" The Corporation gave up the sites on which the old markets were situated and spent a sum of over 17 lacs in erecting and maintaining markets on the new site.
In 1940 the Collector of Bombay, overruling the objection of the Corporation, assessed the new site under section 8 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act to land revenue rising from Rs. 7,500 to Rs. 30,000 in 50 years.
The Corporation sued for a declaration that the order of assessment was ultra vires and that it was entitled to hold the land for ever without payment of any assessment.
The High Court of Bombay held applying the principle of Ramsden vs Dyson(1) that the Government had lost its right to assess the land in question by reason of the equity arising on the facts of the case in favour of the Corporation and there was thus a limitation on the right of the Government to assess under section 8 of the said Act: Held per KANIA C.J., DAS, CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR and BOsE JJ.
(PATANJALI SASTRI J. dissenting) that the Govern ment was not, under the circumstances of the case, entitled to assess land revenue on the land in question.
Per KANIA C.J., DAS and Bose JJ.
Though there was no effectual grant by the Government passing title in the land to the Corporation by reason of non compliance with the statutory formalities, yet, inasmuch as the Corporation had never the less taken possession of the land in terms of the Government resolution and continued in such possession openly, uninterruptedly and as of right for over 70 years, the Corporation had acquired the (1) (1866)L.R. 44 limited title it had been prescribing for during the period, that is to say, the right to hold the land in perpetuity free of rent, but only for the purposes of a market and for no other purposes.
The right acquired included as part of it an immunity from payment of rent which constituted a right in limitation of the Government 's right to assess in excess of the specific limit established and preserved by the Government Resolution within the meaning of section 8 of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act (II of 1876) there being for the purposes of this case no distinction between rent and revenue.
Per CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
If the Resolution of 1865 can be read as meaning that the grant was of rent free land the case would come strictly within the doctrine of estoppel enunciated in section 115 of the Indian Evidence Act.
Even otherwise, if there was merely the holding out of a promise that no rent will be charged in the future the Government must be deemed to have bound themselves to fulfil it.
The right to levy assessment is a prerogative right of the Government and it is hard to conceive of a ease where it could be said to be lost by adverse possession.
A court of equity must prevent the perpetration of a legal fraud.
PATANJALI SASTRI J. (contra) The principle of Ramsden vs Dyson cannot prevail against statutory requirements regarding disposition of property or making of contracts by Government.
No question of estoppel by representation arises, as the Government made no representation of fact which it now seeks to deny.
Nor can any case of estoppel by acquiescence be rounded on the facts of the case as there was no lying by and letting another run into a trap.
No right of exemption has been established either on the basis of express or implied contract or on the basis of equitable principles of part performance or estoppel by acquiescence.
The right to levy land revenue is no part of the Govern ment 's right to property but a prerogative of the Crown and adverse possession of the land could not destroy the Crown 's prerogative to impose assessment on the land.

Appeal from a Judgment of the Bombay High Court (Chagla C.J. and Tendolkar J.) dated 25th March, 1949, in Income Tax Reference No. 31 of 1948.
M. C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India (G. N. Joshi, with him) for the appellant.
R.J. Kolah, for the respondent.
Oct. 1.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KANIA C.J.
This is an appeal from a judgment of the High Court at Bombay and it arises out of the opinion ex pressed by the High Court in respect of a question submitted to it by the Income tax Tribunal.
The material facts are these.
The respondent is a textile mills company carrying on the business of manufacturing and selling textile goods.
For the assessment years 1943 44 and '1944 45, covering the accounting periods ending with the calendar years 1941, 1942 and 1943, the respondent claimed the expenditure incurred by it in registering for the first time its trade marks which were not in use prior to the 25th February, 1937, as revenue expenditure and an allowable deduction out of its income for the said periods, under section 10(2) (xv) of the Indian Income tax Act.
Following the decision of the Bombay High Court in Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs The Century Spinning 13 and Weaving and Manufacturing Co. Ltd.(1), the Tribunal allowed the claim of the assessee.
At the desire of the appellant, the Tribunal submitted the following question for the opinion of the High Court : ""Whether, on the facts of the case, the expenditure incurred by the assessee company in registering for the first time its trade marks which were not in use prior to the 25th February, 1937, is revenue expenditure and an allowable deduction under section 10(2) (xv) of the Indian Income tax Act ?"" The High Court, following its previous decision and finding that the fact of the trade marks having come into use after the 25th of February, 1937, made no difference in the result, answered the question in the affirmative.
The Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay, has come on appeal to us.
It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the ques tion whether a certain disbursement was of a capital or revenue nature, has to be decided according to the principle laid down in British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd. vs Atherton(2).
In that case the company which carried on the business of manufacturers of insulated cables established a pension fund for its clerical and technical salaried staff.
The fund was constituted by a trust deed which provided that members should contribute a percentage of their salaries to the fund and that the company should contribute an amount equal to half the contributions of the members; and further that the company should contribute a sum of pound 31,784 to form the nucleus of the fund and to provide the amount necessary in order that past years of service of the then existing staff should rank for pension.
That sum was arrived at by an actuarial calculation on the basis that the sum would ultimately be exhausted when the object for which it was paid was attained.
The House of Lords held that this payment was in the nature of capital expenditure and was therefore not an admissible deduction.
Although in the opinions expressed by the different members of the House of Lords (1) (2) 14 the line of approach is not completely the same, the principle stated by Lord Cave in his speech has been test distinguish capital expenditure from revenue expenditure.
It was recognised that a sum of money expended, not of necessi ty and with a view to a direct and immediate benefit to the trade, but voluntarily and on the grounds of commercial expediency, and in order indirectly to facilitate the carry ing on of business, may yet be expended wholly and exclu sively for the purposes of the trade.
The Lord Chancellor observed that the question appeared to be a question of fact which was proper to be decided by the Commissioners upon the evidence brought before them in each case.
The test that capital expenditure is a thing that is going to be spent once and for all and income expenditure is a thing that is going to recur every year was considered an useful element in arriving at the decision but was not certainly the deci sive fact.
The Lord Chancellor observed as follows: ""But when an expenditure is made, not only once and for all, but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advan tage for the enduring benefit of the trade, I think that there is very good reason for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital.
"" In order to appreciate the true position here Correctly it is next necessary to notice the relevant provisions of the Indian .
It may be noted that before this Act there was no in India but it was recognised that an action lay for infringement of a trade mark independently of an action for passing off goods.
The Act opens with the preamble ""whereas it is expedient to provide for the registration and more effective protection of trade marks . ""Section 2(1) of the Act defines a trade mark as meaning ""a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right to use the mark, whether with or without any indication of the identity of that person.
"" Section 14 permits the 15 proprietor of a trade mark to have the trade mark regis tered.
The Attorney General, on behalf of the appellant, relied on sections 20, 21, 28 and 29 in support of his contention.
He argued that before the , although the proprietor of a trade mark could maintain an action for infringement of his trade mark and the cause of action in such a case was quite different from the cause of action in an action for passing off goods, by the the right of the owner of the trade mark is in creased by section 21, and it is made assignable independ ently of the goodwill under sections 28 and 29 of the .
The question thus resolves itself into whether by reason of these two incidents the case falls within the principle laid down by Lord Chancellor Cave, as mentioned above.
In our opinion, the contention urged on behalf of the appellant must fail.
It is not contended that by the a new asset has come into existence.
It was con tended that an advantage of an enduring nature had come into existence.
It was argued that just as machinery may attain a higher value by an implementation causing greater produc tive capacity, in the present case the trade mark which existed before the acquired an advantage of an enduring nature by reason of the and the fees paid for registration thereunder were in the nature of capital expenditure.
In our opinion, this analogy is falla cious.
The machinery which acquires a greater productive capacity by reason of its improvement by the inclusion of some new invention naturally becomes a new and altered asset by that process.
So long as the machinery lasts, the im provement continues to the advantage of the owner of the machinery.
The replacement of a dilapidated roof.
by a more substantial roof stands on the same footing.
The result however of the is only two fold.
By regis tration, the owner is absolved from the obligation to prove his ownership of the trade mark.
It is treated as prima facie proved on production of the registration certificate.
It thus merely saves him the trouble of leading evidence, in the event of a suit, in a court 16 of law, to prove his title to the trade mark.
It has been said that registration is in the nature of collateral security furnishing the trader with a cheaper and more direct remedy against infringers, Cancel the registration and he has still his right enforceable at common law to restrain the piracy of his trade mark.
In our opinion, 'this is neither such an asset nor an advantage as to make payment for its registration a capital expenditure.
In this connec tion it may be useful to notice that expenditure incurred by a company in defending title to property is not considered expense of a capital nature.
In Southern (H. M. Inspector of Taxes) vs Borax Consolidated Limited(1).
it is there stated that where a sum of money is laid out for the acqui sition or the improvement of a fixed capital asset it is attributable to capital, but if no alteration is made in the fixed capital asset by the payment, then it is properly attributable to revenue, being in substance a matter of maintenance, the maintenance of the capital structure or the capital asset of the company.
In our opinion, the advantage derived by the owner of the trade mark by registration falls within this class of expenditure.
The fact that a trade mark after registration could be separately assigned, and not as a part of the goodwill of the business only, does not also make the expenditure for registration a capital expend iture.
That is only an additional and incidental facility given to the owner of the trade mark.
It adds nothing to the trade mark itself.
In the judgment of the High Court some emphasis is laid on the fact that by reason of registration the duration of the trade mark is only for seven years, and it does not thus possess that permanency which is ordinarily required of an expenditure to make it a capital expenditure and in order to prove the existence of a benefit of an enduring character.
The learned Attorney General contended that the view that as the benefit of registration lasted for seven years, i.e., for a limited period, it prevented the expenses of registra tion being treated as capital expenditure, is unsound (1) [1942] 10 I.T.R. Suppl.
17 and for that contention he relied on Henriksen (Inspector of Taxes) vs Grafton Hotel Ltd.(1).
In that case, tenants of licensing premises by agreement with the landlord paid by instalment the monopoly value fixed by the licensing jus tices when granting the licence under section 14 of the Licensing (Consolidation) Act, 1910.
These were sought to be deducted as revenue expenditure but were disallowed by the Court.
Lord Greene M.R. first considered that the pay ment fell into the same class as the payment of a premium on the grant of a lease or the expenditure on improvements to the property which justices may require to be made as a condition of granting a licence.
Having reached that conclu sion he rejected the argument that the payment not being made in one lump sum but by instalments made a difference in the character of the payment.
He observed as follows : ""Whenever a licence is granted for a term, the payment is made as on a purchase of a monopoly for that term.
When a licence is granted for a subsequent term, the monopoly value must be paid in respect of that term and so on.
The payments are recurrent if the licence is renewed, they are not peri odical so as to give them the quality of payments which ought to be debited to revenue account.
The thing that is paid for is of a permanent quality although its permanence, being conditioned by the length of the term, is shortlived.
A payment of this character appears to me to fall into the same class as the payment of a premium on the grant of a lease, which is admittedly not deductible.
"" The Attorney General relied on these observations to point out that the permanence of the advantage was thus not dependent on the number of years for which it was to enure for the benefit of the proprietor of the trade mark.
In our opinion, these observations have to be read in the context in which they have been made.
The learned Master of the Rolls was discuss ing only the question of payment being made by instalments as not making any difference in the nature of the (1) 3 18 expenditure.
It was first held by him that the payment in question was of a capital nature and of the same character as premium paid on the grant of a lease and was therefore necessarily of a capital nature.
Having come to that conclu sion, he only rejected the contention that because the premium was paid in more instalments than one it lost its character a capital expenditure.
In our opinion, this is an entirely different thing from stating that the fact of the advantage being for a limited time altered the character of the payment in any way.
As observed by Viscount Cave L.C. the question is always one of fact depending on the circumstances of each case individually.
In our opinion, the decision of the High Court reported in Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs The Century Spin ning and Weaving and Manufacturing Co. Ltd.(1) is correct and in the present case also the contention of the appellant must fail.
The appeal therefore fails and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
","The expenditure incurred by a company carrying on the manufacture and sale of textile goods in registering for the first time its trade marks which were not in use prior to the 25th January, 12 1937, is revenue expenditure and an allowable deduction under Sec.
10 (2) (xv) of the Indian Income tax Act.
The fact that a trade mark after registration could be sepa rately assigned and not as a part of the goodwill of the business only, does not make the expenditure for registra tion capital expenditure.
It is only an additional and incidental facility given to the owner of the trade mark; it adds nothing to the trade mark itself.
Judgment of the Bombay High Court affirmed.
Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay vs The Century Spin ning and Weaving and Manufacturing Co. Ltd. ([1947] approved.
British Insulated and Helsby Cables Ltd. vs Atherton ([1926] A.C. 205), Southern vs Borax Con solidated Ltd. ([1942] 10 I.T.R. Supp. 1), Henriksen vs Grafton Hotel Ltd. ([1942] 2 K.B. 184) referred to.

Appeal from a judgment and decree of the High Court of Allahabad (Malik and Wali Ullah JJ.) dated 14th February 1946, in Appeal No. 240 of 1943 which 37 arose out of a decree dated 19th January, 1943, of the Court of the Civil and Sessions.
Judge, Kanpur, in Original Suit No. 34 of 1942.
Achhru Ram (P. section Safeer, with him) for the appellant.
S.P. Sinha (K. N. Aggarwala, with him) for the respond ent. 1951.
November 1.
The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J.
This is an appeal by special leave against a decision of the High Court at Allahabad, reversing the decision of the trial court, in a suit instituted by the appellant to recover damages from the respondent firm for breach of a contract.
It appears that between the 10th and 18th April, 1941, the parties entered into 5 contracts, by which the respond ent firm undertook to supply to the appellant 184 bales of cloth of certain specifications manufactured by the New Victoria Mills, Kanpur, and the Raza Textile Mills, Ramput.
Only 99 bales were taken up and there was a dispute about the remaining 85 bales.
On the 17th October, 1941, a settle ment was arrived at between the parties, and it was agreed that the respondent firm should deliver to the appellant 61 bales, and that the goods should be delivered by the 17th November, 1941.
The actual text of the agreement (exhibit 4) was as follows: "" 61 bales as noted below are to be given to you by us.
We shall continue sending goods as soon as they are prepared to you upto Magsar Badi 15 Sambat 1998.
We shall go on supplying goods to you of the Victoria Mills as soon as they are supplied to us by the said Mill.
(Specifications of cloth given here).
We shall go on deliv ering the goods to you upto Magsar Badi 15 out of the goods noted above which will be prepared by the Mill.
"" 38 As the 61 bales were not supplied, the appellant sent a telegraphic notice to the respondent firm on 20th November, 1941, to the following effect ""Give delivery of our 61 bales through Bank.
Otherwise suing within a days.
"" The appellant did not receive any reply to this notice, and so he instituted the suit which has given rise to this appeal, on the 23rd April, 1942, claiming a sum of Rs. 9,808 and odd, which, according to him, represented the loss sustained by him on account of the rise in the market rate of the contracted goods, and he also claimed costs and interest.
The respondent firm resisted the suit on a number of grounds, but their main plea, with which alone we are concerned in this appeal, was that the performance of the contract had been frustrated by circumstances beyond their control and hence the appellant 's claim must fail.
This plea was negatived by the trial court, but it was upheld by the High Court, and hence this appeal.
The only point which arises in this appeal is whether the circumstances of the case afford any basis for the application of the doctrine of frustration of.
contract, a doctrine which is embodied, so far as this country is con cerned, in sections 32 and 56 of the .
The main grounds of attack against the judgment of the High Court are : (1) that it has misread the agreement (exhibit 4) dated the 17th October, 1941, on which both parties rely; and (2) that it has paid more attention to an abstract legal doctrine than to the facts of the case.
In our opinion, both these contentions are correct.
The construction placed by the High Court upon the agree ment and its conclusion based thereon, are set out in the following passage in the leading judgment of Wali Ullah J. : ""It seems to me that the parties clearly intended that the defendant was to supply the goods to the 39 plaintiff ' if and when and only in that event the particu lar goods were prepared by the Victoria Mills and were supplied to the defendant between the 17th of October, 1941, and 17th of November, 1941.
As the fundamental assumption on which the contract was made ceased to exist during the time of performance and consequently it became impossible for the defendant to fulfil the contract, it must be held that the contract was discharged by supervening impossibility.
"" The construction suggested by the High Court is precise ly the construction which was attempted to be put on a similar contract by the defendant respondents in the case of Harnandrai vs Pragdas (1) but the Privy Council negatived it. ' In that case, the provision as to delivery of goods ran as follows : ""The said goods are to be taken delivery of as and when the same may be received from the Mills."" The Mills failed to perform their contract with the defendants as they were engaged in fulfilling certain con tracts with the Government, and consequently the defendants could not supply the goods to the plaintiffs.
The questions raised before the Privy Council were as to the meaning of the contract and whether its performance had been frustrat ed, and the Privy Council disposed of them in these words : ""It was also suggested that the words 'as and when the same may be received from the Mills ' should be construed, as if they were ' if and when the same may be received from the Mills. ' This is to convert words, which fix the quantities and times for deliveries by instalments into a condition precedent, to the obligation to deliver at all, and virtual ly makes a new contract.
The words certainly regulate the manner of performance, but they do not reduce the fixed quantity sold to a mere maximum, or limit the sale to such goods, not exceeding 864 bales, as the Mills might deliver to the defendants during the remainder of the year.
"" Their Lordships then proceeded to observe: (1) (1888) L.R. 15 I.A. 9. 40 ""The Mills, from which the goods were to come, no doubt were contemplated as continuing to exist, though it does ' not follow that, in a bargain and sale such as this, the closing or even the destruction of the Mills would affect a contract between third parties, which is in terms absolute; but the Mills did continue to exist and did continue to manufacture the goods in question, only they were made for and delivered to somebody else.
"" We agree with the reasoning of the Privy Council, and it seems to us that the considerations which prevailed with them must govern the construction of the agreement with which we are concerned in this case.
The agreement does not seem to us to convey the meaning that the delivery of the goods was made contingent on their being supplied to the respondent firm by the Victoria Mills.
We find it difficult to hold that the parties ever contemplated the possibility of the goods not being supplied at all.
The words ""prepared by the Mill"" are only a description of the goods to be supplied, and the expressions ""as soon as they are prepared"" and ""as soon as they are supplied to us by the said Mill"" simply indicate the process of delivery.
It should be remem bered that what we have to construe is a commercial agree ment entered into in a somewhat common form, and, to use the words of Lord Sumner in the case to which reference has been made, ""there is nothing surprising in a merchant 's binding himself to procure certain goods at all events, it being a matter of price and of market expectations.
"" Since the true construction of an agreement must depend upon the import of the words used and not upon what the parties choose to say afterwards, it is unnecessary to refer to what the parties have said about it.
Even apart from the construction of the agreement, it seems to us that the plea of the respondents must fail on their own admissions.
The defendant has stated in his evidence that he had not sold the 61 bales of cloth to any other person at the time he received the telegraphic notice of the 20th November, 1941, (exhibit 1).
On his own admis sion, therefore, he was 41 in a position to supply 61 bales of the contracted goods at the time when the breach of the agreement is alleged to have happened.
That being so, we are unable to hold that the performance of the contract had become impossible.
The matter however does not rest there.
Guruprasad, a clerk of the Mills Company, who is the second witness for the defend ants, has made an important statement to the following effect ""The customers all place their requirements before the sales manager.
If the goods required are ready, they are sold to the customers and if they are not ready and if the customer wants them to be manufactured they are delivered to the customers after manufacture.
An order book is main tained at the Mills.
"" Such being the practice which prevailed in the Victoria Mills, it was for the defendants to show that an order for the manufacture of the contracted goods was placed with the Mills and yet the Mills failed to supply the goods.
No such evidence has however been offered by the defendants The High Court has surmised that it might not have been possible to supply the goods within the period mentioned in the agreement, but there is no material to support that state ment.
In these circumstances, this is obviously not a case in which the doctrine of frustration of contract can be in voked.
That doctrine has been explained in a number of cases, some of which are referred to in the judgment of the High Court, but the latest pronouncement with regard to it is to be found in the speech of Viscount Simon in British Movietone News vs London Cinemas(1), in which the Lord Chancellor referred with approval to the following enuncia tion of the doctrine by Earl Loreburn in a previous case F.A. Tamplin S.S. Co. Ltd. vs Anglo Mexican Petroleum Products Co., Ltd(2): "". a court can and ought to examine the contract and the circumstances in which it was made, not of course (1) ; (2) , 404.
6 42 to vary, but only to explain it, in order to see whether or not from the nature of it the parties must have made their bargain on the footing that a particular thing or state of things would continue ,to exist.
And if they must have done so, then a term to that effect will be implied, though it be not expressed in the contract . no court has an absolving power, but it can infer from the nature of the contract and the surrounding circumstances that a condition which is not expressed was a foundation on which the par ties contracted,"" It seems necessary for us to emphasize that so far as the courts in this country are concerned, they must look primarily to the law as embodied in sections 32 and 56 of the .
These sections run as fol lows : ""32.
Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if an uncertain future event happens cannot be enforced by law unless and until that event has happened.
If the event becomes impossible such contracts become void."" ""56.
An agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void.
A contract to do an act which, after the contract is made, becomes impossible, or, by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful. .
The enforcement of the agreement in question was, as we have already pointed out, not contingent on the happening of an uncertain future event, nor does the present case fall within the second paragraph of section 56, which is the only provision which may be said to have any relevancy to the plea put forward by the respondents.
Clearly, the doctrine of frustration cannot avail a defendant, when the non per formance of a contract is attributable to his own default.
We accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the High Court, and restore the decree of the trial court.
The appellant will be entitled to his costs through out.
Appeal allowed.

","The respondents agreed to deliver 61 bales of cloth to the appellant by the 17th November, 1941.

We shall go on supplying goods to you of the Victoria Mills as soon as they are supplied to us by the said Mills .

"" In a suit for damages for non deliv ery of the goods the respondents pleaded that as they had not received the goods from the Victoria Mills before the 17th of November, 1941, performance of the contract had become impossible by reason of an event which they could not prevent and the contract had therefore become void under Sec.

This was not therefore a case in which the doctrine of frustration of contract could be invoked.

This is a litigation between two branches of a family whose common ancestor was one Megh Raj Singh The family tree is as follows: Megh Raj Singh Jawahar Singh Madan Singh Shankar Lal(d 1884) Brijlal (d. 1889 or (1890) Daughter: Met.

1 Plff.2.
Dhiyan Singh Jai Bhagwan Singh Deft.
1 Deft. 2 Ghas Ram Onkar Prasad The dispute is about property which, according to the plaintiffs, formed part of Shanker Lal 's estate.
The plain tiffs state that the two branches of the family were sepa rate at all material times; that on 480 Shanker Lal 's death in 1884 his daughter Mst.
Mohan Dei (the defendants ' grandmother) succeeded to a limited estate.
The reversion opened out on her death in October 1929 and the plaintiffs are entitled as the next reversioners, for Mst.
Mohan Dei 's son Shri Kishan Das predeceased her.
The defendants admit that Shanker Lal was separate from the other branch of the family.
They divide the property which their grandmother Mst.
Mohan Dei possessed into two categories.
First, there was property which they say be longed to her.
These are properties which, according to them, she purchased or obtained under mortgages in her own right.
Next, there were properties which belonged exclu sively to her father and to which she succeeded as daughter.
On Shanker Lal 's death disputes arose between Shanker Lal 's father 's brother 's son Brijlal (the plaintiffs ' grandfa ther) and the defendants ' grandmother Mst.
Mohan Dei.
Brijlal claimed the entire estate by survivorship, his allegation being that Shanker Lal died in a state of joint ness with him and that all the properties were joint family properties.
This dispute was referred to arbitration and an award was delivered.
Under it Mst.
Mohan Dei was given the suit properties as absolute owner and the rest of the estate then in dispute was given to Brijlal, A division was ef fected accordingly and ever since, that is to say, from 21 12 1884, the date of the award, down to 26 3 1941, the date of the suit, each branch has been in separate and uninter rupted possession of the properties respectively allotted to it and each has been dealing with them as absolute owner.
The defendants claim that the plaintiffs are bound by this award and are in any event estopped.
The plaintiffs lost in the first Court but won in the High Court.
The defendants appeal.
The first question is about the nature of the award.
The defendants say that it gave Mst.
Mohan Dei an absolute estate.
The plaintiffs deny this and say she obtained only a limited estate.
In our opinion, the defendants are right.
481 The question at issue is a simple one of construction.
The award is exhibit A 1.
The operative portion runs thus: ""Having regard to the specifications give above, Brij Lal, first party, and Musammat Mohan Devi, the deceased 's female issue, second party, have been held entitled to shares, worth Rs. 28,500 and Rs. 42,482 10 0 respective ly in the said properties; and accordingly. two lots have been made and the first lot is allotted to the first party and the second lot to the second party; and henceforth the parties shall have no claim or liability against each other; and each party has become permanent owner (malikmustaqil) of his or her share; and each party should enter in proprietary possession and occupation of his or her respective share. "" The underlining is ours.
We do not think the words admit of any doubt, particu larly as the words ""malik mustaqil"" have been used: see Ram Gopal vs Nand Lal and Others (1) and Bishunath Prasad Singh vs Chandika Prasad Kumari (2).
But it was argued that the award must be viewed as a whole and that certain earlier passages show that this could not have been the intention. ]he passages relied on are these.
First, the finding that the properties claimed by Mst.
Mohan Dei as her own really belonged to Shanker Lal.
He had purchased some and acquired others through mortgages in her name but she was only a benamidar and had no title to them.
Second, that some of the properties in dispute were ancestral and the rest sell acquired, though whether with the help of ances tral funds or not the arbitrator was unable to determine.
Third, the arbitrator 's view of the Hindu law, namely that ""the brother should be the owner of the joint ancestral property and the daughter who has a male issue should be owner of the self acquired property.
"" And lastly, this passage (1) ; at 773.(2)(1933) 60 I.A. 56 at 61 & 62. 482 ""Furthermore, when the 2nd party (Mohan Dei) has inher ited no property from her husband, she, in case of getting this share, will certainly settle down in Amroha and will make her father 's haveli as her abode and thus the haveli shall remain a bad as heretofore, and in this way the de ceased 's name will be perpetuated; and it is positive that, after the Musammat, this property shall devolve on her son, who will be the malik (owner) thereof, and later the de scendant of this son will become the owner thereof.
"" We do not think these passages qualify the operative portion of the award and are unable to agree with the learned Judges of the High Court who hold they do.
In our opinion, the arbitrator was confused in his mind both as regards the facts as well as regards the law.
His view of the law may have been wrong but the words used are, in our opinion, clear and, in the absence of anything which would unambiguously qualify them, we must interpret them in their usual sense.
Some cases were cited in which the word ""malik"", and in one case the words ""malik mustaqil"" were held to import a limited estate because of qualifying circumstances.
We think it would be pointless to examine them because we are concerned here with the document before us and even if it be conceded that words which would ordinarily mean one thing can be qualified by other words and circumstances appearing in the same document, we are of opinion that the passages and circumstances relied on in this case do not qualify the strong, clear and unambiguous words used in this document.
The learned counsel for the plaintiffs respondents had to search diligently for the meaning for which he contended in other passages and had to make several assumptions which do not appear on the face of the award as to what the arbitra tor must have thought and must have intended.
We are not prepared to qualify clear and unambiguous language by phrases of dubious import which can be made to coincide with either view by calling in aid assumptions of fact about whose existence we can only guess 483 The award was attacked on other grounds also.
It was urged, among other things, that the arbitrator had travelled beyond the terms of his reference in awarding Mst.
Mohan Dei an absolute interest.
It was also urged that even if Brij lal was bound his son Kishan Lal, who did not claim through him but who had an independent title as reversioner to Shanker Lal, would not be bound, and it was contended that if Kishan Lal was not bound the plaintiffs would not be either.
But we need not examine these points because we do not need to proceed on the binding nature of the award.
Even if the award be invalid we are of opinion that the plaintiffs ' claim is completely answered by the plea of estoppel.
Now it can be conceded that before an estoppel can arise, there must be, first, a representation of an existing fact as distinct from a mere promise de futuro made by one party to the other; second, that the other party, believing it, must have been induced to act on the faith of it; and third, that he must have so acted to his detriment.
It will be necessary to deal with this in stages and first we will consider whether there was any estoppel against Brijlal.
It is beyond dispute that he laid serious claim to the property in 1884.
He claimed that he was joint with Shanker Lal and so, on Shanker Lal 's death he became entitled to the whole of the estate and that Mst.
Mohan Dei had only a right of maintenance.
Whether he would have had difficulty in establishing such a claim, or indeed whether it would have been impossible for him to do so, is wholly immaterial.
The fact remains that he pressed his claim and was serious about it, so much so that he was able to per suade the arbitrator that he had an immediate right to part of the estate.
Mohan Dei, on the other hand, resisted this claim and contended that she was entitled to separate and exclusive possession, and in any event, that she was entitled in absolute right to a part of the property.
On the facts which now emerge it is evident that Brijlal had no right and that his hopes of one day succeeding as 484 reversioner were remote.
Mohan Dei had a son Shri Kishan Das who was the next presumptive reversioner and as the boy was a good deal younger than Brijlal, Brijlal 's chances were slim.
Actually, the boy survived Brijlal by nearly forty years.
Brijlal died in 1889or 1890 and the boy did not die till March 1929.
Had he lived another eight or nine months he would have succeeded and the plaintiffs would have been nowhere.
Now this dispute, seriously pressed by both sides, was referred to arbitration.
It is neither here nor there whether the award was valid, whether the decision fell within the scope of the reference or whether it had any binding character in itself.
Even if it was wholly invalid, it was still open to the parties to say: Never mind whether the arbitrator was right or wrong, his decision is fair and sensible, so instead of wasting further time and money in useless litigation, we will accept it and divide the estate in accordance with his findings.
That would have been a perfectly right and proper settlement of the dispute, and whether it bound third parties or not it would certainly bind the immediate parties; and that in effect is what they did.
By his conduct Brijlal induced Mst.
Mohan Dei to be lieve that this would be the case and on the faith of that representation, namely the acceptance of the award, he induced Mst.
Mohan Dei to act greatly to her detriment and to alter her position by accepting the award and parting with an appreciable portion of the estate, and he himself obtained a substantial advantage to which he would not otherwise have been entitled and enjoyed the benefit of it for the rest of his life; and to his credit be it said, he never attempted to go behind his decision.
In any event, we are clear that that created an estoppel as against Brijlal.
In our opinion, the present case is very similar to the one which their Lordships of the Privy Council decided in Kanhai Lal vs Brij Lal (1).
There also there was a dispute between a limited owner and a person who, but for an un proved claim (adoption) which he (1) (1919) 45 I.A. 118.
485 put forward, had no right to the estate.
The dispute was taken to the courts but was compromised and according to the agreement the property was divided between the two rival claimants and the agreement was given effect to and acted on for a period of twenty years.
Later, the succession opened out and the other party to the compromise, who by then had stepped into the reversion, claimed the rest of the estate, which had been assigned to the limited owner, against her personal heirs.
The Judicial Committee rejected the claim on the ground of estoppel and held that even though the plaintiff claimed in a different character in the suit, namely as reversioner, he having been a party to the compro mise and having acted on it and induced the other side to alter her position to her detriment, was estopped.
We do not think the fact that there was a voluntary compromise whereas here there was the imposed decision of an arbitra tor.
makes any difference because we are not proceeding on the footing of the award but on the actings of the parties in accepting it when they need not have done so if the present contentions are correct.
It is true that in one sense a question of title is one of law and it is equally true that there can be no estoppel on a question of law.
But every question of law must be grounded on facts and when Brijlal 's conduct is analysed it will be found to entail an assertion by him that he admitted and recognised facts which would in law give Mst.
Mohan Dei an absolute interest in the lands awarded to her.
It was because of that assertion of fact, namely his recognition and admission of the existence of facts which would give Mst.
Mohan Dei an absolute interest, that she was induced to part with about one third of the property to which Brijlal, on a true estimate of the facts as now known, had no right.
There can be no doubt that she acted to her detriment and there can, we think, be equally no doubt that she was in duced to do so on the faith of Brijlal 's statements and conduct which induced her to believe that he accepted all the implications of the 63 486 award.
But in any event, we are clear that Brijlal would have been estopped.
The nature of the dispute and the de scription of it given in the award show that there was considerable doubt, and certainly much dispute, about the true state of affairs.
Even if the arbitrator was wholly wrong and even if he had no power to decide as he did, it was open to both sides to accept the decision and by their acceptance recognise the existence of facts which would in law give the other an absolute estate in the properties they agreed to divide among themselves and did divide.
That, in our opinion is a representation of an existing fact or set of facts.
Each would consequently be estopped as against the other and Brijlal in particular would have been estopped from denying the existence of facts which would give Mst.
Mohan Dei an absolute interest in the suit property.
We turn next to his son Kishan Lal.
Brijlal died in 1889 or 1890.
At that date Mst.
Mohan Dei 's son Shri Kishan Das was alive and was the next presumptive reversioner.
Brijlal 's sons therefore had no more right to that portion of his estate which was assigned to Brijlal than Brijlal himself.
But they took possession and claimed through their father. ]hey did not claim an independent title in them selves, and, as we know, they had no other title at that date.
They were therefore in no better position than Brij lal and as Brijlal would have been estopped, the estoppel descended to them also because they stepped into his shoes.
This would be so even if Brijlal had claimed the property independently for himself, which he did not; but much more so as he claimed in joint family rights and evidently acted as karta or manager on behalf of his family.
But apart from this, there was also an independent estoppel in Kishan Lal.
We have said, he had no right to this part of the estate when his father died apart from the award.
But nevertheless he took possession along with his brother and the two of them treated the property as their own and derived benefit 487 from it.
They partitioned the estate between themselves and sold away parts of it to third parties.
Kishan Lal knew of the award.
He knew that mutation had been effected in accordance with it and possession taken by Brijlal under it and that the rest had been retained by Mst.
Mohan Dei.
His retention of the property therefore and his continuing to deal with it on the basis of the award indicated his own acceptance of the award and, therefore, by his acts and conduct, he represented that he also, like his father, admitted the existence of facts which would in law give Mst.
Mohan Dei an absolute estate; and further, he allowed Mst.
Mohan Dei to deal with the estate as her own, for she, on her part.
also acted on the award and claimed absolute rights in the property assigned to her.
She dealt with it on that footing and gifted it in that right to her grand sons, the contesting defendants, on 4th April, 1929.
Muta tion was effected and Kishan Lal raised no objection.
We see then that Brijlal retained possession of property to which he was not entitled for a period of five or six years from 1884 to 1889 or 1890 and induced Mst.
Mohan Dei to part with it by representing that he accepted the award and her abso lute title to the rest, and after him Kishan Lal and his brother between them enjoyed the benefit of it from 1889 or 1890 down to October 1929 when Mst.
Mohan Dei died, that is, for a further forty years, and led Mst.
Mohan Dei to believe that they also acknowledged her title to an absolute estate.
We have no doubt that down to that time Kishan Lal was also estopped for the reasons given above.
Had he questioned the award and reopened the dispute Mst.
Mohan Dei would at once have sued and would then for forty years have obtained the benefit of property from which she was excluded because of her acceptance of the award on the faith of Brijlal 's asser tion that he too accepted it.
Kishan Lal 's inaction over these years with full knowledge of the facts, as is evident from the deposition of D.W. 2, Dhiyan Singh, whose testimony is uncontradicted, and his acceptance of the estate with all its consequential benefits, unquestionably creates an estoppel in him.
This witness tells us that 488 ""Kishanlal always accepted this award and acted upon it.
"" He qualifies this in cross examination by saying that Kishan Lal had also objected to it but the witness did not know whether that was before or after Mst.
Mohan Dei 's death.
The documents filed show it was after, so there is no reason why the main portion of his statement which is uncontradicted, and which could have been contradicted, should not be accepted.
In March, 1929, Mst.
Mohan Dei 's son Shri Kishan Das died and Kishan Lal thereupon became the next presumptive reversioner, and in October, 1929, when the reversion opened out the estate vested in him, or rather would have vested in him but for the estoppel.
The question therefore is, did he continue to be bound by the estoppel when he assumed a new character on the opening out of the reversion ? We have no doubt he did.
The decision of the Judicial Committee which we have just cited, Kanhai Lal vs Brijlal(1), is, we think, clear on that point.
Although other reversioners who do not claim through the one who has consented are not bound.
the consenting reversioner is estopped.
This is beyond dispute when there is an alienation by a limited owner without legal necessity.
See Ramgouda Annagouda vs Bhausaheb (2) where the ground of decision was "". .but
Annagouda himself being a party to and benefiting by the transaction evidenced thereby was preclud ed from questioning any part of it.
"" In our opinion, the same principles apply to a case of the present kind.
It was contended, however, on the strength of Rangasami Gounden vs Nachiappa Gounden(3) and Mr. Binda Kuer vs Lalitha Prasad(4), that even if Kishan Lal did take posses sion in 1889or 1890 on the strength of a title derived from his father, that would not have precluded him from asserting his own rights in a different character when the succession opened (1)(1918) 45 I.A 118.

(4) (1936) A.I.R. 1936 P.C. 304 at 308.
489 out.
Reliance in particular was placed upon page 808 of the latter ruling.
In our opinion, that decision is to be distinguished.
In that case the reversion did not fall in till 1916.
Long before that, namely in 1868, the next presumptive reversioners entered into a compromise whereby the grandfa ther of one Jairam who figured in that case obtained a good deal more than he Would have been entitled to in the ordi nary way.
But for the compromise this grandfather would have got only one anna 12 gundas share, whereas due to the compromise he got as much as 2 annas 4 gundas, The actual taking of possession was however deferred under the compro mise till the death of one Anandi Kuer.
She died in 1885 and on that date Jairam was entitled to his grandfather 's share as both his father and grandfather were dead.
Jairam accordingly reaped the benefit of the transaction.
But it is to be observed that the extra benefit which he derived was only as to a 12 gundas share because he had an absolute and indefeasible right to 1 anna 12 gundas in any event in his own right under a title which did not spring from the com promise.
Jairam lost 1 anna 4 gundas to a creditor Munniram and out of the one anna which he had left from the 2 annas 4 gundas he sold 13 gundas to the plaintiffs for a sum of Rs. 500.
Now it is evident that on those facts it is impossible to predicate that the 13 gundas which the plaintiffs pur chased came out of the extra 12 gundas which Jairam obtained because of the compromise rather than out of the 1 anna 12 gundas to which he had a good and independent title anyway; and of course unless the plaintiffs ' 13 gundas could be assigned with certainty to the 12 gundas it would be impos sible to say that they had obtained any benefit from the compromise.
The Judicial Committee also added that even if it was possible to assign this 13 gundas with certainty to the 12 gundas it by no means followed that the plaintiffs admitted that fact nor would that necessarily have given them a benefit under the compromise.
They had the right to contest 'the 490 position and gamble on the possibility of being able to prove the contrary.
Their Lordships added "" Unless the plaintiffs ' individual conduct makes it unjust that they should have a place among Bajrangi Lal 's reversioners their legal rights should have effect.
"" In the other case, Rangasami Gounden vs Nachiappa Goun den(1), their Lordships ' decision about this matter turned on the same sort of point: see page 87.
The present case is very different.
When Kishan Lal took possession of his father 's property he held by virtue of the award and under no other title, and for forty years he continued to derive benefit from it.
Accordingly, he would have been estopped even if he had claimed in a differ ent character as reversioner after the succession opened out.
It was conceded that if the estoppel against Kishan Lal enured after October 1929, then the plaintiffs, who claim through Kishan Lal, would also be estopped.
The appeal succeeds.
The decree of the High Court is set aside and that of the first Court dismissing the plaintiffs ' claim is restored.
Costs here and in the High Court will be borne by the plaintiffs respondents.
Appeal allowed.
(1) (1919) 46 I.A. 72.
","S and B were sons of two brothers respectively.
S died in 1884 leaving a daughter M, surviving him.
On the death of S dispute arose between B and M. B claimed the entire estate by survivorship, alleging that S died in a state of jointness with him and that all the properties were joint family properties and M was entitled only to maintenance.
The dispute was referred to arbitration and an award was delivered.
Under it the suit properties were given to M and the rest of the estate then in dispute was given to B.
The operative part of the award stated inter alia that B, first party, and M, the second party, were held entitled to speci fied shares in the properties in dispute and each had become permanent owner (Malik Mustaqil) of his or her share.
A division was effected and ever since the date of the award in 1884 each branch continued in possession of the proper ties allotted to it and each had been dealing with them as absolute owner.
The defendants claimed that the plaintiffs were bound by the award and were in any event estopped from challenging it.
In 1941 B 's grandsons instituted a suit claiming the properties allotted to M claiming that on the death of S his daughter M succeeded to a limited estate and reversion opened out on her death in 1929 and the plain tiffs were entitled as next reversioners, as M 's son had predeceased her.
The defendants (Ms grandsons) alleged that the property possessed by M consisted partly of property which belonged to her and partly of property which belonged exclusively to her father to which she succeeded as daughter.
Held, that the award gave an absolute estate to M as the words ""Malik Mustaqil"" were strong.
clear and unambiguous and were not qualified by.

Appeal from the Judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Patna dated 22nd November, 1944, in Appeal No. 238 of 1940 arising out of order dated 13th July, 1940, of the Subordinate Judge of Bhagalpur in Mis.
Case No. 174 of 1939.
The facts of the case appear from the judgment.
The appeal was originally preferred to the Privy Council and was subse quently transferred and heard by the Supreme Court.
N.C. Chatterjee (B. Sen, with him) for the appellant.
B.C De (Raghunath Jha, with him) for the respond ents.

October 26.
The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by DAs J.
This appeal has come up for hearing before us on transfer from the Privy Council.
The appellant is the present holder of Taluk Kakwara which appertains to Mahalat Kharakpur.
The respondents represent the Banaili Raj which has also acquired the Mahalat of Kharakpur.
The respondents obtained a decree for Rs. 11,587 14 6 against the appellant for arrears of rent and cess and applied for execution of their decree by the attachment and sale of Taluk Kakwara.
On August 29, 1939, the appellant judgment debtor filed an objection under section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure alleging that as Taluk Kakwara was held on Ghatwali tenure it could not be sold in execution of a money decree.
This objection was rather too wide, for all lands held on Ghatwa li tenure were not necessarily inalienable.
Indeed, in Kali Pershad Singh vs Anund Roy(1) which related to the Ghatwali Mahal of Kharna within the Mahalat of Kharakpur the evidence clearly established a number of instances in which there had been unquestioned transfers and sales applicable to Mahals in Kharakpur and it was held by the Privy Council that the true view to take was that such a tenure in Kharakpur was not inalienable, and might be transferred by the Ghatwal or sold in execution of a decree against him, if such transfer or sale was assented to by the Zamindar.
A sale at the instance of the Zamindar in execution of a decree for ar rears of rent necessarily implies the existence of such assent.
In the later case of Narayan Singh vs Niranjan Chakravarti(2) which related to the Ghatwali Mahal of Hand wa, Lord Sumner recognised that the decision of the Privy Council in the Kharna Ghatwali Mahal case was fully support ed by the evidence adduced in that case and that that authority had been repeatedly followed and applied in India, and, so far as the reports showed, without proof of the custom being required over again.
Lord Sumner, however, pointed out that (1) (1887) L.R. 15 I.A. Cal.
(2) (1923) L.R. 51 I.A. Pat. 184; A.I.R. (1924) P.C. 5.
9 66 it was plain that as the custom depended on proof, and as the tenure in question was one in the Zamindari of Kharakpur and under its Zamindar, it could have no reference to Ghat wali tenures not under him nor forming part of his Zamind ari.
The Privy Council in the later case referred to above saw no ground for thinking that the custom of Kharakpur had any application to Ghatwali tenures, which, like Handwa, were independent of the Kharakpur Zamindari, even though they might be not far off Kharakpur.
In short, it may be said to be well established and the contrary has not been urged before us that Ghatwali tenures held under the Zamindar of Kharakpur were, by custom judicially recognised, alienable with the assent of the Zamindar while Ghatwali tenures like Handwa held under the Government direct were inalienable.
In this state of the authorities, the appellant judgment debtor on May 31, 1940, filed a fresh petition of objection under section 47 of the Code claiming that Taluk Kakwara was held under a Government Ghatwali tenure.
The principal question for determination in those execution proceedings was whether Taluk Kakwara was a Government Ghatwali, as alleged by the appellant judgment debtor, or was a Zamindari Ghatwali held under themselves, as claimed by the Respondents decree holders.
The learned Subordinate Judge held that Taluk Kakwara was a Zamindari Ghatwali under the Raja of Kharakpur and overruled the objection of the judgment debtor.
The judg ment debtor appealed to the High Court.
The appeal came up for hearing in the first instance before a Bench consisting of Manohar Lal and Shearer JJ.
Manohar Lal J. came to the conclusion that Taluk Kakwara was a Government Ghatwali and was inclined to allow the appeal.
Shearer J. took the view that while Taluk Kakwara was at one time a Government Ghat wali, it ceased to be so and became and remained a Zamindari Ghatwali and as such was alienable and was inclined to dismiss the appeal.
In view of this difference of opinion the appeal was referred to Chatterjee J, as the third Judge 67 Chatterjee J. held that Taluk Kakwara was a Zamindari Ghat wali land as such alienable and accordingly dismissed the appeal.
The judgment debtor obtained leave to appeal to the Privy Council.
As already stated, the appeal has come up for hearing before us on transfer from the Privy Council.
Although the exact origin of the Ghatwali tenures was generally lost in the confusion and obscurity of the trou blous times which preceded the British rule, the nature of the Ghatwali tenures and their purposes and incidents have been fully established by a series of decided cases.
The position of the Zamindars in or about 1765, when the East India Company secured the Dewani of Bengal, Bihar and Oris sa, has been described by the Right Hon 'ble T. Pemberton Leigh (who subsequently became Lord Kingsdown) in his judg ment in the case of Raja Lelanund Singh vs Government Ben gal(1): Many of the greater Zamindars within their respective Zamindaries, were entrusted with rights, and charged with duties, which properly belonged to the Government.
They had authority to collect from the Ryots a certain portion of the gross produce of the lands.
They, in many cases, imposed taxes and levied toils, and they increased their income by fees, perquisites, and similar exactions, not wholly unknown to more recent times and more civilised nations.
On the other hand, they were bound to maintain peace and order, and administer justice within their Zamindaries, and, for that purpose, they had to keep up Courts of civil and criminal justice, to employ Kazees, Canoongoes, and Thanahdars, or a police force.
But while as against the Ryots and other inhabitants within their territories, many of these poten tates exercised almost regal authority, they were, as against the Government, little more than stewards or admin istrators.
Their Zamindaries were granted to them only from year to year; the amount of their jumma, or yearly payment to Government, was varied, or might be varied annually; it was an arbitrary sum fixed by the Government (1) (1855) 6 M.I.A. 101 at p. 108.
68 officers, calculated upon the gross produce of the Zamindary from all sources, after making an allowance to the Zamindar for his maintenance, and for the expenses of the collection and of discharging the public duties with which he was entrusted by the Government."" Further down his Lordship observed ""Besides the disorder which prevailed generally ' 'Besides the disorder which prevailed generally through the Prov inces, particular Districts were exposed to ravages of a different description.
The mountain or hill districts in India were at this time inhabited by lawless tribes, assert ing a wild independence, often of a different race and different religion from the inhabitants of the plains, who were frequently subjected to marauding expeditions by their more warlike neighbours.
To prevent these incursions it was necessary to guard and watch the Ghats, or mountain passes, through which these hostile descents were made; and the Mahomedan rulers established a tenure called Ghatwali ten ure, by which lands were granted to individuals, often of high rank, at a low rent, or without rent, on condition of their performing these duties, and protecting and preserving order in the neighbouring Districts."" This description of the nature and incidents of a Ghat wali tenure was adopted by the High Court Garth C.J. and McDonell J.) in Leelanund Singh vs Thakoor Munranjan Singh(1) which was a case between the respective predeces sors of the parties before us and related to this very Taluk Kakwara.
Said the learned Chief Justice at p. 255: ""And it is very necessary for our present purpose to bear in mind what was the true origin and nature of these tenures.
They were created by the Mahomedan Government in early times, as a means of providing a police and military force to watch and guard the mountain passes from the inva sions of the lawless tribes who inhabited the hill dis tricts.
Large grants of land were made in those days by the Government.
(1) Cal.
69 often to persons of high rank, at a low rent, or at no rent at all, upon condition that they should provide and maintain a sufficient military force, to protect the inhabitants of the plains from these lawless incursions; and the grantees on their part sub divided and re granted the lands to other tenants (much in the same way as military tenures were created in England in the feudal age), each of whom, besides paying generally a small rent, held their lands in consider ation of these military services, and provided (each accord ing to the extent of his holding) a specified number of armed men to fulfil the requirements of the Government"".
As has been said by Lord Kingsdown in Raja Lelanund Singh vs The Government of Bengal (supra) at p. 125 ""though the nature and extent of the right of the Ghatwals in the Ghatwali villages may be doubtful, and probably differed in different districts and in different families, there clearly was some ancient law or usage by which these lands were appropriated to reward the services of Ghatwals; services which, although they would include the performance of duties of police, were quite as much in their origin of a military as a civil character, and would require the appointment of a very different class of persons from ordinary police offi cers"".
Accordingly his Lordship found that the office of Ghatwal in the Kharakpur Zamindari was frequently held ' by persons of high rank.
In Munrunjan Singh vs Raja Lelanund(1) which was also a case between the respective predecessors of the parties before us and related to this very Taluk Kakwa ra, the High Court at p. 86 observed : ""It appears that there is considerable variety in the tenures known under the general name of Ghatwali in differ ent parts of the country.
They all agree in this that they are grants of land situated on the edge of the hilly coun try, and held on condition of guarding the ghats or passes.
Generally, there seems to be a small quit rent payable to the Zamindar in addition to the service rendered, and with the view of marking (1) 70 the subordination of the tenure.
But in some Zamindaries and putnees these tenures are of a major, in others of a minor, character.
Sometimes the tenure of the great Zamin dar himself seems to have been originally of this character.
More frequently large tenures, consisting of several whole villages, are held under the Zamindar.
"" Further down their Lordships said : ""These inferior Ghatwalis seem to be those in which the Zamindar or ruling power deals direct with the individuals who do the work, assigning them pieces of land in the estab lished villages.
The larger tenures were more of the nature of semi military colonies, where a chief with his followers were settled down in parts of the country so unsafe that it could not be otherwise occupied.
"" The law relating to Ghatwali tenures has been dealt with at considerable length by Lord Sumner in Narayan Singh vs Niranjan Chakravarti (supra).
The variety of conditions of service to be rendered by a Ghatwal was thus summed up by his Lordship at pp.
80 51 : ""In itself 'ghatwal ' is a term meaning an office held by a particular person from time to time, who is bound to the performance of its duties, with a consideration to be en joyed in return by the incumbent of the office.
Within this meaning the utmost variety of conditions may exist.
There may be a mere personal contract of employment for wages, which take the form of the use of land or an actual estate in land, heritable and perpetual, but conditional upon services certain or services to be demanded.
The office may be public or private, important or the reverse.
The Ghatwal, the guard of the pass may be the bulwark of a whole country side against invaders; he may be merely a sentry against petty marauders ;he may be no more than a kind of game keeper, protecting the crops from the ravages of wild ani mals.
Ghatwali duties may be divided into police duties and quasi military duties, though both classes have lost much of their importance, and the 71 latter in any strict form are but rarely rendered.
Again, the duties of the office may be such as demand personal discharge by the Ghatwal and personal competence for that discharge; they may, on the other hand, be such as can be discharged vicariously, by the creation of shikmi tenures and by the appointment and maintenance of a subordinate force, or they may be such as in their nature only require to be provided for in bulk.
It is plain that where a grant is forthcoming to a man and his heirs as Ghatwal, or is to be presumed to have been made though it may have since been lost, personal performance of the ghatwali services is not essential so long as the grantee is responsible for them and procures them to be rendered: Shib Lal Singh vs Moorad Khan, (1868) 9 Suth.
W.R. 126.
"" Then his Lordship pointed out that the superior who appointed the Ghatwal might be the ruling power over the country at large, the landholder responsible by custom for the maintenance of security and order within his estates, or simply the private person, to whom the maintenance of watch men was, in the case of an extensive property, important enough to require the creation of a regular office.
Al though personal service by the employee and personal selec tion and appointment by the employer might have been ordi narily essential incidents of the relationship, yet it was not invariably so as appears from the last quotation as well as from the following passage in the judgment by Lord Sumner at p. 52 : ""On the other hand, there are great estates, whose proprietors are found holding them or parts of them upon the terms of providing that ghatwali services shall be forthcom ing, either regularly or when required; services it is impossible for the proprietor himself to render in his own person, and which become possible to him and to those to whom he renders them simply by virtue of his possession of the lands thus granted.
In such eases the ghatwali tenure, even if not originally granted as heritable, easily becomes so, and is commonly found on the death of an incumbent of the 72 office to descend to some member of his family, if not necessarily to the senior member.
Thus in Kharakpur ghatwals have a perpetual hereditary tenure at a fixed jama: Munrun jun Singh vs Lelanund Singh.
"" The requirement of rendering of services by a Ghatwal naturally gave rise to a further incident of such a tenure, namely, the inalienability of the Ghatwali lands, for an alienation of the Ghatwali lands might easily deprive the Ghatwal of the whole of the means provided to enable the services to be rendered.
This consideration peculiarly applied where the superior, by whom the Ghatwals were ap pointed and of whom the Ghatwali lands were held.
was the ruling power itself.
As has already been stated above, the rigour of this incident of inalienability had, however, in the case of Kharakpur Zamindari Ghatwalis, given way to custom recognised as well established in the case of Kali Petshad vs Anund Roy (supra), which has been repeatedly followed and applied in India without proof of the custom being required over again.
From what has been stated above, it clearly follows that Ghatwali tenures originated during the Moghul period, that although the services included police duties, they were in their origin just as much of a military as a civil character and that the tenure could be granted by the ruling power directly to the Ghatwal who was to render the services so as to establish a direct privity between the ruling power and the Ghatwal or it could be granted by the Zamindar for the protection of his Zamindari or for.
enabling him to render the police and military services 'to the ruling power which he was bound to do under the terms of the grant of Zamindari to him.
The question then arises which of these catego ries the Ghatwals of Kharakpur come under.
Mahalat Kharakpur was an extensive estate and apparently owed allegiance, real or nominal, to the Moghul Emperor.
There is no evidence on record showing on what terms the Raja of Kharakpur held the estate under the Moghuls and it is difficult to say, 73 with any amount of certainty, what kind or amount of serv ices, police or military, he had to render to the then ruling power.
It may, however, be safely stated that, like all other Zamindars, the Raja of Kharakpur had to preserve internal peace and order by maintaining sufficient Thanas or police establishments and to protect the tenants and other inhabitants from the incursions of lawless tribes from the neighbouring hills by providing or arranging for a suffi cient military force.
It could not be expected that a big Zamindar like the Raja of Kharakpur would render the police or military services personally and consequently it was natural for him to appoint his own Ghatwals to protect his Zamindari and to render services for him to the ruling power.
As said by Lord Kingsdown in Raja Lelanund Singh vs The Government of Bengal (supra) at p. 102 it was well established that long before 1765 the Zamindars of Kharakpur had created Ghatwali tenures for the purpose of protecting their Zamindaries from the attacks of mountaineers and other turbulent people in their neighborhood.
Lord Sumner in Narayan Singh vs Niranjan Chakravarti (supra) at p. 68 also recognised that long before 1765 Ghatwali tenures under the Zamindar of Kharakpur had been created by the various hold ers of those lands for their own purposes and as late as 1770 1785 Mr. Cleveland, who managed the estate during the minority of Kadir Ali, followed the same policy.
In Naray an Singh vs Niranjan Chakravarti (supra) at p. 50 Lord Sumner said : ""In the Sonthai Parganas there are for practical pur poses three classes of Ghatwali tenures: (a) Government ghatwalis created by the ruling power; (b) Government ghat walis, which since their creation and generally at the time of the Permanent Settlement have been included in a zamind ari estate and formed into a unit in the assessment; and (c) zamindari ghatwalis, created by the zamindar or his prede cessors and alienable with his consent.
The second of these classes is really a branch of the first.
"" The question, then, is to which class the Ghatwali tenure of Taluk Kakwara, with which we are concerned 10 74 in this case, belongs whether it was a Government Ghatwali or was one of the many Ghatwali tenures created by the Zamindars of Kharakpur.
Happily, we do not have to speculate.
The problem before us is not to infer the true nature and incidents of the original grant which could only be collected from the evi dence of what was done and left undone in connection with Taluk Kakwara by the ruling power and its officers.
We have in evidence before us the authentic texts of the two Sanads relating to the Kakwara Ghatwali and we also have the provi sions of the Permanent Settlement Regulation.
The nature and incidents of that tenure must rest upon the true construc tion and import of those grants as well as on the manner in which it was dealt with at the time of the Permanent Settle ment.
It will be convenient and useful, at this stage, to give a very short history of Mahalat Kharakpur and Taluk Kakwara.
In 1765 the East India Company secured the Dewani of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa from the Moghul Emperor.
The accession of Dewani was in effect a cession of the three provinces and the East India Company virtually became the sovereign ruling power over those territories.
At that time one Mozaffar Ali was the Raja of Mahalat Kharakpur.
Taluk Kakwara appertained to Mahalat Kharakpur.
In 1766 Raja Mozaffar Ali rose in rebellion against the East India Compa ny.
A strong military force under the command of Captain Browne was sent for quelling the revolt.
Eventually, in 1768 Raja Mozaffar Ali was subdued and imprisoned.
The Raja was deposed and deprived of his estate and the East India Compa ny took direct charge of Mahalat Kharakpur and managed it through its officers until the Mahalat was restored to Raja Kadir Ali, the grandson of Raja Mozaffar Ali.
In 1776 Cap tain Browne, who was then in charge of the Mahalat, granted an Amalnama or Sanad (Exhibit 1) in respect of 22 villages to two persons Rankoo Singh and Bhairo Singh at a fixed annual Jama of Rs, 245 12 15.
That Sanad was in the follow ing terms: 75 ""Seal of Captain James Browne, head of jungletari (low forest land).
Know ye, the present and future Mutasaddis of affairs, Chaudhuris, Kanungos, Zamindars and Ghatwals of Pargana Danda Sukhwara, Zila Jangal tari.
appertaining to Kharagpur, Sarkar Monghyr, in the Province of Bihar.
From the beginning of 1184 Fasli, Taluka Kakwara, parga na aforesaid, is let out in perpetual mukarrari, without any objection or contention, to Rankoo Singh and Bhairo Singh, ghatwals of the said Taluka, at a fixed jama of Rs. 245 12 15 (rupees two hundred and forty five, annas twelve and gandas fifteen) in current coins noted in the endorsement, consolidated from all sources, including malwajhat, sair wajhat and all grains, and excluding the perquisites of the zamindari, nankar, chaudhuris and kanungos, parganati ex penses, lands given in charity, e.g., barhmotar, shibotar and bishunparit lands, aima lands of jagirdars, bargandazes (musketeers), dhupars (?), mahus (?) etc.
It is requisite that they should peacefully cultivate (torn) and pay the Government (torn), according to the kabuliat, year after year and crop after crop, into the Government treasury.
They should make such effort as to increase the cultivation of the said Taluka from day to day.
They should hold them selves responsible for deficient cultivation.
They should keep the tenants pleased and contented with their good treatment and should not oppress any one and make excessive demands.
They should not fix the allowance of the jagirdars and bargandazes etc.
, over and above the rent.
They should bear this in mind.
They should provide for the protection of the tenants within their jurisdiction and of the villages of the said Taluka.

The amlas of the zamindars of the said Taluka should on knowing the said istimrari mukarrari rent to have been fixed, continue to receive the mukarrari rent from year to year and should not demand even a farthing in excess.
They should treat this as peremptory and act as written herein.

Fixed jama.
Rs. 245 12 15 gandas."" "" Then followed the specification of 22 Mouzas or villages.
It will be noticed that the grant was made to Rankoo Singh and Bhairo Singh described as ""ghatwals of the said Taluk"" which suggests that those two persons were already Ghatwals.
The duties generally imposed on the grantees and in particu lar the duty of providing protection for the tenants and of appearing before Huzur with his men did not, in the words of Lord Sumner in Narayan Singh vs Niranjan Chakravarti (supra) at p. 46, ""go beyond duties then ordinarily discharged by Zamindars.
"" There was no stipulation either in the main body of 77 the grant or in the endorsement at the foot for maintaining a regular body of a definite number of archers and barkan dazes such as is to be usually found in ordinary Ghatwali grants and indeed such as is in fact to be found in the subsequent grant of Raja Kadir Ali with respect to this very Taluk Kakwara.
Finally, the admonition at the end of the principal paragraph to the amlas of the Zamindars of the said Taluk to receive the fixed mukarrai rent and not to demand even a farthing in excess may well be regarded as indicating that the Zamindar was really interested in the grant.
In the premises, the observation of the learned Judges of the High Court of Calcutta in Munrunjun Singh vs Raja Lelanund (supra) at page 85 that the Sanad of Captain Browne seemed to them ""to be rather a confirmation of an existing tenure than the creation of a new one"" appears to have considerable force.
This view of the matter will be quite consistent with the subsequent history of the Kakwara Ghatwali which will be presently related.
It is, however, pointed out that at the date of this Sanad there was in fact no Raja of Karakpur and that as the Mahalat was being administered and managed by Captain Browne on behalf of the East India Company the grant made by him must be taken as creating a Government Ghatwali tenure.
The Seal at the top of the Sanad is said to indicate that in granting the Sanad in his capacity as Sardar of the Jungle Terai Captain Browne was acting for and on behalf of the East India Company.
The Sanad was addressed to the present and future Mutasaddis of affairs, Chaudhuris, Kanungos, Zamindars and Ghatwals of Pargana Danda Sukhwara and it is urged that if Captain Browne had been acting on behalf of the Zamindar of Kharakpur, addressing the Sanad to the Zamindars would have been wholly inappropriate.
The fact that the grant was to commence from the beginning of 1184 Fasli also militates against its being only a confirmation of a pre existing Ghatwali tenure.
The direction to pay according to the Kabuliat, year after year, crop after crop, into the Government treasury clearly suggests 78 that the Sanad created a Government Ghatwali tenure.
In the Moghul period there was no fixity of the jama and the grants were made annually and the jamas were liable to be varied.
The provision of a fixed annual jama in this Sanad cannot, therefore, it is argued, be regarded as a confirmation of an existing grant on a fixed jama.
Taking all these matters into consideration Shearer and Chatterjee JJ.
came to the conclusion that under Captain Browne 's Sanad of 1777 Taluk Kakwara became a Government Ghatwall.
This line of reasoning is not without force or cogency although it may not neces sarily be conclusive, for Captain Browne, undoubtedly acting for the East India Company, might well have issued the Sanad during the period of interregnum.
on behalf or in the inter est of whoever might eventually become the Zamindar of Kakwara.
If the matter rested only with this Sanad and nothing further had happened then perhaps it might have been said with some plausibility that a new tenure was created by the ruling power by this Sanad, but the matter does not in fact rest with only Captain Browne 's Sanad, and we have to see how this Taluk Kakwara has been subsequently dealt with and what effect the subsequent events have on the status and rights of the Ghatwal of this Taluk.
It appears that in 1780 the East India Company restored Mahalat Kharakpur to Kadir Ali, the grandson of the deposed Raja Mozaffar Ali.
Although the formal order of the Gover nor General came in 1781, the Mahalat was actually restored to Raja Kadir Ali in 1780.
At that time Raja Kadir Ali was only a boy of five or six years of age and Mr. Cleveland, the Collector of Bhagalpur, managed Mahalat Kharakpur for and on behalf of the minor Raja Kadir Ali.
On January 17, 1780, a fresh Sanad (Exhibit 1 (a)) was granted in the name and under the Seal of Raja Kadir All to the same two per sons, Rankoo Singh and Bhairo Singh, in the following terms : ""(Seat of Raja Qadir Ali, under Emperor Shah Alam, the Victorious 1193).

Of late also, (the said tenure) being upheld and kept intact as usual, according to the endorse ment, is assigned and granted with effect from the beginning of the Kharif season of 1189 Fasli Rajwara corresponding to 1188 Fasli Mughlana.
They should discharge the duties and obligations with honesty and fidelity and keep the tenants pleased and contented with their good treatment, and should watch the ghats and chaukis very carefully and cautiously, so that no thief and night robber may come around and about them.
If, God forbid, the properties of any one be stolen or plundered and cattle be concealed or murder be commited, they should trace the thieves and night robbers with the properties intact, restore the properties to the owner and produce the party of the mischief mongers before the Huzur and prove the murder.
In case they fail to find out the thieves and to prove the murder and the concealment (theft) of cattle, they should hold themselves responsible therefor.
They should continue to pay the quit rent to the Sarkar as usual.
When summoned, they should appear before the Huzur with the body of men.
It is desired that you should consider them as permanent Ghatwals of that place and maintain them in their possessions and you should not fail to give 'them sound advice so as to ensure by all means the advantage of the Sarkar and the well being of the tenants.

If Taluk Kakwara was, in its origin, a Zamindari Ghatwali created by the Zamindar of Kharakpur and if Captain Browne 's Sanad only confirmed that existing tenure during the inter regnum when he was in charge of the entire Mahalat of Kha rakpur and managed it on behalf of the East India Company but in the interest of whoever eventually became the Raja of Kharakpur, then on the restoration of the Zamindari to Raja Kadir Ali he would naturally clarify the position and status of the Ghatwals under him by issuing fresh Sanads in their favour.
In this view of the matter Raja Kadir Ali 's Sanad only regularised the original status of Taluk Kakwara as a Zamindari Ghatwali tenure and specified the terms more clearly and explicitly.","Taluk Kakwara was in its origin a Zemindari Ghatwali tenure and continued to be so, and was in fact treated as such ever since.
Even if by virtue of Captain Browne 's Sanad it became a Government Ghatwali tenure, then under the Sanad of Raja Kadir Ali or after the Permanent Settle ment at any rate, it became a Zemindari Ghatwali and as such alienable with the consent of the Zemindar according to the custom of Kharakpur judicially recognised [Nature and incidents of Ghatwali tenures discussed].

Appeal from the Judgment and Decree of the Bombay High Court (Chagla C.J. and Bhagwati J.) dated 6th Septem ber, 1949, in Appeal No. 16 of 1949, arising out of the Judgment dated ' 2nd February, 1949, of a Single Judge of the same High Court (Tendolkar J .) in Miscellaneous Application No. 223 of 1948.
The facts of the case and arguments of counsel are stated fully in the judgment.

N.C. Chatterjee (R. M. Hajarnavis, with him) for the respondent.
November 23.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.
The question here is whether an order should issue under section 45 of the Specific Relief Act against the appellant, who is the Commissioner of Police, Bombay.
The respondent, Gordhandas Bhanji, wanted to build a cinema house on a plot of land at Andheri in the year 1945.
At that date Andheri did not form a part of Bombay and under the.
rules then in force it was necessary to obtain permis sion from the District Magistrate of that area in the form of a No Objection Certificate.
Accordingly, the respondent made the necessary application on the 12th of September, 1945.
Permission.was refused on the 30th of September, 1945, on the ground that the public of the locality objected and also because there was already one cinema theatre at Andheri and so it was not necessary to have another ""for the present.
"" On the 1st of October, 1945, Andheri became a part of Greater Bombay and the jurisdiction to grant or refuse a license was transferred to the Commissioner of Police, Bombay.
The respondent accordingly put in a second applica tion on the 21st of November, 1945, and 138 addressed it to the Commissioner of Police.
After some correspondence this was also turned down on the 19th of March, 1946, ""owing to public opposition.
"" Nothing daunted, the respondent applied again on the 1st of April, 1946, and asked for a ""reopening"" of his case.
One of the grounds given was that ""The Government of Bombay are giving very careful atten tion and affording all reasonable facilities to develop the Greater Bombay into a model one.
A modern cinema, there fore, of the type I propose to build is indispensable.
"" In view of that, not unnaturally, the Commissioner of Police appears to have consulted the Government of Bombay, for he wrote to the respondent on the 25th of April, 1946, saying that ""the whole question of considering and approving sites for cinemas is under the consideration of the Government of Bombay,"" and he promised that ""when a decision is arrived at, your application will be examined.
"" It seems that somewhere about this time a Cinema Adviso ry Committee was constituted by Government.
We have not been enlightened about the scope and extent of its powers but it is evident from its nomenclature that its functions were purely advisory.
Five members of this Committee appear to have inspected the site on the 12th of May, 1947, and after prolonged discussion they reached the conclusion that ""in view of the location of four schools near by the site, this site is unsuitable for the purpose required and therefore it should be rejected.
"" A note was drawn up to that effect and the matter was ordered to be placed on the agenda of the next meeting of the Committee ""for final decision."" This final decision has not been placed on record but the Commissioner of Police tells us in his affidavit that within a month the Committee advised that the application should be granted.
Accordingly, the Commissioner accorded the necessary permission by his 139 letter dated the 14/16th of July, 1947.
There is no refer ence here to the recommendations of the Advisory co Commit tee and.
though they may have weighed, and rightly, with the Commissioner there is nothing on the face of the letter to indicate that the decision was not that of the Commis sioner himself given in bona fide exercise of the discretion vested in him.
We refer to this because the Commissioner has stated in his affidavit that I was fully satisfied that the petitioner 's application should be refused, but that it was only at the instance of the Cinema Advisory Committee that I granted the said per mission on the 14th of July, 1947.
"" That, however, would not affect the validity of his order.
There is no suggestion that his will was overborne or that there was dishonesty or fraud in what he did.
In the absence of that, he was entitled to take into consideration the advice thus tendered to him by a public body set up for this express purpose, and he was entitled in the bona fide exercise of his discretion to accept that advice and act upon it even though he would have acted differently if this important factor had not been present to his mind when he reached a decision.
The sanction accorded on the 16th of July, 1947, was therefore a good and valid sanction.
This sanction occasioned representations to Government presumably by the ""public"" who were opposing the scheme.
Anyway, the Commissioner wrote to the respondent on the 19/20th September, 1947, and direct him ""not to proceed with the construction of the cinema pending Government orders."" Shortly after, on the 27/30th September, 1947, the Commissioner sent the respondent the following communica tion: ""I am directed by Government to inform you that the permission to erect a cinema at the above site granted to you under this office letter. dated the 16th July, 1947, is hereby cancelled.
"" 140 It will be necessary at this stage to determine whether this was a cancellation by the Commissioner of on his own authority acting in the exercise of some power which was either vested in him or of which he bona fide believed himself to be possessed, or whether he merely acted as a post office in forwarding orders issued by some other au thority.
We have no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that this is not an order of cancellation by the Commission er but merely intimation by him of an order passed and made by another authority, namely the Government of Bombay.
An attempt was made by referring to the Commissioner 's affidavit to show that this was really an order of cancella tion made by him and that the order was his.order and not that of Government.
We are clear that public orders, public ly made, in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be construed in the light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the order of what he meant, or of what was in his mind, or what he intended to do.
Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect the acting and conduct of those to hum they are addressed and must be construed objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself.
Turning now to the language used, we are clear that by no stretch of imagination can this be construed to be an order which in effect says : ""I, so and so, by virtue of the authority vested in me, do hereby order and direct this and that.
"" If the Commissioner of Police had the power to cancel the license already grant ed and was the proper authority to make the order, it was incumbent on him to say so in express and direct terms.
Public authorities cannot play fast and loose with the powers vested in them, and persons to whose detriment orders are made are entitled to know with exactness and precision what they are expected to do or forbear from doing and exactly what authority is making the order.
141 But if there is ambiguity or doubt in the language used here a glance at the surrounding circumstances will dispel it.
What was the position at the time ? Permission was first refused and then granted, then suspended and the respondent was told to await, not the Commissioner 's orders, but those of Government.
Then comes the letter in question which conveys those orders.
So also there is the conduct of the Commissioner not long after.
The respondent 's solicitors placed the same construction on the order of the 30th Sep tember as we do and asked the Commissioner how Government could interfere with a permission granted by him.
They said on the 18th November 1947 : ""Our client has been advised that the authority to grant permission is in you acting in consultation with the Adviso ry Board.
It is difficult to understand how the Government can interfere with the permission granted by you."" The Commissioner 's reply dated 3/4th December, 1947, was: ""I write to inform you that permission granted to your client was cancelled under the orders of the Government who may be approached. "" We are clear that this roundabout language would not have been used if the order of cancellation had been that of the Commissioner.
We do not mean to suggest that it would have been improper for him to take into consideration the views and wishes of Government provided he did not surrender his own judgment and provided he made the order, but we hold on the material before us that the order of cancellation came from Government and that the Commissioner acted only as a transmitting agent.
It is next necessary to determine whether the Government of Bombay had the power to cancel a license once issued.
That depends on a consideration of the Rules.
They are framed under section 22 (1) (f) (i) (g) and (h) of the City of Bombay Police Act, 1902.
They regulate the ""licensing, controlling, keeping and regulation"" of places.
of public amusement in 19 142 the City of.
Bombay.
Rule 8 applies to any person desirous of ""erecting""a cinema, building.
There is, in our opinion, a distinction of principles between the erection and use of buildings for purely private and residential purposes and those intended to be used as places of public amusement.
Considerations arise regarding the latter which would not be applicable to the former, among them the right to withdraw or modify a license once issued.
Ordinarily, a man can do what he likes with his property subject of course to specific laws regulating his use of it, there fore in the case of a private residence he would in a general way have a right to build if he complies with all the rules and regulations and restrictions which may be imposed by law, and if permission is withheld when all the conditions are fulfilled he would normally have a right to demand that the necessary permission be given.
But that sort of consideration does not apply to a place intend ed to be used for public performances.
There, questions affecting the safety, convenience, morality and welfare of the public must be given overriding precedence and it is.usual in these cases, on grounds of public concern, to vest some public authority with a discretion to grant or refuse such licences and to modify or cancel ones already granted.
It is necessary to bear this distinction in mind when construing the present rules. 'Therefore, when Rule 8 speaks of ""erecting"" such premises, it must be borne in mind that the rule is not a mere building rule affecting the erection of a building in the abstract but applies to a building intended to be used for a particular purpose and the license applied for is not merely for permission to build but also to use structure, when erected, for a partic ular purpose affecting the public at large and the residents of the locality in particular.
Rule 8 falls under Part II which is headed : ""Preliminaries to obtaining license for premises.
"" These preliminaries include (a) the making of an application in writing to the Commis sioner of Police, and 143 (b)the giving of a certain notice as a preliminary to the application.
This notice has to be in the form prescribed in Schedule A and has to be maintained on a certain board ""until the application has been dealt with by the Com missioner"" and the rule prescribes that "" no application shall be considered before the expira tion of one fortnight after the receipt by the Commissioner of a copy of the notice etc.
"" Schedule A shows 'that the object of the notice is to enable the Commissioner to receive objections to the pro posed erection.
The rest of the rules in Part II specify the matters which the application shall contain and the documents which must accompany it including plans and specifications of the proposed building.
Part III prescribes various structural details with which the building must conform.
They include fire resist ing material for the roof, stage staircases and dressing rooms of a certain type, seating arrangements, Corridors, exits and so forth.
This part of the rules would apply to a building already in existence but not yet licensed for public performance as well as to one which has yet to be erected.
Part IV relates to the ""Use of cinematograph Apparatus and other optical Lan terns.
"" The rules prescribed there are mainly for purposes of health and safety.
Parts V and VI do not concern us.
They prescribe spe cial rules for Circuses and for exhibitions of Boxing and Wrestling.
Then comes Part VII which is material for present pur poses.
It is headed ""Licenses"".
Rule 237 prescribes that ""The person being the owner, tenant or occupier of such premises and the person who proposes to give any public performance, entertainment or exhibition on 144 such premises shall each take out a license under these rules"" Then follows a sub heading ""Licenses for Premises"" and under that come Rules 238 to 257.
Rule 23S prescribes that : ""No such premises shall be opened, or kept open for use as a place of public amusement unless the person being the owner, tenant or occupier thereof shall have obtained from the Commissioner the necessary license.
"" Rule 248 invests the Commissioner with ""absolute discretion in refusing any license etc. if such place appears to him likely to cause obstruction, inconvenience, annoyance, risk, danger or damage to resi dents or passers by in the vicinity of such premises.
"" Then follows Rule 250 which is crucial here.
It says : ""The commissioner shall have power in his absolute dis cretion at any time to cancel or suspend any license granted under these Rules. "" After Rule 257 comes a second sub heading entitled ""Per formance License"" and Rules 258 to 28:3 set out the require ments relating to the holding of performances as distinct from the requirements relating to the building or premises in or on which they are to be held.
The rest of the rules do not concern us.
It is clear to us from a perusal of these rules that the only person vested with authority to grant or refuse a license for the erection of a building to be used for pur poses of public amusement is the Commissioner of Police.
It is also clear that under Rule 250 he has been vested with the absolute discretion at any time to cancel or suspend any license which has been granted under the rules.
But the power to do so is vested in him and not in the State Govern ment and can only be exercised by him at his discretion.
No other person or authority can do it.
It was argued that Rule 250 did not apply to licenses to erect buildings but only referred to other matters 145 such as their maintenance and the kind of performances to be given in them.
We are unable to agree.
The preamble to the rules states that the Rules are for the ""licensing, controlling, keeping and regulation"" of places of public amusement in the City Bombay.
Part II which deals with the erection cinema houses nowhere autho rises the issue of a license but it does indicate that a license is necessary.
For instance, the heading states that the rules which follow in Part II are only the ""prelimi naries to obtaining license for premises"" and Rule 21 sets out that ""Before a license is granted. for such premises"" certain certificates must be produced.
All of which indi cates that a license is necessary.
But the only provision the actual issue of the license is in Part VII, and Rules 237 and 238 in that part require the owner, tenant or occu pier of premises intended to be used for a cinema house for public amusement to take out a license as well as for the person who proposes to give a public performance on such premises.
In our opinion, Rule 250 does authorise the can cellation of a license already issued but the only person who can effect the cancellation is the Commissioner of Police.
It was contended that this would work great hardship in some cases and that if money had already been expended on the building an estoppel at least would arise.
No question of estoppel has been raised here, so that is not a question we need consider nor need we answer the converse question whether an estoppel would hold good in the face of a law enacted for the public good on grounds of public policy; also whether there can be an estoppel when a person builds knowing the risk he runs of cancellation at any time under Rule 2S0.
The next question is whether an order in the nature of a mandamus can issue under section 45 of the Specific Relief Act.
It is necessary to emphasise that the present case does not fall either under article 32 (2) or article 226(1) of the Constitution.
We are confined here to section 45 of the Specific Relief Act.
146 The jurisdiction,conferred by.
that section is very spe cial in kind and is strictly limited in extent though the am but of the powers exercisable within those limited is wide.
Among the limitations imposed are the following: First, the order can only direct some specific act to be done or some specific ,act to be forborne.
It is not possible therefore to give a mere declaratory relief as under section 42.
Next, because of the proviso, the order can only be made if the doing or the for bearing is clearly recumbent upon the authority concerned under any law for the time being in force.
And thirdly, there must be no other specific and adequate legal remedies available to the applicant.
Now applying these rules to the present case, the appli cant must show what specific act he wants to.
be done or to be forborne.
That can only be gathered from the petition.
The reliefs specifically sought there are (1) an order directing the Commissioner to withdraw the cancellation and/or (2) directing him to grant permission for the erec tion of a cinema.
Taking the second.
first, it is evident from the rules that there is no specific law which requires the Commission er to grant a license on the fulfillment by the petitioner of certain conditions.
He is vested with a discretion to grant or to refuse a license and all that the law requires is that he should exercise that discretion in good faith.
But that he has done.
In the exercise of that discretion he granted a license and that license still holds good because, on the view we have taken, there has been no valid order of cancellation.
Accordingly, this relief cannot be granted.
Turning next to the first relief, that cannot be grant ed in the form in which it is sought because the rules vest the Commissioner with an absolute discretion to cancel at any time a license once granted.
There is no specific law which compels him to forbear from canceling a license once granted in fact that would be an impossibility; still less is there any law which compels him to withdraw a cancella tion already effected: that would fetter the absolute dis cretion 147 vested in him by Rule 250.
Therefore, this relief cannot be granted in the way it is asked for.
But we are of opinion that we are free to grant the respondent a modification of that relief in a different form.
It is to be observed that the petitioner did ask that he be granted ""such further and other relief as the nature and circumstances of the case may require.
"" We have held that the Commissioner did not in fact exercise his discretion in this case and did not cancel the license he granted.
He merely forwarded to the respondent an order of cancellation which another authority had pur ported to pass.
It is evident from these facts that the Commissioner had before him objections which called for the exercise of the discretion regarding cancellation specifi cally vested in him by Rule 250.
He was therefore bound to exercise it and bring to bear on the matter his own inde pendent and unfettered judgment and decide for himself whether to cancel the license or reject the objections.
That duty he can now be ordered to perform under section 45.
It was objected as to this that there is no specific law which compels him to exercise the discretion.
Rule 250 merely vests a discretion in him but does not require him to exercise it.
That is easily met by the observations of Earl Cairns L.C. in the House of Lords in Julius vs Lord Bishop of Oxford(i), observations which have our full and respect ful concurrence : ""There may be something in the nature of the thing empowered to be done, something in the object for which it is to be done, something in the conditions under which it is to be done, something in the title of the person or persons for whose benefit the power is to be exercised, which may couple the power with a duty, and make it the duty of the person in whom the power is reposed, to exercise that power when called upon to do so.
"" The discretion vested in the Commissioner of Police under Rule 250 has been conferred upon him for public rea sons involving the convenience, safety, (1) 5 App.
214 at 222, 223.
148 morality and welfare.
of the public at large.
An ena bling power of this kind conferred for public reasons and for the public benefit is, in our opinion, coupled with a duty to exercise it when the circumstances so demand.
It is a duty which cannot be shirked or shelved nor can it be evaded; performance of it can be compelled under section 45.
It was then objected that performance cannot be com pelled for another reason.
Section 45, it was said, is limited to duties which must be performed or forborne ""under any law for the time being in force,"" and it was argued that this means statute law.
There is authority for this point of view, but we see no reason for limiting the clear words of the section or for reading into it matter which is not there.
The provision is a beneficent one to compel the performance of public duties by public officers.
It is intended to open up a swift and summary remedy to the subject against, on the one hand, certain kinds of abuse or excesses on the part of public officers or, on the other, of laziness, incompetence, inertia or inaction on their part.
We can see no reason why statutory duties should be placed on any different plane from other duties enjoined by any other kind of law, especially as some.
statutory duties are slight or trivial when compared to certain other kinds of duties which are not referable to a statutory provision.
In our opinion, the words ""any law"" are wide enough to embrace all kinds of law and we so hold.
The only other point we need consider is whether ""the applicant has no other specific and adequate legal remedy.
"" It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the re spondent could have ignored the so called order of cancella tion if he considered it was of no effect; alternatively, he had the specific legal remedy of suing for an injunction which could have accorded him adequate relief.
In our opinion.
the first is neither a specific nor an adequate legal remedy.
Here is an order purporting to 149 emanate from the State Government itself served on the respondent by a responsible public officer.
Whether, the order is his order or an order of the State Government it is obviously one which primarily compels obedience as a matter of prudence and precaution.
It may in the end prove to be ineffective, as has happened in this case, but it would be wrong to expect a person on whom it is served to ignore it at his peril however much he may be legally entitled to do so.
Also, the very fact that this order was served on him, especially when it followed on the Commissioner 's letter of the 19/20th September, 1947, indicated that objections of a serious nature which it was the Commissioner 's duty to consider had been raised.
The respondent had a right to expect the Commissioner to make up his mind and reach a decision, otherwise it left him in a state of uncertainty.
If he commenced to build, the Commissioner would have a right to take action under Rule 250 and tell him to stop, and at best that would involve the respondent in a long and expensive litigation which he might or might not win.
We are clear that he had a right to be told definitely by the proper legal authority exactly what he might or might not do, so that he could adjust his affairs.
We are clear that the dangerous course of ignoring an official order at one 's peril is not the kind of adequate and specific legal remedy contemplated by section 45.
Next, as regards the relief of injunction.
We do not say that would not be a proper and adequate remedy in certain cases.
Each case must necessarily depend on its own facts and we have no intention of laying down any hard and fast rule.
But we do not think that would be adequate to meet the exigencies of the present case.
In the first place, a suit, if lodged, would require notice under section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code as it would be a suit against a public officer in his official capacity, and that would at once import delay; so would the long drawn out procedure of civil litigation with its concomitant appeals.
In a commer cial undertaking of the kind we have here, inordinate delay might well spell ruin to the project.
Large sums of money have necessarily to be tied up 20 150 so long as the matter remains in abeyance, the prices of land and materials are constantly rising and there is in the vicinity a rival theater which is all the while acquiring reputation and goodwill, two undefinable but important considerations in commercial undertakings.
It is therefore desirable that questions of the kind we have here should be decided as soon as may be It may be that any one of those considerations taken separately might not be enough to fulfil this requirement of section 45, but considered cumu latively we are of opinion that the applicant has no other adequate remedy in tiffs case.
In any event, there are many cases of a similar nature in which section 45 has been applied without objection despite the fact that an injunc tion could have been sought.
We need only cite a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (A1cock, Ashdown & Co. vs Chief Revenue Authority, Bombay) (1) where Lord Phillimore says at page 233 : ""To argue that if the Legislature says that a public officer, even a revenue officer, shall do a thing, and he without cause or justification refuses to do that thing, yet the Specific Relief Act would not be applicable, and there would be no power in the Court to compel him to give relief to the subject, is to state a proposition to which their Lordships must refuse assent."" Their Lordships then issued an order under section 45.
Lastly, it was urged that the petition is incompetent because the provisions of section 46 of the Specific Relief Act have not been complied with, namely, the petitioner has not shown that he made a demand for justice and that it was denied.
The demand and denial which section 46 requires are matters of substance and not of form.
In our opinion, there was a substantial demand here and it is clear that there was a denial.
Soon after the order of cancellation was intimat ed to the petitioner he instructed his solicitors to write to the Commissioner and enquire (1) 50 I.A. 227 at 233.
151 why the permission granted had been so arbitrarily can celled.
This was on the 18th November, 1947.
The reply dated 3/4th December, 1947, was that the cancellation was under the orders of Government and that they should be approached in the matter.
Government was approached.
The petitioner 's solicitors wrote to the Home Minister on the 9th December, 1947, and said : ""Our client has not been informed of any reasons which had moved the Government to direct the cancellation of the permission.
Our client was really entitled to be heard in the matter.
Our client desires to present his case before you and he shall feel obliged if you give him an interview. "" The Secretary to the Home Department replied on the 12th of January, 1948, that the Commissioner was directed to cancel the permission in view of numerous protests which Government received.
This was replied to on the 16th of February, 1948, and the petitioner 's solicitors said : ""Our client feels that he has not been treated fairly and that justice has been denied to him."" The only reply to this was : ""I am directed to inform you that Government does not wish to add anything to the reply already given to you."" The correspondence read as a whole contains a clear demand for justice and a denial.
It is true the actual demand was not made to the Commissioner nor was the denial by him but he clearly washed his hands of the matter by his letter of the 3rd/4th December, 1947, and referred the petitioner to Government under whose orders he said he was acting.
The demand made to Government and the denial by them were therefore in substance a demand made to the Commission er and a denial by him.
In any event, an evasion or shelving,of a demand for justice is sufficient to operate as a denial within the meaning of section 46.
In England the refusal need not be in so many words All that is necessary is to 152 show that the party complained of has distinctly deter mined not to do what.
is demanded (See 9 Halsbuy 's Laws of Eng land, Hailsham edition, page 772).
And in the United States of America a demand is not required ""where it is manifest it would be but an idle ceremony"" (See Ferris on Extraordinary Legal Remedies, page 281).
The law in India is not differ ent except that there must be a demand and a denial in substance though neither need be made in so many words The requirements of section 46 were therefore fulfilled.
The result is that in substance"" the appeal fails though it will be necessary to effect a modification of the High Court 's order.
The High Court directed the Commissioner of police to ""Withdraw the order of cancellation passed by him.
"" We have held that he did not make the order and that even if he did, a direction of that sort would not lie because of the discretion vested in him by Rule 250.
The following will accordingly be substituted for what the High Court has ordered: The Commissioner of Police be directed to consider the requests made to him for cancellation of the license sanc tioned by his letter dated the 14/16th of July, 1947, and, after weighing all the different aspects of the matter, and after bringing to bear his own unlettered judgment on the subject, himself to issue a definite and unambiguous order either canceling or refusing to cancel the said license in the exercise of the absolute discretion vested in him by Rule 250 of the Rules for Licensing and Controlling Theaters and Other Places of Public Amusement in Bombay City, 1914.
As the appeal fails except for the slight modification indicated above, the appellant will pay the respondent 's costs.
Decree modified.
","An application by the respondent for permission to build a cinema on a site within the City of Bombay was rejected by the Commissioner of Police, Bombay.
The respondent applied for reconsideration of his application and the Commissioner, acting on the advice of the Cinema Advisory Committee, granted the application on the 16th July, 1947, though he indicated in an affidavit flied later that but for this advice he would have refused the application again.
Subse quently, under instructions from Government the Commissioner sent the following communication to the respondent: ""I am directed by Government to inform you that the permission to erect a cinema at the above site granted to you under the office letter dated 16th July, 1947, is hereby canceled.
"" The respondent applied to the High Court of Bombay for an order under section 45 of the Specific Relief Act directing the Commissioner of Police, Bombay, to withdraw the cancellation and to grant permission for the erection of the cinema, and the High Court directed the Commissioner of Police ""to withdraw the order of cancellation passed by him."" The Commissioner of Police appealed to the Supreme Court.
Held, (i) that there was nothing in the letter dated 16th July, 1947, to indicate that the decision was not that of the Commissioner himself given in the bona fide exercise of the discretion vested in him.
The sanction was not conse quently invalid merely because the Commissioner decided to accept the advice of the Cinema Advisory Committee even though without that advice he would not have granted the permission.
(ii) There was no valid cancellation of the license because (a), the order of cancellation communicated to the respondent 'was one made by the Government of Bombay and not by the Commissioner on his own authority;he acted in the matter only as a transmitting agent; (b), under the rules framed under 136 section 22 (1) (f), (1) (g) and (n) of the City of Bombay Police Act 1902 the Government of Bombay had no power to cancel of license once issued.
The only person vested with authority to grant or refuse a license for the erection of a building to be used for purposes of public amusement is the Commissioner of Police.
(iii) The relief sought by the respondent of an injunction to direct the Commissioner of Police to grant permission for the erection of a cinema could not be granted because he had already granted permission and there was no valid order of cancellation.
(iv) The other relief asking for an injunction directing the commissioner to withdraw the cancellation also could not be granted because Rule 250 vests the Commissioner with an absolute discretion in the matter.
(v) Though there was no specific provision of law compel ling the Commissioner to exercise the discretion vested in him under Rule 250, inasmuch as the enabling power vested by Rule 250 was vested in the Commissioner for the welfare of the public at large it was coupled with a duty to exercise it when the circumstances so demanded.
The Commissioner could consequently be ordered under section 45 of the Specific Relief Act to exercise his discretion and decide whether the licence should or should not be cancelled.
(vi) The words ""any law"" in section 45 do not mean statutory law alone but embrace all kinds of law whether referable to a statutory provision or otherwise.
Therefore the perform ance of duties under the rules can be compelled under the provi sions of section 45.
(vii) There was no other specific and adequate legal remedy open to the respondent within the meaning of section 45 for though the respondent could have ignored the so called order of cancellation , he could only have done so.
at his peril as it purported to emanate from the State Government and was served by a public officer.
The remedy of injunction was not a proper and adequate remedy in the circumstances of the present case.
(viii) The petition was not incompetent under section 46 of the Specific Relief Act as there had been a demand of justice and a denial thereof within the meaning of the section in the circumstances of the case.
(ix) Public orders, publicly made, in exercise of a statu tory authority cannot be construed in the light of explana tions subsequently given by the officer making the order of what he meant or of what was in his mind, or what he intend ed to do.
As such orders are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect the acting and conduct of those to whom they are addressed ' they must be construed objec tively with reference to the language used in the order itself.

November26.
The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MUKHERJEA J.
This appeal is on behalf of the defendant and it arises out of a suit commenced by the plaintiff respondent, in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Chai bassa, for recovery of possession of the land described in schedule to the plaint, on the allegation that the defendant was a monthly tenant in respect of the same, and that the tenancy was determined by a notice to quit.
The suit was decreed by the trial court and the decision was affirmed, on appeal, by the District Judge, Purulia, and on Second Ap peal, by a Division Bench of the High Court of Patna.
The defendant has now come up to this court on the strength of a certificate granted under section 110, Civil Procedure Code.
Mr. Setalvad, appearing on behalf of the defendant appellant, stated to us at the outset that he would not dispute the validity or sufficiency of the notice to quit served upon his client, if on the facts of this case he is held to be a monthly tenant under the plaintiff in respect of the premises in suit.
His contention, in substance, is that the defendant was at no point of time a monthly tenant under the plaintiff or his predecessor.
There might have been, according to the learned Counsel, two tenancies for one year each for two successive periods, but on the expiry of the second yearly lease, which happened on 7th December, 1926, the defendant ceased to be a tenant and no fresh tenancy was created by holding over as is contemplated by section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act.
As there was no holding over, there could not be any question of a monthly tenancy being brought into existence 272 under the provision of section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act, and the present suit of the plaintiff having been admittedly brought more than 12 years after the deter mination of the second yearly lease, is barred by limitation under Article 139 of the Indian Limitation Act.
The whole controversy in this appeal thus centres round the point as to whether the defendant was in fact a monthly tenant under the plaintiff at the date when the notice to quit was served upon him.
To appreciate the respective contentions that have been put forward upon this point by the learned Counsel on both sides, it will be necessary to narrate briefly the material facts in their chronological order.
The property in suit is a plot of land, measuring 4 bighas 12 cuttas, and is comprised in old Survey plot No. 578 of village Jugselai in the district of Singhbhum.
The entire village forms part of the Dhalbhum estate, of which the plaintiff is admittedly the present proprietor.
One Charan Bhumiji was the "" Prodhan"" of village Jugselai from some time before 1913 and on 24th July, 1913, the father of the defendant, by a registered Patta, took a lease of about :31 bighas of land appertaining to Survey plot No. 573 from this Prodhan for purposes of cultivation.
It is not disput ed that the property in suit is covered by this Patta.
At that time the proprietor of the Dhalbhum estate was Raja Satrughna and he died in 1916, leaving behind him a will by which the entire estate was bequeathed to the present plain tiff.
The plaintiff 's claim under the will was challenged by one Partap Chandra Deo Dhabal who succeeded in getting his name recorded as proprietor of the zemindari in the Singhbhum Collectorate.
Thereupon the plaintiff instituted a suit (being Title Suit No. 67 of 1921) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Midnapore for establishment of his title to the zemindari and the suit was decreed by the trial Judge.
Against this decision, the defendant Pratap Chandra Deo Dhabal took an appeal to the High Court of Calcutta and during the pendency of this appeal, the High Court appointed a Receiver who was put in 273 possession of the entire estate.
On 8th December, 1924, the defendant executed a registered Kabuliyat in favour of the Receiver, by which he purported to take settlement of the land in suit for a period of 10 years at a rental of Rs. 46 per annum and a selami of Rs. 250.
There was a covenant in the lease, which looks like one for perpetual renewal, and it was to the effect that on the expiry of the term, if the lessor did not require the land for his own purposes and decided to re settle it, the lessee would be entitled to fresh settlement on enhanced,rent and on such terms as might be then agreed upon between the parties.
It appears from the record that the selami money, amounting to Rs. 250, was paid by the defendant to the Receiver several months before the Kabuliyat was executed, and the rental amounting to Rs. 46 was paid for the first time on 8th of March, 1925.
The next payment of rent was made in the succeeding year, on 16th of March, 1926.
Admittedly, no further payment of rent was made by the lessee either to the Receiver or to the proprietor since then, up to this period.
The High Court dismissed the appeal preferred by Pratap Chandra Deo Dhabal some time in 1924 and this order of dismissal was affirmed by the Judi cial Committee in May 1927.
The Receiver was then dis charged and the plaintiff got possession of the entire estate in July 1927.
On April 15, 1937, the plaintiff brought a suit for ejectment (being Title Suit No. 2 of 1937) against the defendant in respect of this property in the Court of the Subordinate Judge at Chaibassa.
The claim was based substantially upon the terms of the Kabuliyat executed by the defendant on 24th of December, 1924, and the suit was, in fact, one for ejectment of a lessee on the expiration of the period provided for in the lease.
It was only the renewal clause in the Kabuliyat that was challenged as invalid and inoperative, not only because it was vague and indefinite but also on the ground that the Receiver acted beyond his authority in entering into a stipulation of this character.
36 274 The defendant in his written statement resisted the plaintiff 's claim for possession primarily on the ground that he had acquired permanent rights in the land under the Prodhan 's Patta of 1913 and continuous occupation of it since then for more than 12 years.
The Kabuliyat of 1924, he attempted to ignore altogether.
It was said that it was executed only to avoid trouble and harassment at the hands of the Receiver and that, being inoperative as a lease, it could not, in any view, affect the prior rights which he acquired under the Patta of 1913.
The trial judge decreed the suit.
On appeal, the judg ment was reversed by the District Judge and the plaintiff 's suit was dismissed simply on the ground that the notice to quit that was served on the defendant was ineffectual in law to determine the tenancy.
The District Judge found, first of all, that the Prodhan 's Patta was void and inoperative in law and could not create any rights in the defendant, inas much as the Prodhan had no authority to settle lands of this character.
The Kabuliyat of 1924 was also held to be inef fectual as not amounting to a lease as defined by the Trans fer of Property Act.
It was held, however, by the District Judge that apart from the Kabuliyat, a tenancy was created by payment and acceptance of rent in the years 1925 and 1926 and after 1926 the defendant occupied the position of a monthly tenant by holding over under section 116 of the Transfer of Property Act.
Such tenancy could be determined by fifteen days ' notice, expiring with the month of tenancy, but as the notice, which was served by the plaintiff upon the defendant, did not fulfil this requirement, the plain tiff 's suit was bound to fail.
The District Judge, though he dismissed the suit, gave the plaintiff a declaration to the effect that the defendant was liable to eviction on service of fifteen days ' notice, expiring with the end of the Bengali month of the tenancy.
Against this decision, the plaintiff took an appeal to the High Court of Patna, and the appeal came up for hearing before Harries C.J. and Fazl Ali J.
The learned Judges affirmed the finding of the lower appellate court that 275 the Prodhan 's Patta did not create any rights in the defend ant and that the Kabuliyat of 1924 was also ineffectual as a lease to give the defendant any tenancy right.
The learned Judges further held that the defendant did not acquire any permanent right in the land by prescription or otherwise and that by reason of the payment of rent to the Receiver in the years 1925 and 1926 he became a tenant from month to month.
In these circumstances the High Court con curred with the District Judge in holding that the notice to quit was insufficient for the purpose of determining the tenancy.
It seems that the defendant made a strenuous endeavour before the High Court to establish that as the Patta of 1913 as well as the Kabuliyat of 1924 were both invalid and inoperative, he was never a tenant in respect of the land in suit and no tenancy could be created by the two payments of rent, inasmuch as the Receiver had no authority to receive them.
It was contended, therefore, that the plaintiff was in possession of the land as a trespasser all along and thus acquired a good title by adverse possession.
The High Court, though it held definitely that the defendant was a tenant from month to month, nevertheless kept open the question as to whether the payment of rent to the Receiver was tantamount to payment to the plaintiff.
It was held that as the notice to quit was defective, that was suffi cient for dismissal of the suit, and the declaration made in the decree of the lower appellate court that the defendant was liable to be evicted on service of fifteen days ' notice, expiring with the Bengali month of the tenancy, was directed to be deleted.
This judgment of the High Court was pro nounced on the 5th of May, 1942.
Soon after this on 18th July, 1942, the plaintiff served a notice to quit on the defendant, asking him to vacate the land on the 7th of August following, and as the defendant refused to give up possession, the present suit was brought on 22nd July, 1943.
The plaint in the present suit is a very simple one;it proceeds entirely on the findings record ed by the High Court in the previous litigation.
The right to 276 possession is not based on the terms of the Kabuliyat of 1024.
The plaintiff avers that by reason of the payment of rent on 8th March, 1925, and 16th March, 1926 the defendant became a tenant from month to month under him and the tenan cy was determined by a proper notice to quit.
The defendant in his written statement raised several pleas in answer to the plaintiff 's claim.
He reiterated his rights under the Patta of 1913 and urged that by reason of his holding possession of the land on assertion of a perma nent tenancy right for a long period of time, he acquired a valid title to the property.
As regards the Kabuliyat of 1924, it is said in one part of the written statement that the defendant executed this document under misapprehension of facts without knowing the contents thereof.
But at anoth er place it is stated that the Kabuliyat was binding on the plaintiff and he was not entitled to institute a suit in contravention of its terms, without in any event refunding the selami money.
The defendant admitted, what he denied in the earlier suit, that the payments made to the Receiver amounted to payments to the plaintiff himself, although this question was left open by the High Court on the previous occasion.
The other pleas raised in the written statement are not material, except that a specific point was taken, challenging the sufficiency of the notice to quit that was served upon the defendant.
On these pleadings a number of issues were framed.
The trial judge held on a consideration of the materials placed before him that the Prodhan 's Patta was a void and inopera tive document and conferred no rights on the defendant.
He negatived the case, which the defendant attempted to make in course of hearing, that the Kabuliyat executed by him was obtained by threat and coercion.
It was held by the Subordi nate Judge in accordance with the decisions of the Patna High Court on the point that the Kabuliyat could not operate as a lease under the Transfer of Property Act, and conse quently the defendant did not acquire the rights of a lessee under the same.
He held, however, 277 that by payment and acceptance of rent a new tenancy was created de hors the Kabuliyat, and as the new tenancy was for building purposes, it.
was a tenancy from month to month under section 106 Transfer of Property Act, terminable by fifteen days notice.
As the notice was proper and, suffi cient, the trial judge decreed the plaintiff 's suit.
Against this judgment, the defendant took an appeal to the court of the District Judge, Purulia, and the District Judge dismissed the appeal and affirmed the judgment of the trial court.
It appears that two points were raised by the defend ant before the District Judge in support of his appeal: one was that the Kabuliyat of 1924 was effective as a lease and consequently the defendant could not be ejected in contra vention of the terms thereof.
At the same time it was con tended that there was no tenancy at all held by the defend ant under the plaintiff, inasmuch as the payments made to the Receiver could not be regarded as payments to the plain tiff.
The first point, the District Judge pointed out, was contrary to the express decisions of the Patna High Court, while the second was contradictory to the defendant 's own admission in the written statement.
The defendant then came up in Second Appeal before the High Court of Patna and the appeal was heard by a Division Bench, consisting of Shearer and Reuben JJ.
The learned Judges agreed in dismissing the appeal and affirming the decree made by the courts below, but the grounds upon which they based their decision are not identical.
As regards the nature of the tenancy created by implication of law in consequence of the Receiver having accepted payment of rent from the defendant, it was held by Reuben J. that when the Receiver accepted rent in 1925, it should be presumed that the parties intended to create a tenancy for one year and when he accepted rent again in 1926, such acceptance amount ed to his assenting to the defendant 's holding over; and in view of the purpose for which the tenancy was created, the defendant from that time became a tenant from 278 month to month under the provision of section 116, Transfer of Property Act.
Shearer, J., felt difficulty in accepting this view though in his opinion if a periodic tenancy was created at all, it was from month to month and not from year to year.
There are observations, however, in the latter part of the judgment of Shearer, J., which would go to show that in his opinion the creation of two leases, each for one year, could be fairly gathered from the admitted facts of the case.
The learned Judge was not sure, however, as to whether the defendant ever became a tenant of the plaintiff.
He discussed the nature of the renewal clause contained in the Kabuliyat and held it to be void for uncertainty.
He also negatived the defendant 's plea on the strength of adverse possession.
His conclusion was that whatever view might be taken regarding these points, the defendant had no valid defence to the plaintiff 's claim for eviction and consequently the decision of the courts below was right.
It is the propriety of this decision that has been challenged before us in this appeal.
Mr. Setalvad, in support of his client 's case, has not called in aid the Prodhan 's Patta of 1913; nor has he placed any reliance upon the Kabuliyat of 1924 and the covenant for renewal contained therein.
He has not disputed before us that the payments made to the Receiver were in reality payments to the plaintiffs, and has conceded that a tenancy could be created by implication by reason of his client having paid and the Receiver having accepted rents in re spect of the suit premises.
His contention, as indicated already, is that by reason of the payment and acceptance of rent, there were two tenancies for one year each, creat ed for two successive years; but the relationship of landlord and tenant between the parties came to an end on the expiration of the second annual lease.
As there was no holding over by the defendant since then as contemplated by section 116, Transfer of Property Act, there was no subsist ing tenancy at any time after December, 1926, and the plain tiff 's suit instituted in the year 1943 was obviously time barred.
279 Mr. De, appearing for the plaintiff respondent, has, on the other hand, contended that the tenancy that was created by payment and acceptance of rent in the year 1925 was from the beginning a tenancy from month to month under the provi sion of section 106.
Transfer of Property Act.
Alterna tively, he has argued that if a tenancy for one year only was created in the year 1925, then after the expiration of that one year 's lease the defendant held over and the Receiver 's assent to his continuing in possession is evidenced by acceptance of rent from him in the year 1926.
The tenancy thus created would be a tenancy from month to month under section 116, Transfer of Property Act.
Lastly, it is argued that even if two successive tenancies were created for one year each, the facts admitted and proved would go to show that the tenant held over after the second annual lease and consequently a tenancy from month to month came into existence in accordance with the provision of section 116, Transfer of Property Act, even though no rent was demanded by the landlord after 1926.
The contro versy between the parties so far as this appeal is con cerned, therefore, narrows down to the following three points : (1) What was the nature of the tenancy created by ac ceptance of rent by the Receiver from the defendant on the 8th of March, 1925 ? If it was a tenancy from month to month, it is not disputed on behalf of the defendant that no question of holding over would at all arise and the plain tiff would be entitled to succeed.
(2) If in 1925 a tenancy was created for one year, can the landlord 's assent to the defendant 's continuing in possession be inferred from the fact that rent was accepted from the defendant in March, 1926 ? (3) If the payment and acceptance of rent in March, 1926, brought into existence a tenancy for another year, was there any subsequent tenancy created after the second year, although there was no ,demand or acceptance of rent by the landlord since then ? 280 So far as the first point is concerned, the courts below have proceeded on the view that a registered instru ment signed by the landlord was necessary to create.
a valid lease for ten years.
That view was not questioned before us and we express no opinion on this point.
Proceeding, there fore, on the assumption that even though the parties might have intended to create a lease for 10 years, no operative ]ease came into existence, the only facts admitted are that the defendant remained in possession of the land belonging to the plaintiff with the permission of the Receiver who represented the plaintiff 's estate, and paid rent to the latter.
From these facts a tenancy could be fairly presumed and the point for determination is, what was the duration of the tenancy that was created in the present case? Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act lays down: ""In the absence of a contract or local law or usage to the contrary a lease of immovable property for agricultural or manufacturing purposes shall be deemed to be a lease from year to year, terminable, on the part of either lessor or lessee, by six months ' notice expiring with the end of a year of the tenancy; and a lease of immovable property for any other purpose shall be deemed to be a lease from month to month, terminable, on the part of either lessor or les see, by fifteen days ' notice expiring with the end of a month of tenancy.
"" The section lays down a rule of construction which is to be applied when there is no period agreed upon between the parties.
In such cases the duration has to be determined by reference to the object or purpose for which the tenancy is created.
The rule of construction embodied in this sec tion applies not only to express leases of uncertain dura tion but also to leases implied by law which may be inferred from possession and acceptance of rent and other circum stances.
It is conceded that in the case before us the tenancy was not for manufacturing or agricultural purposes.
The object was to enable the lessee to build structures upon the land.
In these circumstances, it could be 281 regarded as a tenancy from month to month.
unless there was a contract to the contrary.
The question now is, whether there was a contract to the contrary in the present case ? Mr. Setalvad relies very strongly upon the fact that the rent paid here was an annual rent and he argues that from this fact it can fairly be inferred that the agreement between the parties was certainly not to create a monthly tenancy.
It is not disputed that the contract to the con trary, as contemplated by section 106 of the Transfer of.
Property Act, need not be an express contract; it may be implied, but it certainly should be a valid contract.
If it is no contract in law, the section will be operative and regulate the duration of the lease.
It has no doubt been recognised in several cases that the mode in which a rent is expressed to be payable affords a presumption that the tenancy is of a character corresponding there to.
Conse quently, when the rent reserved is an annual rent, the presumption would arise that the tenancy was an annual tenancy unless there is something to rebut the presumption.
But the difficulty in applying this rule to the present case arises from the fact that a tenancy from year to year or reserving a yearly rent can be made only by registered instrument, as laid down in section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act(1).
The Kabuliyat in the case before us is undoubtedly a registered instrument, but ex concessis it is not an operative document at all and cannot consequently fulfil the requirements of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act.
This position in fact is not seriously controverted by Mr. Setalvad; but what he argues is that a lease for one year certain might fairly be inferred from the payment of annual rent, and a stipulation like that would not come within the mischief of section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act.
His contention is that the payment of an annual rent, as was made in the present case, is totally inconsistent with a monthly lease.
We are not unmindful of the fact that in (1) Vide Debendra Nath vs Syama Prasanna, , 1126 37 282 certain reported cases, such inference has been drawn.
One such case has been referred to by Mr.Justice Reuben in his judgment(1), where reliance was placed upon an earlier decision of the Calcutta High CoUrt(3).
A similar view seems to have been taken also in Matilal vs Darjeeling Municipality(3).
But one serious objection to this view seems to be that this would amount to making a new contract for the parties.
The parties here certainly did not intend to create a lease for one year.
The lease was intended to be for a period exceeding one year, but as the intention was not expressed in the proper legal form, it could not be given effect to.
It is one thing to say that in the absence of a valid agreement, the rights of the parties would be regulat ed by law in the same manner as if no agreement existed at all; it is quite another thing to substitute a new agreement for the parties which is palpably contradicted by the admit ted facts of the case.
It would be pertinent to point out in tiffs connection that in the Second Appeal preferred by the plaintiff against the dismissal of his earlier suit by the lower appellate court, the High Court definitely held that the defendant 's tenancy was one from month to month under section 106, Transfer of Property Act, and the only question left open was whether payment to the Receiver amounted to payment to the plaintiff himself.
In this suit the defendant admitted in his written statement that payment to the Receiver had the same effect as payment to the plaintiff, and the trial judge took the same view as was taken by the High Court on the previous occasion, that by payment to and acceptance of rent by the Receiver, the defendant became a monthly tenant under section 106, Transfer of Property Act.
In his appeal before the District Judge, which was the last court of facts, the only ground upon which the defendant sought to challenge this finding of the trial judge was that the Receiver was an unauthorised person because of the 'decision of (1) Aziz Ahmad vs Alauddin Ahmad, A.I.R. 1933 Pat. 485.
(2) Md. Moosa vs Jaganund (3) 17 C.L.J. 167.
283 the Judicial Committee which set aside his appointment and consequently acceptance of rent by such person could not create a monthly tenancy.
This shows that it was not the case of the defendant at any stage of this suit that because one year 's rent was paid, a tenancy for one year was brought into existence.
We think, therefore, that on the facts of this case it would be quite proper to hold that the tenancy of the defendant was one from month to month since its inception in 1924.
This view finds support from a number of reported cases(1), and in all these cases the rent payable was a yearly rental.
On this finding no other question would arise and as the validity of the notice has not been questioned before us, the plaintiff would be enti tled to a decree in his favour.
The appeal thus fails and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
","The rule of construction embodied in section 106 of the Transfer Property Act applies not only to express leases of uncertain duration but also to leases implied by law which may be inferred from possession and acceptance of rent and other circumstances.
270 The contract to the contrary contemplated by the said sec tion need not be an express contract; it may be implied, but it should be a valid contract.
If the contract is invalid the section will regulate the duration of the lease.
When the rent reserved is an annual rent, a presump tion would arise that the tenancy was an annual tenancy unless there is something to rebut this presumption.
But under section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act a tenancy from year to year or reserving an yearly rent can be made only by a registered instrument.
The defendant executed a registered kabuliyat to the Receiver who was managing an estate pending a suit, purport ing to take a plot of land on lease for a period of ten years at a rental of Rs. 46 per annum and paid the first year 's rent of Rs. 46 on the 8th March, 1925, and the next year 's rent on the 16th March, 1926.
No further rent was paid by the defendant to the Receiver or to the proprietor after that date.
The proprietor, treating the defendant as a monthly tenant served notice to quit on him on the 18th July, 1942, asking the latter to vacate on the 7th August, 1942, and instituted a suit for ejectment in July, 1943.
The kabuliyat was found to be inoperative in law and the defend ant contended that the payment and acceptance of annual rent in 1925 and 1926 did not create a monthly tenancy but two tenancies for one year each for two successive years, that the relation of landlord and tenant came to an end on the expiration of the second annual lease, and, as there was no holding over, the suit was time barred: Held (i) that from the facts a tenancy could be pre sumed to have come into existence from 1924; (ii} as the purpose of the tenancy was for building structures on the land, under sec.
106 of the Transfer of Property Act the tenancy must be presumed to be one from month to month in the absence of a contract to the contrary; (iii) a contract that the tenancy was for one year certain could not be inferred in the present case from the fact that an annual rent was paid in 1925 and 1926, inasmuch as the kabuliyat, though inoperative in law, showed that the parties never intended to create a lease for one year; (iv) on the facts of the case it was quite proper to hold that the tenancy was one from month to month since its inception in 1924 and the suit was not time barred.

MAHAJAN J.
The question involved in the appeal relates to the right of succession to six Birbhum ghatwalis governed by Regulation XXIX of 1814, annexed to Gaddi Pathrol and lying within Tappasarath in the Santhal Parganas.
the genealogy of the contestants appears from the following pedigree table: .
Digbijoy Singh I Gurohari SinghKanhai Singh Bhairo Singh Balram Singh (Ghatwal) I I Pratar Singh I I I I I Banwari Singh Pitambar Katku Singh Bharat Singh (Died (Ghatwal) issueless) I Kharagdhari Singh (Ghatwal) I Ram Chandra Singh (Ghatwal) I I Brijbehari Singh Sarju Prasad Singh (Ghatwal) (Original plaintiff) I I Krishna Prasad Singh Hargobind Prasad Singh (Ghatwal) (Substituted plaintiff) I I Kali Prasad Singh Durga Prasad (Ghatwal) ( Died issueless) I Phaldani Kumari (Defendant) Tikait Kali Prasad Singh, the last gaddidar of Pathrol, died in the year 1935.
He belonged to the Baisi Chaurasi clan.
On the 29th November, 1935, the 155 Commissioner of Bhagalpur Division recognized Smt.
Phaldani Kumari as the next ghatwal and entitled to be maintained in possession of the ghatwali estate on the 30th November, 1936, sarju Prasad Singh brought the suit out of which this appeal arises in forma pauperis in the court of the Subor dinate Judge of Deoghar for possession of the ghatwalis.
In paragraphs 7, 8 and 10 of the plaint it was alleged that the ghatwalis in suit were joint family property and were im partible by custom; that succession to them was governed by the law of lineal primogeniture; that the females and persons claiming through them were altogether excluded from inheritance.
It was claimed that the late Tikait Kali Prasad Singh and the plaintiff were members of a joint Mitakshara family and that he alone as the eldest member of the eldest surviving line of the descendants of the common ancestor was entitled to succeed to them.
The defendant in her written statement denied this claim and contended that Birbhum ghatwalis governed by Regulation XXIX of 1814 are not and cannot be in the nature of joint family property but that the person who succeeds and holds the tenure as ghatwal is the sole proprietor and owner thereof.
It was pleaded that the properties being the exclusive and separate properties of the ghatwal for the time being, the defendant, his widow, was entitled to suc ceed to them in preference to the plaintiff under the Mitak shara school of Hindu law which admittedly governed the family of the parties.
The pleadings of the parties gave rise to the following issues : 1.
Whether succession to the ghatwalis in question is governed by the customs alleged in para 7 of the plaint ? 2.
Did the ghatwalis in question form joint family property of Kali Prasad Singh, his ancestors in the direct line and of Sarju Prasad Singh and the plaintiff? 3.
Did Kali Prasad die in a state of jointness with Sarju Prasad Singh ? 156 4.
Are the ghatwals the sole proprietors of the ghatwalis for the time being as alleged by the defendant ? 5.
Whether the plaintiff or the defendant is entitled to succeed to the properties in suit ? Issues 2, 3 and 4 were found by the trial Judge in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.
It was held that Kali Prasad Singh died in a state of jointness with Sarju Prasad Singh and that the ghatwalis in question were their joint family property and that the plaintiff the eldest surviving copartner in the eldest line of Digbijoy Singh 's descendants was entitled to succeed to them in preference to the widow.
It was common ground between the parties that in case the properties were held to be the separate properties of Kali Prasad Singh, the widow was entitled to succeed to them.
As a result of these findings the plaintiff 's suit was decreed with costs.
On appeal by the widow to the High Court, this.
decree was reversed and the plaintiff 's suit was dismissed with costs.
It was held that the character of the ghatwali tenures in question was such that they could not be regarded as joint property of the plaintiff and the last ghatwal and that being so, the defendant was entitled to succeed to them.
The learned counsel for the appellant based his argu ments on the thesis that the ghatwali estates in question were of the same nature and character as joint family im partible estates governed by the Mitakshara law and that the rule of survive applicable to such estates was also applicable to them.
It was contended that the High Court was in error in holding that the suit properties exclusively belonged to Kali Prasad Singh or that there was anything peculiar in these tenures which differentiated them from other ghatwalis in the Santhai Pargangs or from other im partible estates known to Hindu law and which peculiarity incapacitated them from being included within the definition of coparcenary property.
The plea that females were by custom excluded from inheriting ghatwali tenures in Birbhum was 157 dropped in the two courts below and was ' not raised before us; so also the point of custom set out in para.
7 of the plaint and covered by issue 1 was not seriously urged.
The learned Attorney General, while conceding that succession to these tenures was governed by the Mitakshara law, contended that in no sense could they be regarded as joint family property and that their peculiar characteris tics precluded the acquisition of any right by birth by members of a joint Hindu family in them.
He also urged in the alternative that the widow was 'entitled to succeed to them, assuming them to be joint family property under cus tom.
The courts below have given elaborate judgments in the case and reference has been made to a large number of decid ed cases.
In our opinion, the main point that needs decision is whether the suit ghatwalis were to be regarded as joint family or separate properties of the deceased.
For a solu tion of this problem it is necessary to refer first to the nature and main incidents of a ghatwali tenure.
Its origin is now well known.
In Moghul times grants of land were made to selected persons who were appointed guardians of the mountain passes for protecting the countryside against hill invaders and the office held by these persons bore the designation ""ghatwal"".
These grants were made in some cases directly by the ruling power and in other cases by the zamindar responsible by custom for the maintenance of secu rity and order within the estate as consideration for the performance of the duties.
By efflux of time these grants assumed the form of an actual estate in land, heritable and perpetual, but conditional upon services certain or services to be demanded.
Reference to some of the decided cases relating to Birbhum ghatwali tenures will sufficiently indicate their nature and character.
In Harlal Singh vs Joravan Singh(1), it was held that a ghatwali estate in Birbhum was not divisible (1) 6 Select.
Rep.204.
21 158 on the death of a ghatwal, amongst his heirs but should devolve entirely on the eldest son or the next ghatwal.
It was said that ghatwali lands are grants for particular pur poses, especially of police, and to divide them into small portions amongst the heirs of the ghatwals would defeat the very ends for which the grants were made.
In Satrukchunder Dey vs Bhagat Bharutchunder Singh(1), a decision of the year 1853, it was stated that the ghatwali tenures in Birbhum were not private property of the ghatwals but lands assigned by the State in remuneration for specific police services and were not alienable or attachable for personal debts.
Kustooree Koomaree vs Monohur Deo(2), Loch J. took the view that succession to ghatwalis is regulated by no rule of kulachar or family custom, nor by the Mitakshara law, but solely by the nature of the ghatwali tenure, which descends undivided to the party who succeeds to and holds the tenure as ghatwal and that a female is not incapable of holding a ghatwali tenure.
It was said that ""the party who succeeds to and holds the tenure as ghatwal must be, and has always been, looked upon as sole proprietor thereof, and, therefore, the other members of the family cannot claim to be coparceners and entitled to share in the profits of the property, though they may, by the permission and goodwill of the incumbent, derive their support, either from some portion of the property which he may have assigned to them, or directly from himself."" In Binode Ram Sein vs Deputy Commissioner of Santhai Pargangs(3), (on review it was held that the rents of a ghatwali tenure are not liable for the debts of the former deceased holder of the tenure.
The reason for the decision was that the tenure was held for the purpose of public services and those who perform the services are entitled to the whole of the remuneration.
(1) 9 S.D.R. 900.
(3) (2) 1864 W.R. (Gap Nos.) 39.
159 In Tekait Durga Pershad Singh vs Teketnee Durga Kuari(1), it was urged that a female 's right to inherit was inconsistent with a ghatwali estate.
This contention was negatived and reference was made to the fact that many ghatwali estates were held by females and it was observed that it was difficult to hold that a ghatwali estate must necessarily be held by male heirs.
This case further sug gests that in a case where it is held proved that the family was joint, succession to Birbhum ghatwali may be regulated by the same rule of Hindu law as is applicable to the devo lution of impartible estates.
In Ram Narain Singh vs Ramoon Paurey(2), another Birbhum ghatwali case, it was held that the ghatwal for the time being was only entitled to interest on the compensation money obtained for compulsory acquisition of a part of the ghatwali interest but that he could not spend the corpus of it which had to devolve on the next heir intact.
So far as Birbhum ghatwalis are concerned, it is only the above mentioned cases to which our attention was drawn.
Reference in this connection is also necessary to the terms of Regulation XXIX of 1814.
Sections I and II of the Regulation which are material to this enquiry are in these terms : I.
Whereas the lands held by the class of persons denom inated Ghautwauls, in the district of Beerbhoom, form a peculiar tenure to which the provisions of the existing Regulations are not expressly applicable; and whereas every ground exists to believe that, according to the former usages and constitution of the country, this class of per sons are entitled to hold their lands, generation after generation, in perpetuity, subject nevertheless to the payment of a fixed and established rent to the zemindar of Beerbhoom, and to the performance of certain duties for the maintenance of the public peace and support of the police; and whereas the rents payable by those tenants have been (1) (2) 160 recently adjusted, after a full and minute inquiry made by the proper officers in the revenue department; and whereas it is essential to give stability to the arrangements now established among the Ghautwauls, the following rules have been adopted, to be in force from the period of their pro mulgation in the district of Beerbhoom.
A settlement having lately been made on the part of the Government with the Ghautwauls in the district of Beerb hoom, it is hereby declared that they and their descendants in perpetuity shall be maintained in possession of the lands, so long as they shall respectively pay the revenue at present assessed upon them,. "" The result of the decided cases and of the provisions of the regulation is that the grantee of the tenure and his descendants have to be maintained in possession of the land from generation to generation conditional upon services to be rendered.
The tenure is however liable to forfeiture for misconduct or misbehavior of the ghatwal for the time being.
The succession to it is determined by the rule of lineal primogeniture.
It is neither partible nor alienable (except in exceptional cases with the consent of the government or the zamindar, as the case may be).
These two characteristics are inherent in its very nature and have not been annexed to it by any rule of custom.
The estate in the hands of the last holder is not liable either to attachment or sale in execution of a decree against him; nor is it liable in the hands of his successor for payment of his debts.
When the succession opens out, the heir determined according to law has to execute a muchilika in favour of the grantor guaranteeing the performance of the duties annexed to the office and stipulating that in case of misconduct or misbehaviour or non fulfilment of the obligations attaching to the office, as to which the tenure is in the nature of a remuneration, government will have the right to resume it.
In view of these peculiar characteristics of a ghatwali tenure in Birbhum which are so different from other inheri tances, we find it difficult to apply to it the 161 law of Mitakshara to the full extent.
The essence of a coparcenary under the Mitakshara law is unity of ownership.
As observed in Katama Natchir vs The Raja of Sivaganga(1), there has to be community of interest and unity of posses sion between all the, members of the family, and upon the death of any one of them the others may well take by survi vorship that in which they had during the deceased 's life time a common interest and a common possession.
The inci dents attaching to a Birbhum ghatwali tenure rule out the existence of any notion of community of interest and unity of possession of the members of the family with the holder for the time being.
He is entitled to be maintained in exclusive possession of the ghatwali lands and the devolu tion of the property is to him in the status of a sole heir.
This view finds support from the observations of Lord Fitz gerald in Kali Pershad vs Anand Roy(2), though made in respect of a zamindari ghatwali, yet also appositely ap plicable to a government ghatwali.
His Lordship observed as follows : ""Where, however, the Mitakshara governs, each son imme diately on his birth takes a share equal to his father in the ancestral immoveable estate.
Having regard to the origin and nature of ghatwali tenures and their purposes and inci dents as established by decided cases, most of which have been referred to in the course of the argument, it is admit ted that such a tenure is in some particulars distinct from, and cannot be governed by, either the general objects of Hindu inheritance as above stated, or by the before quoted rule of the Mitakshara.
It is admitted that a ghatwali estate is impartable that is to say, not subject to partition; that the eldest son succeeds to the whole to the exclusion of his brothers.
These are propositions that seem to exclude the application of the Mitakshara rule that the sons on birth each take an equal estate with the father and are entitled to partition.
"" Similar opinion was expressed in Chhalraclhari Singh vs Saraswati Kumari(3), by a Bench of the (1) (1861 3) 9 M.I.A. 543.
(3) Cal.
(2) Cal.
471. 162 Calcutta High Court.
The following passage from that a decision may be quoted with advantage : ""The learned pleader for the appellant has however con tended before us ,that, although this ghatwali tenure is impartible, yet according to the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Chintaman Singh vs Nowlukho Koon wari(1), it is not necessarily separate property, and that as their Lordships observe 'whether the general status of a Hindu family be joint or undivided, property which is joint will follow one and property which is separate will follow another course of succession. ' The decision referred to is no doubt an authority for the proposition that there may be impartible joint family property, such as a raj or other estate similar to a raj, but whether such property is to be regarded as joint or separate would appear to depend generally upon the character of the property at its incep tion, such as the nature of the grant, etc.
creating it.
Having regard however to the view we have already expressed as to the status of the family in the present case, and as to the ghatwali tenure having been the exclusive property of Ananta Narain, we think it is unnecessary to determine what was originally the character of this tenure, although, if we were called upon to decide the question, we should be disposed to say, with reference to the peculiar character of these tenures as described in Regulation XXIX of 1814, that they were intended to be the exclusive property of the ghatwalforthe time being, and not joint family property in the proper sense of the In Raja Durga Prashad Singh vs Tribeni Singh(2), again it was said as follows : ""It was certainly an advantage to the whole family that one of their members should hold the office and the tenure.
He could put other members of the family into minor offices and grant them subordinate interests commonly called jotes, and he could and would generally provide for the family in the manner (1) (2) (1918) 45 I.A. 251. 163 expected of its head.
But this is a long way off making him a trustee for the family or treating the ghatwali estate as possessed by the family and reducing the ghatwali to the position of karta or managing head of the family.
Their Lordships do not find that the incidents of ghatwali tenure are such as to give the family any rights over the property while it is in the hands of the ghatwal, and they find themselves upon this point in full agreement with the courts in India.
"" In Narayan Singh vs Niranjan Chakravarti(1), Lord Sumner made an exhaustive review of the decided cases and examined the whole position of ghatwali tenures generally and ob served that where the tenure is hereditary, a recognized right to be appointed ghatwal takes the place of a formal appointment and a recognized right in the superior to dis miss the ghatwal if he is no longer able and willing to render the service required by his tenure, and to appoint another to the office and the tenure of the lands, then readily suffices to maintain in perpetuity the incidents of the tenure.
In these circumstances it is not possible to hold that the Mitakshara rule that when a person inherits property from any one of his three immediate paternal ancestors, his sons, grandsons and great grandsons acquire an interest in it by birth can have any application to the case of these grants which are in the nature of a remuneration for the performance of certain services by the holder of that of fice.
A ghatwali has to be regarded as something connected with an office and as observed by Lord Sumner in the above mentioned case, the office cannot except by special custom, grant or other arrangement, either run with lands or be served from them.
In other words, just as primogeniture and impartibility are handmaids, similarly the ghatwal 's office and the ghatwali tenure are two inseparables and cannot be lodged in separate compartments.
If the office cannot be in the nature of coparcenary property, the tenure must follow the same way.
Thus it is not easy to conceive that an inter est (1) (1924) 51 I.A. 37.
164 can be acquired at the birth of a member of a joint family in a tenure which is annexed to an office, even if it has descended from three immediate paternal ancestors.
In certain eventualities the selection of the next heir depends on the choice of the ruling authority and in case of miscon duct or misbehaviour of the holder for the time being the ruling power can not only dismiss the ghatwal but even resume the tenure.
This is a feature which places this heritable property in a class by itself as distinguished from other inheritances governed by the Mitakshara law.
The view that in Birbhum, ghatwali tenures are in the nature of separate property or the exclusive property of the ghatwal finds support from the fact that in many instances, whenever succession has opened out in respect of them, it has been determined according to the Mitakshara rule ap plicable to the devolution of separate property irrespective of the circumstance whether the deceased died in joint or separate status with the other members of the family.
Thirteen instances of such practice in the past amongst members of the Bais Chaurasi clan were proved in the case, in all of which the widow succeeded in preference to a male heir.
The learned trial Judge held that in some of these instances the female succeeded because the agnate nearest in line was separate from her husband; as regards the others though he reached the conclusion that the evidence of sepa ration was weak, he thought that these did not establish a custom superseding in cases of joint family property the rule of survivorship.
The High Court was of a different opinion.
It rightly remarked that while numerous instances of female succession to the estates held by Baisi Chaurasi gaddidar 's had been proved, not a single instance of a female having been excluded from the appointment of a ghat wal on the ground of an agnate being entitled to come in as a coparcener of the last holder by survivorship had been proved, and that in these circumstances there was force in the contention that even if the tenures in question were ancestral joint family property, succession thereto was 165 governed by the Mitakshara rule applicable to separate property.
For the reasons given above we held that the Mitakshara rule that the property inherited by a person from his imme diate paternal ancestors becomes ancestral in his hands and in it his sons, grandsons and great grandsons acquire a right at the moment of the birth has no apposite application to Birbhum ghatwali tenures.
The learned counsel for the appellant in support of his contention placed reliance on a number of decisions of their Lordships of the Privy Council concerning impartible estates governed by the Mitakshara law, wherein it was held that the succession to an impartible estate which is the ancestral property of a joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara law is governed by the rule of survivorship subject to the custom of impartibility; the eldest member of the senior branch of the family succeeding in preference to the direct lineal senior descendants of the common ancestor, if the latter is more remote in degree.
Particular reference was made to the remarks of Turner L. I. in the Sivaganga case(1), and to the observations in Baijnath Prasad Singh vs Tej Bali Singh (2) and in the case of Shiba Prasad Singh vs Rani Prayag Kumari Debi(3).
Therein it was said that in the case of ordinary joint family property the members Of the family have (1) the right of partition, (2) the right to restrain alienations by the head, (3) the right of mainte nance, and (4) the right of survivorship.
The first of these rights cannot exist in the case of an impartible estate, though ancestral, from the very nature of the estate.
The second and third are incompatible with the custom of impart ibility.
To this extent the general law of the Mitakshara has been superseded by custom and the impartible estate, though ancestral, is clothed with the incidents of self acquired and separate property.
But the right of survivor ship is not inconsistent with the custom of impartibility.
This right (1) (1861 3) 9 M.I.A. 543.
(3) A.I.R. 1932 P.C. 216.
(2) All.
22 166 therefore still remains and to this extent the estate still retain.s its character of joint family property and its devolution is governed by the general Mitakshara law applicable to such property and that though the other rights which a coparcener acquires by birth in joint family proper ty no longer exist, the birthright of the senior member to take by survivorship still remains.
In our view, these observations have no application to the tenures in suit.
As already indicated, it is not possi ble to concede in their case that a member of a joint family governed by the Mitakshara law acquires any right by birth in them.
The general law of Mitakshara creating that right seems to have been superseded in their case not only by peculiarities inherent in the nature of these tenures but by encroachments of custom on it.
Moreover, it appears that the remarks relied upon were made in cases where the impartible estates were admittedly joint family property or the grants were of such a character that they are intended for the benefit of the family as such.
The ratio of these decisions was that even though certain incidents attaching to joint family property may cease to exist by custom, some others which are not affected by custom may survive.
This reasoning can have no application to property which at no stage what ever could be clothed or was clothed with any of the inci dents of coparcenary property.
The learned counsel for the appellant placed considera ble reliance on the observations of Sir Dawson Miller C.J. in Fulbati Kumari vs Maheshwari Prasad(1).
The learned Chief Justice therein dissented from the View urged before him that all ghatwali property is the exclusive separate property of the holder for the time being and that it de volves according to the rules affecting separate property subject again to the circumstance of impartibility.
He observed that the fact that a raj is impartible does not in a case governed by the Mitakshara law make it separate or self acquired property, that it may be self acquired (1) A. I. R. 1923 Pat.
167 property or it may be the property of a joint undivided family and that in the latter case succession will be regu lated according to the rule of survivorship.
In our opinion, these observations have no application to the case of Birb hum ghatwalis because in express terms these were excluded from consideration in that case.
In the judgment it was said : ""In our opinion, the estate in the present case is in no way comparable to the Birbhum ghatwali tenures and Regula tion XXIX of 1814 does not apply to it."" The decision in the case proceeded on the assumption that Birbhum ghatwalis stood apart from other ghatwalis which stood on the same footing as impartible estates gov erned by Mitakshara law.
The learned Attorney General challenged the correctness of these decisions and contended that the decisions of the Privy Council on this subject were not uniform.
He drew our attention to the observations made in Sartaj Kuari 's case(1), in the Second Pittapur case(2), and in Tipperah case(3).
There may be a seeming conflict between the view expressed in those decisions and the view expressed in Baijnath Prasad Singh vs Tej Bali Singh(4), and in Shiba Prasad Singh vs Rani Prayag Kurnari Debi(5).
It seems to us however that these latter cases have settled the law ap plicable to joint family impartible estates governed by Mitakshara law and it is rather late in the day to reopen a controversy settled by a series of decisions of the Privy Council.
The contention that on the death of the last holder a ghatwali tenure in Birbhum reverts to the grantor and that notionally there is a resumption of it in favour of govern ment and a re grant to the next heir does not impress us.
On the express terms of the regulation these tenures are heritable from generation to generation and the theory of resumption and re grant is inconsistent with their heritable character.
Inheritance can never remain in abeyance and on the (1) (4) All.
(2) (1918) 45 I.A. 148.
(5) A.I.R. 1932 P.C. 216.
(3) (1867 9) 12 M.I.A. 523.
168 death of the last holder the estate immediately vests in the next heir.
The circumstance that the government may in certain events have the power to dismiss a ghatwal or to forfeit the tenure cannot lead to the inference that it terminates and is re granted at every death.
The argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that a widow not being a descendant of the grantee under the terms of Regulation XXIX of 1814, is not entitled to inherit to Birbhum ghatwali tenures also does not impress us.
The regulation does not enact any rule of succession to these tenures, and the devolution with respect to them is admit tedly determined by personal law or custom.
The expression ""descendants"" used in the regulation cannot deprive females, like a widow or a mother, from taking the inheritance where they are legal heirs under Mitakshara law or under custom.
Females have invariably been allowed to succeed to these tenures in the past.
The appellant 's counsel conceded that if the property was the separate property of Kali Prasad Singh, the defendant was entitled to inherit to it.
We think that the expression ""descendants"" has been loosely employed in the regulation for the word ""heirs"".
On this point we are in agreement with the observations made by a Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Chhatradhari Singh vs Saraswyati Kumari(1).
It may further be pointed out that even if the conten tion of the learned counsel for the appellant is to be accepted, by no process could the trial court have passed a decree in favour of the plaintiff in respect of items 4, 5 and 6 of the schedule Admittedly these were acquired by Krishna Prasad Singh, father of Kali Prasad Singh by a decree of court passed in his favour against his collateral Katku Singh who also claimed these properties as an heir to the last male owner Banwari Singh (vide Exhibit 4).
These pro perties having devolved upon Krishna Prasad Singh by obstructed heritage, were in the nature of separate property in his hands and could not fall within the (1) Cal.
156. 169 definition of ancestral property given in Mitakshara.
Sarju Prasad Singh, uncle of Krishna Prasad Singh, could acquire no right or roterest in these properties by birth enabling him to claim them by survivorship.
Kali Prasad Singh who inherited them on the death of his father got them as his separate property as he had no son who could acquire any interest in them by birth.
With regard to this property the widow was certainly an heir after the death of her husband ' and plaintiff could have no claim whatsoever in respect of these items of the schedule.
This aspect of the case seems to have been lost sight of in the two courts below.
The result, therefore, is that this appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
FAZL ALI J.
While agreeing generally with my learned brother Mahajan J., I wish to say a few words to indicate the main ground on which I would dismiss this appeal.
There are a number of authoritative decisions dealing with the special features of ghatwali property, one of which is said to be that if the ghatwal is a member of a joint family, the family has no right over the property while it is in his hands.
[See Durga Prashad Singh vs Tribeni Singh(1)].
The logical corollary from this characteristic of ghatwali property would seem to be that it is more in the nature of exclusive property of the ghatwal than of joint family property.
Nevertheless, in some cases, succession to such property has been determined with reference to the rules of Hindu law regarding joint property, where the ghatwal was found to be a member of the joint family.
As at present advised I am not prepared to say that those cases were wrongly decided, but I think it will not be incorrect to say that custom and usage are also important factors governing succession to ghatwali property, and it is con ceivable that while in some cases custom may develop on the lines of Hindu law relating to succession owing to repeated instances of (1) (1918) 45 I.A. 251. 170 tacit and unquestioned application of the law, in other i.a cases succession to ghatwali property may be governed not entirely by Hindu law but by such law as modified in certain respects by usage and custom.
The question with which we are concerned in this case is whether the widow of a deceased ghatwal, who was a member of a joint family and died leaving no issue or direct male descendants, can succeed to the ghatWali property in prefer ence to the nearest male agnate.
On a reference to the plaint, it would appear that what the plaintiff contended was that the clan to which the parties belong was governed by the Mitakshara school of Hindu law ""subject to their clan custom"", one of which was said to be t","Held by the Full Court Amongst the Birbhum ghatwals, when the holder of a ghatwali dies leaving a widow but no direct lineal descendants, the widow succeeds in prefer ence to the nearest male agnate, even though the family may be a joint family.
Per MAHAJAN and Bose JJ.
The Mitakshara rule that the property inherited by a person from his immediate paternal ancestors becomes ancestral in his hands, and his sons, grandsons and great grandsons acquire a right in it at the moment of their birth has no application to Birbhum ghatwali tenures.
The word ""descendants"" is used in Regulation XXIX of 1814 loosely in the sense of ""heirs"" and does not mean lineal descendants.
FAZL ALI J. Custom and usage are important factors governing succession to ghatwali property, and while in some cases custom may develop on the lines of Hind law relating to succession 0wing to repeated instances of tacit and unquestioned application of the law, in other cases succes sion to ghatwali property may be governed not entirely by Hindu law but by such law as modified in certain respects by usage and custom.

October 25.
the Judgment of the Court was delivered by KANIA C.J.
These are five companion appeals from the judgment of the High Court at Orissa, delivered on five petitions filed by the respondent in each of the appeals, to obtain from the Court a writ of mandamus and/or directions under article 226 of 'the Constitution of India.
Each of the respondents alleged that between 1941 and 1947 he had agreed to take from the Ruler of Keonjhar a mining lease and had entered into possession of the area.
Some of the petitioners alleged that they had spent money on the development of the mines and installed machinery to work the same.
It is however common ground that there was no registered lease in favour of any of the respondents before 1947.
On the 14th December, 1947, the Ruler of Keonjhar entered into a merger agreement with the Dominion of India and as from the 1st January, 1948, the State was merged in the Dominion of India.
After signing the merger agreement the Ruler gave registered 30 leases on the 27th December, 1947, to the respondents in these appeals.
In pursuance of the exercise of the powers conferred on the Government of Orissa by section 4 of the Extra Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1949, read with Notifica tion No. 172/1B dated 23rd March, 1948, of the Government of India, the Government of Orissa issued a notification dated the 8th of June, 1949, declaring, inter alia, the said leases to be void and not binding on it.
This annulment was made expressly on the ground that these commitments were not reasonable and bona fide.
Thereafter, the respondents, along with others approached the Orissa Government to give them leases and the State Government gave them temporary permits to work the mines in November, 1949.
On the 3rd July, 1951, however they passed an order cancelling the temporary per mits and directed the respondents to remove their assets appertaining to the respective mines within a fortnight.
The respondents thereupon filed the petitions before the Orissa High Court praying for writs or directions in the nature of mandamus against the State of Orissa directing them to withdraw the notices dated the 8th of June and 3rd of July, 1951, and to forbear from acting upon or giving effect to the same.
The Court, after noticing the rival contentions of the parties and rejecting the contention that the State of Orissa had cancelled the permits and were attempting to take possession as an act of State, posed the question ""whether the law of annulment relied upon by the State was applicable to the mining leases granted to the petitioners, or in the alternative, whether the State had any right in law to cancel the leases before the period mentioned therein.
"" Referring to the contention of the State rounded on the acceptance by the respondents of the temporary permits and the estoppel arising therefrom, Ray C.J. in his judgment stated as follows : ""In determining the validity of this contention (relating to the temporary permit and estoppel arising therefrom) the circumstances under which these applications were made and the legal implications of such applications and the permissions granted under 31 them will have to be considered.
It is remote from our intention to express any opinion in this summary proceeding as to the respective merits of the rival contentions.
I am however satisfied that in the context of events and in the logic of circumstances attending thereto there is a case to be tried.
"" He next considered the scope of the writ of mandamus and came to the conclusion that ""at the moment"" the respondents had no alternative legal remedy, equally conven ient, beneficial and effectual because the respondents could not file a suit till after the expiry of the period of sixty days required for the purpose under section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code and he thought that unless protected by the Court in the meanwhile the respondents would undergo irrepa rable and irremediable loss of possession of the mining leases involving a huge waste of labour, machinery and other resources of equipments of immense value hardly capable of being remedied by payments of money as compensation.
The Bench therefore passed an order dated 2nd August, 1951, as follows : ""We direct that till three months from today or one week after the institution of their (respondents ') contemplated suit, whichever is earlier, the Government of the State of Orissa should refrain from disturbing the petitioners ' possession over the mining areas in question and that thereafter this order will cease to have effect.
"" They gave further directions as to how the mines were to be worked during the aforesaid period.
Towards the end of the judgment it was stated, ""In the result, the petitions are allowed in part to the limited extent indicated above."" Narasimham J. agreed with the order set out in the judgment of the Chief Justice although his judgment shows the concur rence to be very halting.
He stated that although he was reluctant to exercise the powers under article 226 because the present respondents could file a suit, yet as in view of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code there would be an unavoidable delay resulting in irreparable loss to the respondents he agreed that the order should be passed as mentioned in the judgment of the Chief Justice, 32 Towards the end of his judgment he stated as follows: ""It should however be clearly emphasized that the observations contained in this judgment should not be taken as pre judg ing any question which may.arise for the consideration of the Civil Court in the event of the petitioners filing a regular suit and seeking interim relief from that Court by way of temporary injunction, appointment of receiver or otherwise.
If such an application is made, the questions as to whether the petitioners have a prima facie case for trial or whether such a suit is maintainable or whether the bal ance of convenience requires that they should be permitted to remain in possession of the leasehold property till the termination of the suit and other allied matters should all be dealt with by the Court concerned without being influ enced in any way by the observations contained in this judgment.
Those observations have been made for the limited purpose of granting temporary relief under article 226 and are not intended to embarrass either party or the Court in future litigation.
"" It appears that thereafter an application was made to stay the operation of this order to enable the Government of Orissa to appeal against the order of the 2nd of August.
The same Judges on the 6th of August stayed the operation of the order for fifteen days and observed as follows : ""The effect of the order (of 2nd August, 1951) is that except giving them (respondents in these appeals) some interim measure of relief for the period during which the petition ers were without remedy, we were not inclined to accept the petition and issue a writ in the nature of mandamus, as prayed for.
"" The State of Orissa has come on appeal to us and after hearing the arguments on both sides we came to the conclusion that the order of the High Court could not be sustained.
We accordingly passed the following order on the 15th of October: ""These five appeals are allowed and the order of the High Court is set aside in each case.
As the High Court has passed no other orders on the petitions.
and indeed has stated that the Court was not prepared to 33 pass any ,other orders on the petitions, the petitions stand dismissed.
The respondents will pay the costs of the ap peals.
We shall give our reasons later on.
"" Our reasons are these: Article ,226 of the Constitution of India runs as fol lows: 226.
(1)""Notwithstanding anything in article 32, every High Court shall have power, throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases any Government, within those territories directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari, or any of them, for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose.
(2) The power conferred on a High Court by clause (1) shall not be in derogation of the power conferred on the Supreme Court by clause (2) of article The language of the Article shows that the issuing of writs or directions by the Court is not rounded only on its decision that a right of the aggrieved party under Part II1 of the Constitution (Fundamental Rights) has been in fringed.
It can also issue writs or give similar directions for any other purpose.
The concluding words of article 226 have to be read in the context of what precedes the same.
Therefore the existence of the right is the foundation of the exercise of jurisdiction of the Court under this Arti cle.
The judgment of the Orissa High Court under appeal, however, shows that the Judges have decided nothing at all in respect of the rights of the parties.
Indeed they have expressly stated that their observations should not in any way be considered as deciding any of the rights or conten tions of the parties raised in the petitions.
The whole judgment shows that because of the requirement of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code the present respondents could not file a suit against the Government for at least sixty days, the 5 34 respondent 's position should not in the interval be dis turbed and accordingly the Court gave the directions in its order of the 2nd of August, 1951.
If there was any doubt about the nature of the relief desired to be granted by the order of 2nd August the same Judges have made it per fectly clear by their order of the 6th of August, wherein they have stated that except for these directions they were not prepared to make any other order on the petitions.
The result therefore is that while the Judges declined to inves tigate and pronounce on the rights of the parties and ex pressly kept the determination thereof in abeyance in the suit proposed to be filed by the present respondents, they gave directions for interim relief till such suit was filed.
It must be noted that with the passing of the order of the 2nd August, 1951, containing directions in the nature of interim relief the petitions were completely disposed of and have not been kept pending for disposal.
Those directions embody therefore the final order passed by the Court on these petitions.
A preliminary objection was raised about the maintainability of the appeals on the ground that no final orders were passed on the petitions.
That objection must fail in view of the fact that with these orders the petitions were disposed of finally and nothing further remained to be done in respect of the petitions.
The fact that the operation of the order is limited to three months or a week after the filing of the intended suit does not prevent the order from being final.
On behalf of the appellant it was urged that the Court had no jurisdiction to pass such orders under article 226 under the circumstances of the case.
This is not a case where the Court before finally disposing of a petition under article 226 gave directions in the nature of interim relief for the purpose of maintaining the status quo.
, The question which we have to determine is whether directions in the nature of interim relief only could be granted under article 226, when the Court expressly stated that it refrained from determining the rights of the parties on which a writ 35 of mandamus or directions of a like nature could be issued.
In our opinion, article 226 cannot be used for the purpose of giving interim relief as the only and final relief on the application as the High Court has purported to do.
The directions have been given here only to circumvent the provisions of section 80 of the Civil Procedure Code, and in our opinion that is not within the scope of article 226.
An interim relief can be granted only in aid of and as ancil lary to the main relief which may be available to the party on final determination of his rights in a suit or proceed ing.
If the Court was of opinion that there ' was no other convenient or adequate remedy open to the petitioners, it might have proceeded to investigate the case on its merits and come to a decision as to whether the petitioners suc ceeded in establishing that there was an infringement of any of their legal rights which entitled them to a writ of mandamus or any other directions of a like nature; and pending such determination it might have made a suitable interim order for maintaining the status quo ante.
But when the Court declined to decide on the rights of the parties and expressly held that they should be investigated more properly in a civil suit, it could not, for the purpose of facilitating the institution of such suit, issue directions in the nature of temporary injunctions, under article 226 of the Constitution.
In our opinion, the language of article 226 does not permit such an action.
On that short ground the judgment of the Orissa High Court under appeal cannot be upheld.
Appeals allowed.
Agent for the appellant in all the appeals: P.A. Mehta.
Agent for the respondent in Case No. 300 : S.P. Varma.
Agent for the respondent in Cases Nos. 301 and 304: Ganpat Rai.
Agent for the respondent in Cases Nos. 302 and 303: P.K. Chatterjee.
","The High Court cannot make a direction under article 226 of the Constitution for the purpose of granting interim relief only pending the institution of a suit merely because the suit could not be instituted until after the expiry of 60 days from the date of a notice under Sec. 80 of the Civil Procedure Code and in the meanwhile, unless protected by the Court the applicant may suffer irreparable loss.
Even though writs can be issued under article 226 for purposes other than the enforcement of fundamental rights, the concluding words of the article have to be read in the context of what precedes the same, and the existence of a right is the foundation of the exercise of jurisdiction of the Court under this article.
An interim relief can be granted only in aid of, and as ancillary to, the main relief which may be available to the party on final determination of his rights in a suit or proceeding.

Appeal from the Judgment and Decree of the Bombay High Court (Macklin and Rajadhyaksha JJ.) dated 14th March.
1945, in First Appeal No. 274 of 1941 which arose out of a decree dated 15th March, 209 1941, of the First Class Subordinate Judge of Satara in Civil Suit No. 890 of 1938.

December 17.
The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MUKHERJEA J.
This appeal is directed against a judgment and decree of a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court dated the 14th of March, 1945, which affirmed, on appeal, the decision of the First Class Subordinate Judge, Satara, passed in Civil Suit No 890 of 1938.
The appellants before us filed the suit as plaintiffs in the original court, for establishment of their title to the property in dispute which is known as Chikurde Estate, on the allegation that they were, under the Hindu Law, the nearest heirs of one Bhimabai, who was admittedly the last holder of the estate.
The suit was brought initially against one defendant, name ly, the Court of Wards, Satara, and admittedly the Court of Wards took possession of the property of Bhimabai, while she was alive, and is continuing in possession of the same even now after her death.
Later on, defendants 2, 3 and 4, who put forward rival claims of succession to the estate, were allowed to intervene in the suit and were added as parties defendants.
The Court of Wards, which now figures as defend ant No. 1, took up, all through, a neutral attitude and expressed its willingness to hand over the estate to any person who would be declared to be rightfully entitled to it by the Court.
The Courts below have negatived the claims of defendants 2 and 3 and they have not come up to press.
their claims in the appeal before us.
The two rival claim ants, who are now on the scene, are the plaintiffs on one side and defendant No. 4 on the other, and the whole contro versy in this appeal centres round the 210 point as to who amongst them have the preferential right to succeed to the disputed estate after the death of Bhimabai.
To appreciate the material facts of the case and the conten tions that have been raised by the parties, it will be convenient to refer to the following genealogy which is not disputed by either side.
Vithalrao (died 1896) Ganpatrao (died 1914) Nilkanthrao Anandrao Tangawa alias (died 1899) (died 1913) Anandibai (Deft. 2) Krishnabai Adopted Deft.
3 Vithalrao (Deft. 4) Babasaheb on adopted by 3 2 1939.
Krishnabai on 4 11 1924 Respdt.
Firangojirao (died Tanakka (predeceas angabai (died 15 11 1919.) ed her sister Gangabai on 14 2 1924) without any issue).
Nathgauda Annagauda Balgauda (Plff. 2) Bhimabai (daughter) (Plff. No. 1) Appellant No. 2. (died on 27 1 1932).
Appellant No. 1 It is the case of both the parties that Vithalrao, whose name appears at the top of the pedigree table, and who was the common ancestor of the parties, held the disputed property as watan property appertaining to the hereditary office of Deshmukhi service.
Vithalrao was the recipient of a Sanad dated 28th November, 1892, under what was called the Gordon Settlement, the object of which was to commute serv ices of certain watandars in that part of the country and relieve them from liability to perform the services attached to their office on certain terms and conditions which were agreed upon between the Government on the one hand and the watandars on the other.
The terms of the settlement were generally embodied in Sanads and one such Sanad was granted to Vithalrao in 1892.
It is not disputed that after this settlement Vithalrao continued to be watandar as defined by Bombay Act III of 1874, and that the watan in dispute was an impartible estate governed by the rule of 211 primogeniture.
In 1896 Vithalrao died and he was succeeded by his eldest son Ganpatrao under the law of primogeniture.
Ganpatrao died childless in 1914, leaving behind him his two widows Anandibai and indirabai, of whom the senior widow Anandibais defendant No. 2 in the present suit.
Both the two brothers of Ganpatrao, namely, Nilkanthrao and Anan drao had predeceased him.
Nilkanthrao left behind him one son named Firangojirao and two daughters, while Anandrao died childless, leaving him surviving his widow Krishnabai, who later on adopted Vithalrao, who is defendant No. 4 in the suit.
Ganpatrao had left a will bequeathing all his watan and nonwatan properties to Firangojirao and the latter succeeded to the estate both under the will as well as under the law of lineal promogeniture, he being the only male member of the family at that time.
Firangojirao died in 1919, leaving Bhimabai, his only daughter, who was a minor at that time.
On 23rd September, 1921, the name of Bhimabai was entered in the village records as watandar in place of Firangojirao and in the year following the Court of Wards, Satara, assumed superintendence of Bhimabai 's estate.
On 11th October, 1923, the Government of Bombay by their Reso lution No. A 471 declared the Chikurde Deshmukh watan as lapsed to Government, presumably on the ground that there was no male heir in the watan family after the death of Firangojirao.
A new entry was then made in the village register which recorded Bhimabai not as watandar, but as heir of Firangojirao and the lands were described as being converted into ryotvari lands after forfeiture by Govern ment and subjected to full assessment.
On 4th of November, 1924, Krishnabai, the widow of Anandrao, adopted defendant No. 4 as a son to her husband.
On 27th January, 1932, Bhima bai died unmarried and her estate continued under the man agement of the Court of Wards.
The appellants before us, who are the sister 's sons of Firangojirao, brought this suit on 5th of August, 1938, and their case, in substance, is that after the Resolution of the Government passed on 11th 212 of October, 1923, the Chikurde estate ceased to be a watan property and the succession to such estate was governed by the ordinary rules of Hindu Law and not by the provisions of Act V of 1886 which postpone relations claiming through a female to a male member of the watan family.
It was urged that the property being the absolute property of Bhimabai and she having died while still a maiden, the plaintiffs, being the nearest heirs of her father, were entitled to succeed under the general rules of Hindu Law.
As said al ready, the defendant No. 4, who is respondent No. 2 in this appeal, was added as a party defendant sometime after the suit was filed and the contention raised on his behalf was that by reason of his having been duly adopted.
to Anandrao on 4th of November, 1924, he was the nearest heir to the property in suit which was a watan property and prayed that a declaration in his favour might be made by the court.
The defendant No. 3 claimed to have been adopted as a son to her husband Ganpatrao by Anandibai, the defendant No. 2, some time in February 1939.
The trial court on a consideration of the evidence came to the conclusion that the Chikurde estate was an impartible property governed by the rules of primogeniture.
It was held that, it being an impartible joint estate, the rule of survivorship still applied and consequently on the death of Ganpatrao, without leaving any son, the estate passed by survivorship to the next senior branch which was that of Firangojirao.
The view taken by the Subordinate Judge is that after Firangojirao 's death Bhimabai took only a provi sional interest in the property which was liable to be divested by the emergence of a male member by adoption in the family and in fact she was legally divested of her interest in the property when defendant No. 4 was adopted by Anandrao 's widow.
In the opinion of the Subordinate Judge the resolution of the Government treating the Chikurde estate as lapsed was premature and could not be made legally so long as there were widows living, who were capable of adopting sonS.
The trial judge held further that even 213 if Bhimabai was taken to have held the property as watan till her death, the next heir to succeed under the Bombay Act V of 1886 would be defendant No. 4 and not the plain tiffs.
The result was that the plaintiffs ' suit was dismissed.
The plaintiffs then took an appeal to the High Court of Bombay and this appeal was heard by a Division Bench consisting of Macklin in and Rajadhyaksha JJ.
The learned Judges dismissed the appeal and confirmed the deci sion of the trial court, though the reasons given by them are not the same as those given by the trial judge.
It was held by the High Court, on a construction of the Sanad granted to Vithalrao in 1892, that the order of lapse or forfeiture of the watan estate passed by the Government in the year 1923 on the ground of failure of male heirs was not a valid and legal order and although under the relevant clause of the Sanad the Government could, in the absence of male heirs, resume the watan in the sense that they could make the property liable to full assessment, the other incidents of the watan estate still continued.
Consequently, Act V of 1886 would still govern succession to such property and defendant No. 4 had preferential rights over the plain tiffs under section 2 of that Act.
It is against this decision that the plaintiffs have come up on appeal to this court.
The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the plain tiffs appellants has raised a two fold contention in support of the appeal.
It has been contended in the first place that the High Court was in error in holding that the Chikurde estate retained its watan character even after it was re sumed by the Government by its Resolution of 11th October, 1923; and if it was non watan, the plaintiffs would be nearer heirs to Bhimabai than defendant No. 4.
The other contention raised is that even if the property remained watan in the hands of Bhimabai, the latter would have to be regarded as a watandar in the true sense of the word and would be a fresh stock of descent.
In that view the plain tiffs would come within the family of 28 214 watandar as defined in Bombay Act V of 1886, whereas the defendant No. 4 would be outside the family.
The points undoubtedly are interesting, but having regard to the view which we have decided to take, it would not be necessary to investigate the merits of either of them.
It may be pointed out that the learned Judges of the High Court proceeded throughout on the assumption that the plaintiffs would have preferential rights of succession if the property was regarded as non watan in the hands of Bhimabai.
It is only if the property was watan that the Bombay Act of 1886 will apply and the plaintiffs, who were descended through females, would be postponed to defendant No. 4 who by adop tion became a male member of the family.
Mr. Setalvad, appearing for defendant No. 4 who is respondent No. 2 in this appeal, contended before us that this assumption is wrong, and that even if the property was regarded as nonwa tan property and belonging absolutely to Bhimabai as her stridhan, still as heir of Bhimabai 's absolute property the defendant No. 4 would have higher rights than the plain tiffs.
As this point was not touched upon in the judgments of either of the courts below, we heard the learned Counsel on both sides at great length upon it and the conclusion that we have reached is that the contention of the learned AttorneyGeneral is well founded and must prevail.
For the purpose of this argument we would assume that the property in suit was non watan stridhan property of Bhimabai and the only question is, as to who amongst the rival claimants would be the nearer heir after her death according to the Hindu Law of inheritance ? It is admitted that Bhimabai died while she was a maiden and that a maid en 's property under the Hindu Law goes in the first place to her uterine brothers, in default of them to the mother and then to the father.
This is according to the text of Baudhayana (1)which is accepted by all the commenta tors.
Viramitrodaya adds to this that ""on failure of mother and father it goes to their (1) See Mitakshara, Chap.
II, sec.
XI, para 30.
215 nearest relations""(1).
It has been held in a large number of cases that the expression ""nearest relations of the parents"" means and refers to the sapindas of then, father and in their default the sapindas of the mother both in order of propinquity(2).
In the case c before us, both the plain tiffs and defendant No. 4 are sapindas of Firangojirao, the plaintiffs being the sister 's sons of Firangojirao, while the latter is his paternal uncle 's son.
It is not dis puted that apart from the changes introduced by the Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act, (Act II of 1929), the place of the paternal uncle 's son in the line of heirs under the Mitakshara Law of Succession is much higher than that of the sister 's son and the Mayukha Law, which prevails in the State of Bombay, does not make any difference in this re spect.
Under the Mitakshara Law, the paternal uncle comes just after the paternal grandfather and his son follows him immediately.
By Act II of 1929, however, four other rela tions have been introduced between the grandfather and the paternal uncle and they are the son 's daughter, daughter 's daughter, sister and sister 's son, and the paternal uncle and his son are thus postponed to these four relations by the Hindu Law of Inheritance Act of 1929.
The question is, whether the provisions of this Act can at all be invoked to determine the heirs of a Hindu female in respect of her stridhan property.
The object of the Act as stated in the preamble is to alter the order in which certain heirs of a Hindu male dying intestate are entitled to succeed to his estate; and section 1 (2) expressly lays down that ""the Act applies only to persons who but for the passing of this Act would have been subject to the Law of Mitakshara in respect of the provisions herein enacted, and it applies to such persons in respect only of the property of males not held in coparcenary and not disposed of by will"".
Thus the scope of the Act is limited.
It governs succession only to the separate property of a Hindu male who dies intestate.
It does (1) See Viramitrodaya, Chap.
V, Part II, Sec. 9.
(2) See Mayne 's Hindu Law, 11th edition, article 621, page 741.
216 not alter the law as regards the devolution of any other kind of property owned by a Hindu male and does not purport to regulate succession to the property of a Hindu female at all.
It is to be noted that the Act does not make these four relations statutory heirs under the Mitakshara Law under all circumstances and for all purposes;it makes them heirs only when the propositus is a male and the property in respect to which it is sought to be applied is his separate property.
Whether this distinction between male and female propositus is at all reasonable is another matter, but the language of the Act makes this distinction expressly and so long as the language is clear and unambiguous, no other consideration is at all relevant.
This is the view which has been taken, and in our opinion quite rightly, in a number of cases of the Madras, Patna and Nagput High Courts(1).
We are not unmindful of the fact that a contrary view has been expressed in certain decisions of the Bombay, Lahore and Allahabad High Courts (2).
The line of reasoning that is adopted in most of the decisions where the contrary view is taken can be thus stated in the language of Mr. Justice Somjee (3):__ ""The Act is not sought to be applied to determine the succession to the stridhan of a Hindu maiden but is sought to be used by the petitioner to ascertain the fourth class of heirs to the stridhan of a Hindu maiden mentioned at page 139 of Mulla 's Hindu Law.
The heirs of the father at the time of her death have to be ascertained in accordance with the Hindu Law as it existed at the time of the death of Bai Champubai.
Thus the Act comes into operation for ascer taining the order in which the heirs of her father would be entitled to succeed to his estate, because the heirs of the father (1) Vide Manda Mahalakshmamma vs Mantravadi (I.L.R. ; Shakuntalabai vs Court of Wards (I.L.R. 1942 Nag. 629); Talukraj Kuer vs Bacha Kuer (I.L.R. 26 Pat.

442); Indra Pal vs Humangi Debi (I.L.R. 1949 All. 816).
(3) Vide Shamrao vs Raghunandan (I.L.R. at 230).
217 in the order of propinquity who would be entitled to succeed to him if he died on August 3, 1937, would be the heirs of Bai Champubai in the absence of the uterine brother, the mother and the father.
"" It is true that we have got to ascertain who the heirs of the father are at the date when the daughter dies, but the enquiry is for the purpose of finding out who the suc cessor to the estate of the daughter is.
This being the subject of the enquiry, the operation of Act II of 1029 is excluded by its express terms and for that purpose the Act is to be treated as non existent.
In other words, the stridhan heirs are to be ascertained with reference to the general provisions of the Hindu Law of Inheritance ignoring the statutory heirs who have been introduced by the Act.
The fallacy in the line of approach adopted in these cases seems to be that they treat the Inheritance Act of 1929 as amending or altering the Mitakshara Law of succession in all cases and for all purposes, whereas the Act has absolutely no operation when succession to the separate property of a male is not the subject matter of investigation.
The result is that in our opinion the plaintiffs are not the nearest heirs of Bhimabai even assuming that the property was non watan and belonged to her absolutely.
The appeal will thus stand dismissed.
We make no order as to costs in this appeal except that defendant No. 1, the Court of Wards, would have its costs as between attorney and client out of the estate.
The order for costs made by the courts below will stand.
Appeal dismissed.
Agent for respondent No. 1: P.A. Mehta.
Agent for respondent No. 2: K.J Kale.
","The Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act (Act II of 1929) which introduced the son 's daughter, daughter 's daugh ter, sister and sister 's son between the grandfather and the paternal uncle in the order of succession applies only to the separate property of a Hindu male who dies intestate.
It does not alter the law as regards the devolution of any other kind of property owned by a Hindu male and does not purport to regulate succession to the property of a Hindu female at all.
The Act cannot therefore be invoked to determine the heirs of a Hindu female in respect of her stridhan property.
The property of a Hindu female who dies as a maiden goes in the first place to her uterine brothers, then to the mother and then to the father, and on failure of the mother and father, it goes to the nearest relations, that is to say, to the sapindas of the father and in their default the sapindas of the mother, both in the order of propinquity.
Under the Mitakshara law of succession as well as the Mayukha law the paternal uncle 's son is entitled to succeed to the property of a Hindu in preference to sister 's sons.

The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALl J.
This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court at Patiala upholding the conviction and sentence of the appellant, who was tried by the Sessions Judge of Sangrut for the offence of murder and sentenced to death.
373 The prosecution story is a somewhat long and complicated one, but ignoring unnecessary details, the material facts may be shortly stated as follows : On the 5th October, 1949, there was a quarrel between the appellant and one Darbara Singh, in the course of which the appellant attacked the latter with a phawra (a cutting instrument).
About that time, Gurmail Singh, the deceased person, returned to his house, which was close to the house of Darbara Singh, from his cotton field, where he had been working, in order to take tea for his companions who were still working in his field.
The appellant asked Gutmail Singh to lend him a spear to enable him to kill Darbara Singh, but since the latter refused to do so, there ensued a quarrel between him and the appellant, in the course of which they exchanged abuses and grappled with each other, and the fight was stopped only by the intervention of cer tain persons present at the place.
It appears that the appellant was greatly affected by this quarrel, and thereaf ter he is said to have armed himself with a rifle and at tacked 3 persons in the vicinity of Gurmail Singh 's cotton field.
He fired firstly at Kartar Singh, son of Satwan Singh, while the latter was returning to his house from the field of Gutmail Singh, but he was not hurt.
Soon after that, while Gurmail Singh was returning to his field after attending to his buffaloes in a garden which was nearby, the appellant chased him and fired at him thereby causing his instantaneous death.
Lastly, he is said to have fired at Kartar Singh, son of Bishan Singh and one Jangir Singh, while they were raising an alarm, but the bullet missed them.
Upon these allegations, the following three charges were framed against him : ""(1) That you. fired a shot at Gurmail Singh deceased with rifle P.I. with the intention of killing him and caused his death and thereby committed an offence pun ishable under section 302. (2) That you. fired a shot at Kartar Singh and Jangir Singh with rifle P.I. with the intention of causing death and made an attempt to cause their death 374 section 307. . (3) That you. . fired a gun shot at Kartar Singh s/o Satwan Singh. with the intention of killing him and made an attempt to cause his death and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 307. "" It appears that the appellant was an Instructor in the Home Guards.
and the rifle which he is said to have used had been given to him by his superior officer with 20 rounds of ammunition.
To support their version of the occurrence, the prosecu tion examined 3 eye witnesses whose evidence has been ac cepted by both the courts below after careful scrutiny.
The learned Sessions Judge acquitted the appellant of the second and third charges under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, holding that there was no convincing evidence that the appellant intended to murder Jangit Singh and the other 2 persons.
He however convicted him of the first charge under section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to death, which sentence was later confirmed by the High Court.
The learned counsel for the appellant had very little to argue on the merits of the case, but he seriously contended that there had been a misjoinder of charges which could not be tried together under the law, and the illegality so committed had vitiated the whole trial of the appellant.
It appears that in the High Court, the line of argument on this point was somewhat different from the line adopted in this court.
What was stressed in that court seems to have been that the three incidents in respect of which the appellant was charged not having happened in the course of the same transaction, they could not have been properly made the subject of one trial, and for this contention reliance was placed mainly on section 235 (1)of the Criminal Procedure Code, which provides that ""if, in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction, more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be at one trial for, every such offence.
"" It should be noted 375 that that section is only one of the exceptions to the general rule laid down in section 233 of the Code that for every distinct offence, there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried separately.
In this court, no reference was made to section 235, but the argument was confined to the question as to whether the present case falls within another exception of section 23 '3 which is contained in section 234 (1) which runs as 'follows : ""When a person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of such offences, whether in respect of the same person or not, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for any number of them not exceeding three.
"" It was argued before us that even though only 3 charges have been framed against the appellant, he has in fact been tried for 4 offences and not 3.
The 4 offences are said to be these : (1) Committing the murder of Gurmail Singh; (2) Attempting to murder Kartar Singh, son of Sarwan Singh; (3) Attempting to murder Jangit Singh; and (4) Attempting to murder Kartar Singh, son of Bishan Singh.
The learned counsel contended that the fact that the appellant has been acquitted of the last 3 offences and convicted only of the first offence was immaterial to the point raised by him, and we have only to see whether all the offences mentioned above could be properly tried together.
In our opinion, the short reply to this contention is that the second charge which relates to the appellant firing at Kartar Singh and Jangir Singh is not a charge with respect to 2 offences but is a charge with respect to one offence only.
The evidence adduced by the prosecution shows that the appellant fired only one bullet.
The word ""offence"" has been defined in the Criminal Procedure Code as meaning ""any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force"".
There seems to be 49 376 nothing wrong in law to regard the single act of firing by the appellant as one offence only.
On the other hand, we think that it would be taking an extremely narrow and arti ficial view to split it into 2 offences.
There are several reported cases in which a similar view has been taken, and in our opinion they have not been incorrectly decided.
In Queen Empress vs Raghu Rai(1), where a person stole several bullocks from the same herdsman at the same time, it was held that only one offence had been committed.
In Promotha Nath Ray vs King Emperor(2), it was held that misappropria tion in regard to several account books constituted only one offence.
In Johan Subarna vs King EmPeror(3), it was held that when an attempt to cheat a number of men by speaking to them in a body had been committed, one joint charge was valid.
In Poonit Singh vs Madho Bhot (4), it was held that only one offence had been committed by a person who gave false information in one statement to the police against 2 persons.
In Sudheendrakumar Ray vs Emperor(5), a person who was chased by 2 constables had fired at them several times, but it seems to have been rightly assumed that the firing did not constitute more than one offence, though the point was not specifically raised or decided.
In our opinion, there is no substance in the point raised, though we should not be understood as laying down the wide proposition that in no case can a single act constitute more than one of fence.
The other points urged on behalf of the appellant before us were somewhat unsubstantial points relating to the merits of the case, which it is not usual for this court to allow to be raised in appeals by special leave.
In our opinion, this appeal is without merit, and it is accordingly dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
Agent for the caveator: Vidya Sagar.
","The appellant was tried in respect of the following charges: (i) causing the death of A and thereby committing an offence punishable under section 302, Penal Code, (ii) firing a shot at B and 372 C with the intention of causing their death and thereby committing an offence punishable under section 307, Penal Code, and (iii) firing a shot at D with the intention of killing him and thereby committing an offence punishable under section 307, Penal Code.
It was contended on his behalf that there was a misjoinder of charges as the second charge was really a charge in respect of two offences viz., attempt to murder B and attempt to murder C and the accused had therefore been charged with, and tried for, more than three offences in contravention of section 234 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code :.Held, that there was nothing wrong in the trial as the single act of firing a shot at B and C is one offence and not two offences and the trial was not bad for misjoinder of charges.

The appellant Rameshwar was charged with com mitting rape on a young girl Mst.
Purni, eight years of age.
He was committed to Sessions and was convicted by the As sistant Sessions Judge, Sawai Jaipur, and sentenced to one year 's rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 250.
An appeal was made to the Sessions Judge at Jaipur, that being the appropriate appellate tribunal in that area.
The learned Sessions Judge held that the evidence was sufficient for moral conviction but fell short of legal proof because, in his opinion, the law requires corroboration of the story of the prosecution in such cases as a matter of precaution and the corroborative evidence, in so far as it sought to connect the appellant with the crime, was legally insuffi cient though morally enough.
He was satisfied however that the girl had been raped by somebody.
Accordingly, he acquit ted the accused giving him the benefit of the doubt.
The State of Sawal Jaipur and Gangapur appealed against the acquittal to the High Court at Jaipur.
380 The learned High Court Judges held that the law requires corroboration in such cases but held that the girl 's state ment made to her mother was legally admissible as corrobora tion and considering that sufficient they set aside the acquittal and restored the conviction and sentence.
The High Court later granted leave to appeal under article 134 (1)(c) of the Constitution as the case involved questions of law of general importance.
The first point taken before us related to the admissi bility of the evidence of the girl herself.
Her age was stated to be seven or eight years at the time of the exami nation by the learned Assistant Sessions Judge who recorded her testimony.
He certified that she did not understand the sanctity of an oath and accordingly did not administer one to her.
He did not certify that the child understood the duty of speaking the truth.
The proviso to section 5 of the , prescribes that ""Provided that where the witness is a child under twelve years of age, and the Court or person having authority to examine such witness is of opinion that, though he understands the duty of speaking the truth, he does not understand the nature of an oath or affirmation, the forego ing provisions of this section and the provisions of section 6 shall not apply to such witness, but in any such case the absence of an oath or affirmation shall not render inadmis sible any evidence given by such witness nor affect the obligation of the witness to state the truth.
"" The question is whether the opinion referred to must be formally recorded or whether it can be inferred from the circumstances in which the deposition was taken.
The proviso quoted above must be read along with section 118 of the Evidence Act and section 13 of the Oaths Act.
In my opinion, an omission to administer an oath, even to an adult, goes only to the credibility of the witness and not his competency.
The question of competency is dealt with in section 118.
Every 381 witness is competent unless the Court considers he is pre vented from understanding the questions put to him, or from giving rational answers by reason of tender years, extreme old age, disease whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind.
It will be observed that there is always competency in fact unless the court considers otherwise.
No other ground of incompetency is given, therefore, unless the Oaths Act adds additional grounds of incompetency it is evident that section 118 must prevail.
Now the Oaths Act does not deal with competency.
Its main object is to render persons who give false evidence liable to prosecution.
It is true a subsidiary object is to bring home to the witness the solemnity of the occasion and to impress upon him the duty of speaking the truth, but in view of section 118 these matters only touch credibility and not admissibility.
In my opinion, section 13 of the Oaths Act places this beyond doubt.
It states ""No omission to take any oath or make any affirmation. . and no irregularity whatever, in the form in which any one of them is administered, shall invali date any proceeding or render inadmissible any evidence whatever. . "" Section 5 is the main provision regarding the adminis tration of oaths.
The proviso only sets out the cases in which the oath is not to be administered.
If, therefore, an omission to take the oath does not affect the admissibility of the evidence, it follows that irregularity of the kind we are considering which arises out of the proviso cannot affect the admissibility either.
Section 118 remains and unless the judge considers otherwise the witness is compe tent.
I do not think it will be useful to consider English authorities on the point because we are governed here by the terms of the various sections I have referred to.
But a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privyi Council is in point.
Their Lordships stated in Mohamed Sugal Esa vs The King(1) : (1) A.I.R. 1946 P.C. 3 at 5 382 ""Section 13, Oaths Act, is quite unqualified in its terms and there is nothing to suggest that it is to apply only where the omission to administer the oath occurs per incuriam.
If that had been the intention of the Legislature, it would have been simple to insert words in the section to that effect. .
It may be observed that this question can no longer arise in India because in 1939 the Legislature passed the Oaths (Amendment) Act (Act XXXIX of 1939) which settles the law in accordance with the Bengal and Oudh decisions referred to above.
"" The decisions to which their Lordships refer are and Ram Samujh vs Emperor(2).
The decisions there were that the section being unqualified in terms did apply to a case where the Court accepted the evidence of a child to whom the oath was not administered on the ground that the witness did not understand its nature.
The principle of the decisions ap plies here because, as their Lordships observe, the section is unqualified in its terms.
I would add however that it is desirable that judges and magistrates should always record their opinion that the child understands the duty of speaking the truth and state why they think that, otherwise the credibility of the wit ness may be seriously affected, so much so, that in some cases it may be necessary to reject the evidence altogether.
But whether the magistrate or judge really was of that opinion can, I think, be gathered from the circumstances when there is no formal certificate.
In the present case, it is plain that the learned Judge had the proviso in mind because he certified that the witness does not understand the nature of an oath and so did not administer one but despite that went on to take her evidence.
It is also an important fact that the accused, who was represented by counsel, did not object.
Had he raised the point the Judge would doubtless have made good the omission.
I am of opinion that Mst.
Purni was a competent witness and that her evi dence is admissible.
In (1) F.N. (2) (1907) 10 O.C. 337 383 the Privy Council case which I have just cited, their Lord ships said ""It is not to be supposed that any judge would accept as a witness a person who he considered was incapable not only of understanding the nature of an oath but also the necessi ty of speaking the truth when examined as a witness.
"" That is the very point here.
One can presume that the learned Judge had that in mind from the fact that he exam ined the child after referring to a fact which arises out of the proviso.
As regards her credibility, the learned trial Judge, who recorded her evidence and saw her in the box, has believed her, so has the High Court; and it is important to note that the learned Sessions Judge who acquitted the accused has not disbelieved her.
On the contrary he says he is morally convinced.
All he says is that in the absence of corrobora tion it will be unsafe to convict because the Privy Council and other cases advise corroboration as a matter of pru dence.
We were taken carefully through the evidence, as elabo rately as in a court of first appeal.
I am of opinion that the learned High Court Judges were fully justified in ac cepting the evidence of Purni and in believing her mother Mst.
Ghisi.
I consider it unnecessary to recapitulate their reasons.
After the careful analysis given by three Courts it is sufficient to say that I agree with the learned High Court Judges.
We are left therefore with the questions of law.
The first question is whether the law requires corrobo ration in these cases.
Now the Evidence Act now here says so.
On the other hand, when dealing with the testimony of an accomplice, though it says in section 114 (b) that the Court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars, it makes it clear in section 133 that ""An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and a conviction is not 50 384 illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.
"" Now a woman who has been raped is not an accomplice.
If she was ravished she is the victim of an outrage.
If she consented there is no offence unless she is a married woman, in which case questions of adultery may arise.
But adultery presupposes consent and so is not on the same footing as rape.
In the case of a girl who is below the age of consent, her consent will not matter so far as the offence of rape is concerned, but if she consented her testimony will natural ly be as suspect as that of an accomplice.
So also in the case of unnatural offences.
But in all these cases a large volume of case law has grown up which treats the evidence of the complainant somewhat along the same lines as accomplice evidence though often for widely differing reasons and the position now reached is that the rule about corroboration has hardened into one of law.
But it is important to under stand exactly what the rule is and what the expression ""hardened into a rule of law"" means.
In my judgment, this branch of the law is the same as in England and I am of opinion that the lucid exposition of it given by Lord Reading, the Lord Chief Justice of England, in The King vs Baskerville(1) cannot be bettered.
In that case, Baskerville had been convicted of having committed acts of gross indecency with the two boys.
(There the boys were accomplices because they were freely consent ing parties and there was no use of force).
The learned Chief Justice says at page 663 : ""There is no doubt that the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice is admissible in law.
But it has long been a rule of practice at common law for the judge to warn the jury of the danger of convicting a prisoner on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice or accomplices, and, in the discretion of the judge, to advise them not to convict upon such evidence; but the judge should point out to the jury that it is (1) 385 within their legal province to convict upon such unconfirmed evidence.
This rule of practice has become virtually equivalent to a rule of law, and since the Court of Criminal Appeal came into operation this Court has held that, in the absence of such a warning by the judge, the conviction must be quashed.
If after the proper caution by the judge the jury nevertheless convict the prisoner, this Court will not quash the conviction merely upon the ground that the accom plice 's testimony was uncorroborated.
"" That, in my opinion, is exactly the law in India so far as accomplices are concerned and it is certainly not any higher in the case of sexual offences.
The only clarifica tion necessary for purposes of this country is where this class of offence is sometimes tried by a judge without the aid of a jury.
In these cases it is necessary that the judge should give some indication in his judgment that he has had this rule of caution in mind and should proceed to give reasons for considering it unnecessary to require corroboration on the facts of the particular case before him and show why he considers it safe to convict without corrob oration in that particular case.
I am of opinion that the learned High Court Judges were wrong in thinking that they could not, as a matter of law, convict without corrobora tion.
There is a class of cases which considers that though corroboration should ordinarily be required in the case of a grown up woman it is unnecessary in the case of a child of tender years.
Bishram.
vs Emperor(1) is typical of that point of view.
On the other hand, the Privy Council has said in Mohamed Sugal Esa vs The King(2) that as a matter of prudence a conviction should not ordinarily be based on the uncorroborated evidence of a child witness.
In my opinion, the true rule is that in every case of this type the rule about the advisability of corroboration should be present to the mind of the judge.
In a jury case he must tell the (1) A.I.R. 1944 Nag. 363.
(2) A.I.R. 1946 P.C. 3 at 5.
386 jury of it and in a non jury case he must show that it is present to his mind by indicating that in his judgment.
But he should also point out that corroboration can be dispensed with if, in the particular circumstances of the case before him, either the jury, or, when there is no jury, he himself, is satisfied that it is safe to do so.
The rule, which according to the cases has hardened into one of law, is not that corroboration is essential before there can be a con viction but that the necessity of corroboration, as a matter of prudence, except where the circumstances make it safe to dispense with it, must be present to the mind of the judge, and in jury cases, must find place in the charge, before a conviction without corroboration can be sustained.
The tender years of the child, coupled with other circumstances appearing in the case, such, for example, as its demeanour, unlikelihood of tutoring and so forth, may render corrobora tion unnecessary but that is a question of fact in every case.
The only rule of law is that this rule of prudence must be present to the mind of the judge or the jury as the case may be and be understood and appreciated by him or them.
There is no rule of practice that there must, in every case, be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand.
I turn next to the nature and extent of the corrobora tion required when it is not considered safe to dispense with it.
Here, again, the rules are lucidly expounded by Lord Reading in Baskerville 's case(1) at pages 664 to 669.
It would be impossible.
indeed it would be dangerous, to formulate the kind of evidence which should, or would, be regarded as corroboration.
Its nature and extent must necessarily vary with circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged.
But to this extent the rules are clear.
First, it is not necessary that there should be inde pendent confirmation of every material circumstance in the sense that the independent evidence in the case, apart from the testimony of the complainant or the (1) , 387 accomplice, should in itself be sufficient to sustain con viction.
As Lord Reading says ``Indeed, if it were required that the accomplice should be confirmed in every detail of the crime, his evidence would not be essential to the case, it would be merely confirmatory of other and independent testimony.
"" All that is required is that there must be ""some addi tional evidence rendering it probable that the story of the accomplice (or complainant) is true and that it is reasona bly safe to act upon it.
"" Secondly, the independent evidence must not only make it safe to believe that the crime was committed but must in some way reasonably connect or tend to connect the accused with it by confirming in some material particular the testi mony of the accomplice or complainant that the accused committed the crime.
This does not mean that the corrobora tion as to identity must extend to all the circumstances necessary to identify the accused with the offence.
Again, all that is necessary is that there should be independent evidence which will make it reasonably safe to believe the witness 's story that the accused was the one, or among those, who committed the offence.
The reason for this part of the rule is that ""a man who has been guilty of a crime himself will always be able to relate the facts of the case, and if the confirmation be only on the truth of that history, without identifying the persons, that is really no corroboration at all.
It would not at all tend to show that the party ac cused participated in it.
"" Thirdly, the corroboration must come from independent sources and thus ordinarily the testimony of one accomplice would not be sufficient to corroborate that of another.
But of course the circumstances may be such as to make it safe to dispense with the necessity of corroboration and in those special circumstances a conviction so based would not be illegal.
I say this because it was contended that the mother in this case was not an independent source.
388 Fourthly, the corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime.
It is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime.
Were it otherwise, ""many crimes which are usually committed between accomplices in secret, such as incest, offences with females"" (or unnatural offences) ""could never be brought to justice."" Next, I turn to another aspect of the case.
The learned High Court Judges have used Mst.
Purni 's statement to her mother as corroboration of her statement.
The ques tion arises, can the previous statement of an accomplice, or a complainant, be accepted as corroboration ? That the evidence is legally admissible as evidence of conduct is indisputable because of Illustration (j) to section 8 of the Evidence Act which is in these terms: ""The question is whether A was ravished.
The facts that, shortly after the alleged rape, she made a complaint relating to the crime, the circumstances under which, and the terms in which, the complaint was made are relevant.
"" But that is not the whole problem.
for we are concerned here not only with its legal admissibility and relevancy as to conduct but as to its admissibility for a particular purpose, namely corroboration.
The answer to that is to be found in section 157 of the Evidence Act which lays down the law for India.
Section 157 states that ""In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.
"" The section makes no exceptions, therefore, provided the condition prescribed, that is to say, ""at or about the time etc. ,"" are fulfilled there can be no doubt that such a statement is legally admissible in India as corroboration.
The weight to be attached to it is, of course, another matter and it may be that in some 389 cases the evidentiary value of two statements emanating from the same tainted source may not be high, but in view of section 118 its legal admissibility as corroboration cannot be questioned.
To state this is, however, no more than to emphasise that there is no rule of thumb in these cases.
When corroborative evidence is produced it also has to be weighed and in a given case, as with other evidence, even though it is legally admissible for the purpose on hand its weight may be nil.
On the other hand, seeing that corrobo ration is not essential to a conviction, conduct of this kind may be more than enough in itself to justify acceptance of the complainant 's story.
It all depends on the facts of the case.
In the present case, Mst.
Purni told 'her mother about the incident about four hours after it occurred.
The reason for the delay was that her mother was not at home when she went there.
She says that when she went home she lay down and went to sleep and that when her mother returned she asked her why she was sleeping and then she told her mother what had happened.
Her mother tells much the same story.
She says she had gone out to her field in the morning and did not return till about 4 p.m.
When she reach home she found her daughter lying there weeping.
She has been be lieved by the learned trial Judge as also by the High Court and has not been disbelieved by the learned Sessions Judge.
All he says is that she is not an ""independent"" witness and is therefore not sufficient for corroboration.
The first question is whether this delay fulfills the ""at or about"" condition.
In my opinion, here also there can be no hard and fast rule.
The main test is whether the statement was made as early as can reasonably be expected in the circumstances of the case and before there was opportu nity for tutoring or concoction.
It was suggested that the child could have complained to some women who were working in the neighbourhood, but that would not be natural in a child.
She would be frightened and her first instinct would be to run home to her mother.
The High Court 390 was satisfied on these points and so am I.
Consequently, the matter does fall within the ambit of section 157 read with section 8, Illustration (j).
The next question is whether the mother can be regard ed as an ""independent"" witness.
So far as this case is con cerned, I have no doubt on that score.
It may be that all mothers may not be sufficiently independent to fulfill the requirements of the corroboration rule but there is no legal bar to exclude them from its operation merely on the ground of their relationship.
Independent merely means independent of sources which are likely to be tainted.
In the absence of enmity against the accused there is no reason why she should implicate him falsely.
It is true the ac cused suggested that they were on bad terms but that has not been believed by anyone.
The third question is whether there is independent corroboration connecting the accused with the crime.
The only corroboration relied on for that is the previous state ment of the child to her mother.
That might not always be enough but this rule can be waived in a given case just as much as the necessity for any corroboration at all.
In the present case, the learned High Court Judges would have acted on the uncorroborrated testimony of the girl had they not felt pressed by the corroboration rule.
Viewing all the circumstances I am satisfied that the High Court was right.
I am satisfied that in this case, considering the conduct of the girl and her mother from start to finish, no corrobora tion beyond the statement of the child to her mother was necessary.
I am satisfied that the High Court was right in holding that that was enough to make it safe to act on her testimony.
I would dismiss the appeal and direct the appellant to surrender to his bail in accordance with the terms of his bond, serve out his sentence and pay the fine.
FAZL ALI J.
I agree.
Appeal dismissed.
","An omission to administer an oath, even to an adult, goes only to the credibility of the witness and not his competency; so also an omission of the Court or the authori ty examining a child witness formally to record that in its opinion the witness understands the duty of speaking the truth though he does not understand the nature of an oath or affirmation, does not affect the admissibility of the evi dence given by that witness.
Though it is desirable that judges and magistrates should always record their opinion when a child is to be examined that the child understands the duty of speaking the truth, and state why they think so, whether a magistrate or judge was really of that opinion can be gathered from the circumstances when there is no formal certificate to that effect on the record.
Mohamed Sugal Esa vs The King (A.I.R. , R, vs Sewa Bhogta F.N.), Samujh vs Emperor (1907) 10 O.C. 337) referred to.
Though a woman who has been raped is not an accomplice, her evidence has been treated by the Courts on somewhat similar lines, and the rule which requires corroboration of such evidence save in exceptional circumstances has now hardened into law.
The rule laid down in King vs Baskerville (L. R. with regard to the admissibility of the uneorrobo rated evidence of an accomplice is the law in India also so far as accomplices are concerned and it is not any higher in the case of sexual offences.
The only clarification of the rule that is necessary for the purposes of India is where this class of offence is tried by a judge without the aid of a jury.
In such cases it is necessary that the judge should give some indication in his judgment that he has had the rule of caution in his mind and should proceed to give reasons for considering it unnecessary to require corrobora tion on the facts of the particular case before him and show why he considers it safe to convict without corroboration in that particular case.
There is, however, no rule of law or 378 practice that there must in every case be corroboration before a conviction can be allowed to stand.
The view that though corroboration should ordinarily be required in the case of a grown up woman, it is unnecessary in the case of a child of tender years is not correct.
The true position is that in every case of this type the rule about the advisability of corroboration should be present to the mind of the judge; whether corroboration is unnecessary is a question of fact in every case.
Bishram vs Emperor (A.I.R. not approved; Mohamed Sugal Esa vs The King (A.I.R. followed.
The nature and the extent of the corroboration that is required when it is not considered safe to dispense with it, must necessarily vary with the circumstances of each case and also according to the particular circumstances of the offence charged.
It is however clear (i) that it is not necessary that there should be independent confirmation of every material circumstance in the sense that the independ ent evidence in the case, apart from the testimony of the complainant or accomplice, should itself be sufficient to sustain conviction; all that is required is that there must be ""some additional evidence rendering it probable that the story of the accomplice (or the complainant) is true and that it is reasonably safe to act upon it,"" (ii) The inde pendent evidence must not only make it safe to believe that the crime was committed but must in some way reasonably connect the accused with it; (iii) the corroboration must come from independent sources and thus ordinarily the testi mony of one accomplice would not be sufficient to corrobo rate that of another accomplice;(iv) the corroboration need not be direct evidence that the accused committed the crime; it is sufficient if it is merely circumstantial evidence of his connection with the crime.
A previous statement of an accomplice or a complainant is admissible as evidence of conduct; it is also admissible as corroborg live evidence provided it fulfills the condi tions laid down in see.
157 of the Evidence Act.
The main test as to whether a previous statement was made ""at or about the time when the fact took place"", within the meaning of sec.
157, Evidence Act, is whether the state ment was made as early as can reasonably be expected in the circumstances of the case and before there was an opportuni ty for tutoring or concoction.
Where a person was charged with having committed rape upon a girl eight years of age and the only evidence to corroborate the testimony of the girl connecting the accused with the crime was a statement made by her to her mother some four hours after the incident, that she had been raped by the accused: Held, that in the circumstances of the case the testimony of the mother was admissible as independent corroborative evidence and 379 the girl 's previous statement was sufficient corroboration of the girl 's testimony for convicting the accused.

The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALl J.
This is an appeal against a judgment of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad reversing the decision of the Sessions Judge of Aligarh in a criminal case.
The appellants were tried by the Sessions Judge on charges under section 302 read with section 149, section 148, sections 325 and 326 read with section 149, and section 201 of the Indian Penal Code, but were acquitted.
On appeal by the State Government, the High Court reversed the Sessions Judge 's decision, and convicted the appellants and sentenced them to transportation for life under section 302 read with section 149, to five years ' rigorous imprisonment under sections 325 and 326 read with section 149, and to two years ' rigorous imprisonment under section 147 of the Indian Penal Code, all the sentences being made to run concurrently.
The appellants thereafter applied to the Privy Council for special leave, which was granted on the 28th October, 1947.
The facts which were put before the court on behalf of the prosecution may be briefly stated as follows.
There is a plot No. 518 in Nagaria Patti Chaharum, village Shahgarh in the district of Aligarh which is about 30 bighas in area and is known as the ""teesa"" field.
This plot was the ""sir"" land of several landlords including Mst.
Bhagwati Kuer and Ratan Singh and had been let out to certain tenants.
In 1944, Mst.
Bhagwati Kuer, Ratan Singh and their co sharers filed a suit for the ejectment of the tenants, and the 195 suit was decreed.
On the 7th June, 1945, possession over the plot was delivered by the Amin to Surajpal Singh, the first appellant, who was the mukhtar i Am of Mst.
Bhagwati Kuer.
It was contended on behalf of Surajpal Singh that he took possession on behalf of all the co sharers, but certain statements made by Ratan Singh in his evidence do not sup port this contention.
However that may be, it appears that on the 17th June, 1945, Ratan Singh reported to the police that he had sent his labourers to irrigate the ""teesa"" field, and while they were irrigating it Surajpal Singh and certain other persons came and tried to stop the irrigation and damaged the ploughs of Ratan Singh.
On the 18th June, at about 7 A.M., the occurrence which is the subject matter of the present trial took place.
The prosecution version of the occurrence was that while Ratan Singh 's labourers were working in the field under the supervision of one Behari Singh, the appellants with many other persons came armed with guns, spears and lathis, and some of the members of the appellants ' party entered the field, cut off the nosestrings of the bullocks and abused and assaulted the labourers, most of whom ran away.
Thereupon, Deva Sukh, who was there to supply water to the labourers, protested and was beaten with lathis.
At that point of time, Behari Singh and 10 to 15 persons came and fight took place between the parties.
During the fight, one of the accused persons, Rajendra Singh, a young lad, fired his gun twice in the air, and thereafter Surajpal Singh took the gun from him and fired two shots hitting Nawab Mewati, who died instantaneously, and Behari Singh, who died later in the day.
Three other persons, Zorawar, Rajpal and Lakhan also received gun shot injuries.
Sometime later, Surajpal Singh along with the other three appellants came to the spot and removed the dead body of Nawab in a cart.
The body was thrown into a river and was recovered on the 20th June, 1945.
After investiga tion 25 persons including the appellants were sent up for trial.
After hearing the evidence in the case, the Ses sions Judge delivered judgment on the 20th February, 1946.
196 He held that the ""teesa"" field was in the possession of Surajpal Singh, that Behari Singh and Ratan Singh 's men were aggressors and wished to take forcible possession of the field, that when resisted they had attacked the appellants ' party, that the person who fired the gun had done so in self defence and not with a view to killing Behari Singh and Nawab Mewati, and that the evidence adduced by the prosecu tion was so unsatisfactory that it was unsafe to convict the accused upon it.
As to the charge of concealing evidence of the offence of murder by the removal of the dead body of Nawab, the Sessions Judge expressed the opinion that in order to convict a person on that charge it must be proved that the offence, the evidence of which the accused is alleged to have caused to disappear had actually been com mitted, but since in the present case the charge of murder was not proved the accused could not be convicted for having caused disappearance of evidence connected with it.
The Judge also held that the evidence being unreliable the charge under section 201 of the Indian Penal Code had not been established beyond reasonable doubt.
The High Court delivered its judgment on the 8th May, 1947, allowing the appeal of the State Government.
Shortly stated, the conclusion arrived at by the High Court was that Ratan Singh had as much right to the possession of the field as Bhagwati Kuer, that both parties were trying to take exclusive possession of the field, that both parties were prepared for all contingencies to vindicate and enforce their rights, and hence the question of possession was wholly immaterial and no right of private defence could be successfully pleaded by the appellants.
A perusal of the two judgments before us shows that while the Sessions Judge took great pains to discuss all the important aspects of the case and to record his opinion on every material point, the learned Judges of the High Court have reversed his decision without displacing the very substantial reasons given by him in support of his conclu sion.
The difference in the treatment of the case by the two courts below 197 is particularly noticeable in the manner in which they have dealt with the prosecution evidence.
We find that while the Sessions Judge took up the evidence of each witness and recorded his finding with regard to his credibility after discussing the minutest details of the evidence, all that the learned Judges of the High Court have to say about the prosecution evidence as a whole is as follows : ""In Prag Dat 's case their Lordships observed: usual in cases of this kind the police have found it difficult to secure independent testimony of what did take place.
Those of the villagers who were present and looking on would probably by sympathy and bias be so attached to one or other of the disputing parties that it would be hopeless to get disinterested and reliable evidence from them. ' This difficulty the police find in most riot cases and this case is not free from it.
But as in Prag Dat 's case, in this case there are four witnesses, viz., Deo Sukh, Rori Singh, Ram Singh, and Ratan Singh, who could be characte rised as independent witnesses and they support the case for the prosecution, in the main.
In our judgment their testimo ny is on the whole worthy of credence and sufficient to justify the conviction of the respondents.
"" In view of the summary treatment of the evidence by the High Court, we had to read the evidence adduced in the case with great care, and what we find is that the four witness es, whose evidence has been accepted by the High Court, are just the persons against whom very serious criticism was offered by the Sessions Judge.
Of these witnesses, Ratan Singh not being an eye witness may be ruled out.
As to the remaining witnesses, we are on the whole inclined to agree with the view expressed by the Sessions Judge.
According to the Sessions Judge, the manner in which Deva Sukh was brought into the picture and the circumstances attendant on his evidence, furnish strong reasons.
for rejecting the prosecution version.
What has been held is that the whole case of the prosecution 26 198 that Deva Sukh had received injuries in the course of the alleged occurrence was false and his injuries ""were made up so as to create evidence of private defence"" to be utilized by the prosecution to meet the charge of having caused injuries to the members of the appellants ' party.
It has been established that at least four persons on the side of the accused had received injuries.
Mahindarpal had received no less than 16 injuries, and his condition was serious for some time.
Karan Singh had 12 injuries, one of which was grievous.
Hari Singh had received 7 injuries including a grievous injury, and Nikka Singh also was injured, his injury having been noticed by the investigating sub inspec tor.
In the prosecution evidence, it was stated that many of the accused persons were armed with lathis and had used them, and it would be strange if it was not proved that any of the persons on their side had any injuries attributable to lathis.
It has been established that the four injured persons of Ratan Singh 's party, viz., Rajpal Singh, Lakhan Singh, Behari Singh and Zorawar Singh, had only gun shot wounds.
A serious question which arises in this case is at what stage the gun was used, and whether it was used in self defence after the members of the appellants ' party were assaulted with lathis or it was used before they were as saulted.
The prosecution witnesses had to admit that at first a gun was fired twice in the air and then the actual firing took place.
This version of the firing lends support to the defence story that the gun was fired in self defence when Ratan Singh 's men attacked members of the accused 's party.
The Sessions Judge has expressed the view that in order to meet the defence case the prosecution introduced the story of Deva Sukh having been assaulted with a lathi in the first instance so as to make the appellants ' party the aggressors, it being the prosecution case that Behari Singh and his men had used lathis in order to defend themselves.
In order to resolve the conflict in the cases of the parties and to get at the true picture, the 199 Sessions Judge went very minutely into the question as to whether there was trustworthy evidence about Deva Sukh having received any injury at all in the occurrence.
It seems to us that there is a formidable array of circum stances to support the conclusion ultimately reached by the Sessions Judge.
It appears that in the first information report there is no reference to Deva Sukh or to the injuries said to have been received by him.
The Sessions Judge has pointed out that there was a considerable interval of time between the occurrence and the lodging of the first informa tion report, and therefore it is surprising that the most important incident of the occurrence and the name of the most important witness was omitted in the report.
Again, no reference was made to Deva Sukh or to his injuries in the dying declaration of Behari Singh which was recorded by one Dr. Shankar Deo, and also in that of Lakhan Singh.
The Sessions Judge has further pointed out that the prosecution witnesses, Chokha, Prempal, Cheta and Gangola Singh, who were examined by the investigating officer on the 18th June, did not also refer to Deva Sukh.
The investigating sub inspector was informed of the injuries on Deva Sukh and his presence at the time of the occurrence for the first time on the 19th June, 1945, and Deva Sukh 's explanation for not appearing before him at the earliest opportunity was that he was frightened and had concealed himself in his house for about two days and had directed his relations not to inform the police of his presence.
He also stated that on his arrival in his house after the occurrence he did not inform his relations of what had happened.
Some of these matters might have been overlooked if there had been convincing evidence about his having actually received injuries, but we are satisfied that such evidence as is before us is extreme ly unsatisfactory and suspicious and we entertain grave doubts as to whether Deva Sukh received any injuries at all.
Dr. Shanker Deo, who examined Deva Sukh, is a retired Sub Assistant Surgeon practising in Kauiraganj, which is not far from village Shahgarh.
200 He admits that he had known Ratan Singh since his childhood, and when he was a child he used to be taught at the house of Ratan Singh by a teacher employed by Ratan Singh 's uncle.
He has stated that Deva Sukh had two bruises across the back of the middle of the left forearm, and one of them was grievous since the left ulna was fractured.
He further says that at the time of examination he did charge fees from Deva Sukh, that he was brought to him three days after the other injured persons, that when the latter group of persons came to him none of them told him that there was one more injured person to be examined, and that Deva Sukh was brought to him by Ratan Singh 's servant.
There are unsatisfactory fea tures in the evidence of this doctor relating to other matters which need not be referred to, but what is somewhat remarkable is that though there is a District Board Hospital at Jalali about four miles from Kauirganj, Deva Sukh did not obtain an injury certificate from the doctor in charge of that hospital.
Deva Sukh says that he did go to that hospi tal to have his injuries attended to, but there is no evi dence to corroborate this.
These facts as well as a number of other facts relied upon by the Sessions Judge do go to support his theory, and once it is held that the prosecution has to rely on fabricated evidence, it throws doubts on the entire case.
From the record, it appears that Surajpal Singh was the person who had been taking an active interest in the eject ment suit, and he was admittedly spending money.
Ratan Singh says that he had also paid money to Surajpal Singh towards the expenditure, but this is not probable because he and Surajpal had been on bad terms.
It is admitted that Suraj pal is the person to whom the Amin gave possession of the land, but in spite of this fact, Ratan Singh 's men started operations on the land ignoring Bhagwati Kuer, which Ratan Singh had no right to do, even assuming that the land was joint property.
If Behari Singh and the other men sent by Ratan Singh were trying to take exclusive possession of the land and had started 201 operations thereon, Surajpal Singh had every right to pro test, and if his men were beaten first, of which there are strong indications in the case, he was entitled ' to repel the attack in exercise of the right of private defence.
That Ratan Singh had made ample preparations through Behari Singh is quite clear.
Admittedly, there were a number of persons armed with lathis present at the scene on his behalf including outsiders like Nawab Mewati, who is said to have been a well known fighter, Zorawar and others.
As regards the remaining two witnesses, to whom the High Court has made reference, viz., Rori Singh and Pransukh, it seems to us that the High Court has overlooked the comments made by the Sessions Judge upon their evidence, some of which are of considerable force.
What has impressed us is that they were not independent witnesses and were not mentioned in the first information report as witnesses to the occurrence, and they were examined by the sub inspector as late as the 20th and 21st June, 1945.
After reading the two judgments, we see no reason why the opinion of the Sessions Judge regarding these witnesses should not receive the weight which should normally be attached to that of the trial court.
It is well established that in an appeal under section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the High Court has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquit tal was founded, but it is equally well settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused is further rein forced by his acquittal by the trial court, and the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence can be reversed only for very substantial and compelling reasons.
On the whole, we are inclined to hold that the Sessions Judge had taken a reasonable view of the facts of the case, and in our opinion there were no good reasons for reversing that view.
The assessors with whose aid the trial was held, were unanimously of the opinion that the accused were not guilty, and 202 though 25 persons were placed on trial on identical evi dence, the State Government preferred an appeal only against 5 of them on the sole ground that the acquittal was against the weight of evidence on the record.
In the result, we allow the appeal, set aside the con viction and sentences of the appellants and acquit them of all the charges.
Appeal allowed.
","It is well settled that in an appeal under section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the High Court has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded.
But it is equally well settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused is further reinforced by his acquittal by the trial Court and the findings of the trial Court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence can be reversed only for very sub stantial and compelling reasons.

December 21.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by PATANJALI SASTRI.C.J.
This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution for the enforcement of the petition er 's fundamental rights under article 19 (1) (f) and article 31(1) alleged to have been violated by the Central Bank of India Ltd., a company incorporated under the Indian Compa nies Act, 1882, and having its registered office at Bombay, (hereinafter referred to as ""the Bank"").
It appears that the petitioner held five shares in the Share capital of the Bank which sold those shales to a 51 392 third party in purported exercise of its right of lien for recovery of a debt due to it from the petitioner, and the transfer was registered in the books of the Bank in the year 1937.
The petitioner thereupon instituted a series of pro ceedings in the High Court at Bombay on its original and appellate jurisdiction challenging the validity of the said sale and transfer.
The latest of these proceedings was a suit filed against the Bank in 1951 wherein the plaint was rejected on 2nd March, 1951, under Order 7, Rule 11 (d), of the Code of Civil Procedure as barred by limitation.
The petitioner now prays that all the adverse orders made in the previous proceedings be quashed and the said High Court be directed to have ""the above suit set down to be heard as undefended and pronounce judgment against the respondent or to make such orders as it thinks fit in relation to the said suit"".
It may be mentioned here that though the aforesaid order rejecting the petitioner 's plaint was appealable, the petitioner did not prefer an appeal on the somewhat extraor dinary ground that ""the appeal if filed could not be heard by the Judges of the said Court as all of them were disqual ified from hearing such appeal"" either because of their interest in the Bank or because of their prejudice against him.
We are of opinion that the petitioner has misconceived his remedy and the petition must fail on a preliminary ground.
Neither article 19 (1) (f) nor article 31 (1) on its true construction was intended to prevent wrongful individual acts or to provide protection against merely private conduct.
Article 19 deals with the ""right to free dom"" and by clause (1) assures to the citizen certain funda mental freedoms including the freedom ""to acquire, hold and dispose of property"" subject to the power of the State to impose restrictions on the exercise of such rights to the extent and on the grounds mentioned in clauses (2) to (6).
The language and structure of article 19 and its setting in Part III of the Constitution clearly show that the article was intended to protect those freedoms against State action other than in the legitimate exercise of its power to regu late private rights in the public interest, 393 Violation of rights of property by individuals is not within the purview of the article.
The position is no better under article 31 (1).
The petitioner has urged that clause (1) should be construed apart from and independently of the rest of the article and, if so construed, its language is wide enough to cover in fringements of rights of property by private individuals.
He laid emphasis on the omission of the word ""State"" in clause (1) while it was used in clause (2) of the same article as well as in many other articles in Part III.
Referring to entry No. 33 of the Union List, entry No. 36 of the State List and entry No, 42 of the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution, he also argued that, while these entries read with article 246 empowered Parliament and the State Legislatures to make laws regarding acquisition or requisitioning of property for the purposes of the Union or the State as the case may be.
no power was conferred to make laws regarding ""deprivation of property"" by the State, so that the ""deprivation"" contemplated in clause (1) could only be deprivation by individuals.
Sub section (1) of section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935, corresponding to clause (1) of article a 1 was, it was pointed out, omitted in the draft article 19 (later numbered as article 81) which retained in a modified form only the provision contained in sub section (2) of that section relating to compulsory acquisition of property for public purposes.
But, clause (1) was subsequently restored and article was enacted in its present form as recommended in Drafting Committee 's Report and this, it was claimed, showed that clause (1) was intended to operate as a distinct provi sion apart from clause (2).
We see no force in any of these arguments.
In support of the argument that clause (1 ) should be construed in isolation from the rest of the article, the petitioner relied on certain observations of our learned brother Das in Chiranjit Lal vs The Union of India (1), where the view was expressed that clause (1)enunciated the general principle that no person should be deprived (1) [1950] S.C,R,. 860.
394 of his property except by authority of law and laid down no condition for payment of compensation, while clause (2) dealt with deprivation of property brought about by acquisi tion or taking possession of it and required payment of compensation.
In other words, deprivation referred to in clause(1) must be taken to cover deprivation otherwise than by acquisition or requisitioning of property dealt with in clause (2).
We consider it unnecessary for the purpose of the present petition to go into that question.
Even assuming that clause (1) has to be read and construed apart from clause (2), it is clear that it is a declaration of the fundamental right of private property in the same negative form in which article 21 declares the fundamental right to life and liberty.
There is no express reference to the State in article 21.
But could it be suggested on that account that that article was intended to afford protection to life and personal liberty against violation by private individuals ? The words ""except by procedure established by law"" plainly exclude such a suggestion.
Similarly, the words ""save by authority of law"" in clause (1) of article 31 show that it is a prohibition of unauthorised governmental action against private property, as there can be no question of one private individual being authorised by law to deprive anoth er of his property.
The argument based on the entries in the Lists is fallacious.
It is not correct to suggest that, merely be cause there is no entry in the Lists of the Seventh Schedule relating to ""deprivation of property"" as such, it is not within the competence of the legislatures in the country to enact a law authorising deprivation of property.
Such a law could be made, for instance, under entry No. 1 of List II, entry No. 1 of List II or entry No. 1 of List III.
Article 31 (1) itself contemplates a law being passed authorising deprivation of the properties, and it is futile to deny the existence of the requisite legislative power.
Nor does the legislative history of the article lend any support to the petitioner 's contention.
Section 299 395 (1) of the Government of India Act, 1935, was never inter preted as prohibiting deprivation of property by private individuals.
Its restoration, therefore, in the same form in article 31, after omission in the original draft article 19, could lead to no inference in support c. of the peti tioner 's contention, which indeed proceeds on the fundamen tal misconception that article 19(1)(f) and article 31 (1), which are great constitutional safeguards against State aggression on private property, are directed against in fringements by private individuals for which remedies should be sought in the ordinary law.
In this view it is unnecessary to deal with certain other objections to the maintainability of the petition raised by the Solicitor General on behalf of the Bank.
The petition is dismissed.
We make no order as to costs.
Petition dismissed.
","Article 19(1)(f) of the Constitution is clearly intended to protect the freedom to acquire, hold and dispose of property against State action other than in the legitimate exercise of its power to regulate private rights in the public interest.
Similarly, article S1(1) provides a safe guard against deprivation of property by the State except by procedure established by law.
Violation of rights of property by private individuals is not within the purview of those articles.
A person whose rights of property are infringed by a private individual must therefore seek his remedy under the ordinary law and not by way of an application under article 32.

November 8.
The judgment 0 the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.
These two applications for enforcement of the fundamental right guaranteed under article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India have been made by a proprietor and an employee respectively of a bidi manufacturing concern of District Sagar (State of Madhya Pradesh).
It is contended that the law in force in the State authorizing it to prohib it the manufacture of bidis in certain villages including the one 761 wherein the applicants reside is inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution and is conse quently void.
The Central Provinces and Berar Regulation of Manufac ture of Bidis (Agricultural Purposes) Act, LXIV of 1948, was passed on 19th October 1948 and was the law in force in the State at the commencement of the Constitution.
Sections 3 and 4 of the Act are in these terms; "" 3.
The Deputy Commissioner may by notification fix a period to be an agricultural season with respect to such villages as may be specified therein.
(1) The Deputy Commissioner may, by general order which shall extend to such villages as he may specify, prohibit the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season.
(2) No person residing in a village specified in such order shall during the agricultural season engage himself in the manufacture of bidis, and no manufacturer shall during the said season employ any person for the manufacture of bidis.
"" On the 13th June 1950 an order was issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Sagar under the provisions of the Act for bidding all persons residing in certain villages from engag ing in the manufacture of bidis.
On the 19th June 1950 these two petitions were presented to this Court under article 32 of the Constitution challenging the validity of the order as it prejudicially affected the petitioners ' right of freedom of occupation and business.
During the pendency of the petitions the season mentioned in the order of the 13th June ran out.
A fresh order for the ensuing agricultural season 8th October to 18th November 1950 was issued on 29th September 1950 in the same terms.
This order was also challenged in a supplementary petition.
Article 19 (1) (g) runs as follows : ""All citizens shall have the right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or busi ness.
"" 762 The article guarantees freedom of occupation and busi ness.
The freedom guaranteed herein is, however, subject to the limitations imposed by clause (6) of article 19.
That clause is in these terms : ""Nothing in sub clause (g) of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes, or prevent the State from making any law imposing, in the interests of the general public, reasonable restric tions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause, and, in particular, nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it prescribes or empowers any authority to prescribe, or prevent the State from making any law prescribing or empowering any authority to prescribe, the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any pro fession or carrying on any occupation, trade or business.
"" The point for consideration in these applications is whether the Central Provinces and Berar Act LXIV of 1948 comes within the ambit of this saving clause or is in excess of its provisions.
The learned counsel for the petitioners contends that the impugned Act does not impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the fundamental right in the interests of the general public but totally negatives it.
In order to judge the validity of this contention it is neces sary to examine the impugned Act and some of its provisions.
In the preamble to the Act, it is stated that it has been enacted to provide measures for the supply of adequate labour for agricultural purposes in bidi manufacturing areas.
Sections 3 and 4 cited above empower the Deputy Commissioner to prohibit the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season.
The contravention of any of these provisions is made punishable by section 7 of the Act, the penalty being imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine or with both.
It was enacted to help in the grow more food campaign and for the purpose of bring ing under the plough considerable areas of fallow land.
The question for decision is whether the statute under the guise of protecting public interests arbitrarily 763 interferes with private business and imposes unreasonable and unnecessarily restrictive regulations upon lawful occupation; in other words, whether the total prohibition of carrying on the business of manufacture of bidis within the agricultural season amounts to a reasonable restriction on the fundamental rights mentioned in article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution.
Unless it is shown that there is a reason able relation of the provisions of the Act to the purpose in view, the right of freedom of occupation and business cannot be curtailed by it.
The phrase ""reasonable restriction"" connotes that the limitation imposed on a person in enjoyment of the right should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature, beyond what is required in the interests of the public.
The word ""reasonable"" implies intelligent care and deliberation, that is, the choice of a course which reason dictates.
Legisla tion which arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness and unless it strikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed in article 19 (1) (g) and the social control permitted by clause (6) of article 19, it must be held to be wanting in that quality.
Clause (6) in the concluding paragraph particularizes certain instances of the nature of the restrictions that were in the mind of the constitution makers and which have the quality of reasonableness.
They afford a guide to the interpretation of the clause and illustrate the extent and nature of the restrictions which according to the statute could be imposed on the freedom guaranteed in clause (g).
The statute in substance and effect suspends altogether the right mentioned in article 19 (1) (g) during the agri cultural seasons and such suspension may lead to such dislocation of the industry as to prove its ultimate ruin.
The object of the statute is to provide measures for the supply of adequate labour for agricultural purposes in bidi manufacturing areas of the Province and it could well be achieved by legislation restraining the employment of agri cultural labour in the manufacture 764 of bidis during the agricultural season.
Even in point of time a restriction may well have been reasonable if it amounted to a regulation of the hours of work in the busi ness.
Such legislation though it would limit the field for recruiting persons for the manufacture of bidis and regulate the hours of the working of the industry, would not have amounted to a complete stoppage of the business of manufac ture and might well have been within the ambit of clause (6).
The effect of the provisions of the Act, however, has no reasonable relation to the object in view but is so drastic in scope that it goes much in excess of that object.
Not only are the provisions of the statute in excess of the requirements of the case but the language employed prohibits a manufacturer of bidis from employing any person m his business, no matter wherever that person may be residing.
In other words, a manufacturer of bidis residing in this area cannot import labour from neighbouring places in the district or province or from outside the province.
Such a prohibition on the face of it is of an arbitrary nature inasmuch as it has no relation whatsoever to the object which the legislation seeks to achieve and as such cannot be said to be a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right.
Further the statute seeks to prohibit all persons residing in the notified villages during the agricultural season from engaging themselves in the manufacture of bidis.
It cannot be denied that there would be a number of infirm and disabled persons, a number of children, old women and petty shop keepers residing in these villages who are inca pable of being used for agricultural labour.
All such persons are prohibited by law from engaging themselves in the manufacture of bidis; and are thus being deprived of earning their livelihood.
It is a matter of common knowledge that there are certain classes of persons residing in every village who do not engage in agricultural operations.
They and their womenfolk and children in their leisure hours supplement their income by engaging themselves in bidi business.
There seems no reason for prohibiting them from carrying on this occupation, The statute as 765 it stands, not only compels those who can be engaged in agricultural work from not taking to other avocations, but it also prohibits persons who have no connection or relation to agricultural operations from engaging in the business of bidi making and thus earning their livelihood.
These provi sions of the statute, in our opinion, cannot be said to amount to reasonable restrictions on the right of the appli cants and that being so, the statute is not in conformity with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution.
The law even to the extent that it could be said to authorize the imposition of restrictions in regard to agricultural labour cannot be held valid because the language employed is wide enough to cover restrictions both within and without the limits of constitutionally permissible legislative action affecting the right.
So long as the possibility of its being applied for purposes not sanctioned by the Consti tution cannot be ruled out, it must be held to be wholly void.
Mr. Sikri for the Government of Madhya Pradesh contends that the legislature of Madhya Pradesh was the proper judge of the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the statute, that that legislature alone knew the conditions prevailing in the State and it alone could say what kind of legislation could effectively achieve the end in view and would help in the grow more food campaign and would help for bringing in fallow land under the plough and that this Court sitting at this great distance could not judge by its own yardstick of reason whether the restrictions imposed in the circumstances of the case were reasonable or not.
This argument runs counter to the clear provisions of the Con stitution.
The determination by the legislature of what constitutes a reasonable restriction is not final or conclu sive;it is subject to the supervision by this Court.
In the matter of fundamental rights, the Supreme Court watches and guards the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and in exercising its functions it has the power to set aside an Act of the Legislature if it is in violation of the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.
We are therefore of opinion 98 766 that the impugned statute does not stand the test of reason ableness and is therefore void.
The result therefore is that the orders issued by the Deputy Commissioner on 13th June 1950 and 26th September 1950 are void, inoperative and ineffective.
We therefore direct the respondents not to enforce the provisions con tained in section 4 of the Act against the petitioners in any manner whatsoever.
The petitioners will have their costs of these proceedings in the two petitions.
Petitions allowed.

","The Central Provinces and Berar Regulation of Manufac ture of Bidis (Agricultural Purposes) Act, LXIV of 1948, a law which was in force at the commencement of the Constitu tion of India, provided that"" the Deputy Commissioner may by notification fix a period to be an agricultural season with respect to such villages as may be specified therein"" and that ""the Deputy Commissioner may by general order which shall extend to such villages as he may specify, prohibit the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season.
"" The Act provided further that"" no person residing in a, village specified in such order shall during the agricultur al season engage himself in the manufacture of bidis, and no manufacturer shall during the said season employ any person for the manufacture of bidis."" An order was issued by the Deputy Commissioner under the provisions of the Act forbid ding all persons residing in certain villages from engaging in the manufacture of bidis during a. particular season.
A manufacturer of bidis and an employee in a bidi factory residing in one of the said villages applied under article 32 of the Constitution for a writ of mandamus alleging that since the Act prohibited the petitioners from exercising their fundamental right to carry on their trade or business which was guaranteed to them by cl.
(1) (g) of article 19 of the Constitution, the Act was void: Held, (i) that the object of the statute, namely, to provide measures for the supply of adequate labour for agricultural purposes in bidi manufacturing areas of the Province could well have been achieved by legislation re straining the employment of agricultural labour in the manufacture of bidis during the agriculrural season without prohibiting altogether the manufacture of bidis.
As the provisions of the Act had no reasonable relation 760 to the object in view, the Act was not a law imposing ""reasonable restrictions"" within the meaning of cl.
(6) of Art 19 and was therefore void.
(ii) The law even to the extent that it could be said to authorize the imposition of restrictions in regard to agri cultural labour cannot be held to be valid because the language employed was wide enough to cover restrictions both within and without the limits of constitutionally permissi ble legislative action affecting the right, and so long as the possibility of its being applied for purposes not sanc tioned by the Constitution cannot be ruled out, it must be held to be wholly void.
The phrase ""reasonable restriction"" connotes that the limitation imposed on a person in enjoyment of the right should not be arbitrary or of an excessive nature, beyond what is required in the interests of the public.
The word ""reasonable"" implies intelligent care and deliberation, that is, the choice of a course which reason dictates.
Legisla tion which arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness and unless it strikes a proper balance between the freedom guarnteed in article 19 (1) (g) and the social control permit ted by el.
(6) of article 19, it must be held to be wanting in that quality.
Held also, that the determination by the Legislature of what constitutes a reasonable restriction is not final and conclusive.
The Supreme Court has power to consider whether the restrictions imposed by the Legislature are reasonable within the meaning of article 19, cl.
(6) and to declare the law void if in its opinion the restrictions are not reasonable.

agreed with Fazl Ali 5.
221 FAZL ALI J.
This is an appeal from an order of the Madras High Court dismissing the petition of the appellant praying for a writ of certiorari.
The appellant was one of the persons who had filed nomination papers for election to the Madras Legislative Assembly from the Namakkal Constituency in Salem district.
On the 28th November, 1951, the Returning Officer for that constituency took up for scrutiny the nomination papers filed by the various candidates and on the same day he rejected the appellant 's nomination paper on certain grounds which need not be set out as they are not material to the point raised in this appeal.
The appellant thereupon moved the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution praying for a writ of of certiorari to quash the order of the Re turning Officer rejecting his nomination paper and to direct the Returning Officer to include his name in the list of valid nominations to be published.
The High Court dismissed the appellant 's application on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to interfere with the order of the Returning Officer by reason of the provisions of article 329(b) of the Constitution.
The appellant 's contention in this appeal is that the view expressed by the High Court is not correct, that the jurisdiction of the High Court is not affected by article 329 (b) of the Constitution and that he was enti tled to a writ of certiorari in the circumstances of the case.
Broadly speaking, the arguments on which the judgment of the High Court is assailed are two fold : (1) that the conclusion arrived at by the High Court does not follow from the language of article 329 (b) of the Constitution, whether that article is read by itself or along with the other articles in Part XV of the Constitu tion; and (2) that the anomalies which will arise if the construc tion put by the High Court on article 329 (b) is accepted, are so startling that the courts should lean in favour of the construction put forward on behalf of the appellant.
29 222 The first argument which turns on the construction of article 329 (b) requires serious consideration, but I think the second argument can be disposed of briefly at the out set.
It should be stated that what the appellant chooses to call anomaly can be more appropriately described as hardship or prejudice and what their nature will be has been stated in forceful language by Wallace J. in Sarvothama Rao vs Chairman, Municipal Council, Saidapet (1) in these words : ""I am quite clear that any post election remedy is wholly inadequate to afford the relief which the petitioner seeks, namely, that this election, now published be stayed, until it can be held with himself as a candidate.
It is no conso lation to tell him that he can stand for some other elec tion.
It is no remedy to tell him that he must let the election go on and then have it set aside by petition and have a fresh election ordered.
The fresh election may be under altogether different conditions and may bring forward an array of fresh candidates.
The petitioner can only have his proper relief if the proposed election without him is stayed until his rejected nomination is restored, and hence an injunction staying this election was absolutely neces sary, unless the relief asked for was to be denied him altogether in limine.
In most cases of this kind no doubt there will be difficulty for the aggrieved party to get in his suit in time before the threatened wrong is committed; but when he has succeeded in so doing, the Court cannot stultify itself by allowing the wrong which it is asked to prevent to be actually consummated while it is engaged in trying the suit.
"" These observations however represent only one side of the picture and the same learned Judge presented the other side of the picture in a subsequent case [Desi Chettiar vs Chinnasami Chettiar(2)] in the following passage : ""The petitioner is not without his remedy.
His remedy lies in an election petition which we understand he has already put in.
It is argued for him (1) mad. 585 at 600.
(2) at 1272.
that that remedy which merely allows him to have set aside an election once held is not as efficacious as the one which would enable him to stop the election altogether;and certain observations at p. 600 of Sarvothama Rao vs Chairman, Munic ipal Council, Saidapet(1) are quoted.
In the first place, we do not see how the mere fact that the petitioner cannot get the election stopped and has his remedy only after it is over by an election petition, will in itself confer on him any right to obtain a writ.
In the second place, these observations were directed to the consideration of the propriety of an injunction in a civil suit, a matter with which we are not here concerned.
And finally it may.
be observed that these remarks were made some years ago when the practice of individuals coming forward to stop elections in order that their own individual interest may be safe guarded was not so common.
It is clear that there is anoth er side of the question to be considered, namely, the incon venience to the public administration of having elections and the business of Local Boards held up while individuals prosecute their individual grievances.
We understand the election for the elective seats in this Union has been held up since 31st May because of this petition, the result being that the electors have been unable since then to have any representation on the Board, and the Board is functioning, if indeed it is functioning, with a mere nominated fraction of its total strength; and this state of affairs the peti tioner proposes to have continued until his own personal grievance is satisfied."" These observations which were made in regard to elec tions to Local Boards will apply with greater force to elections to legislatures, because it does not require much argument to show that in a country with a democratic consti tution in which the legislatures have to play a very impor tant role, it will lead to serious consequences, if the elections are unduly proracted or obstructed.
To this aspect of the matter I shall have to advert later.
but it is suffi cient for the present purpose (1) Mad, 585 at 600.
224 to state firstly that in England the hardship and inconven ience which may be suffered by an individual candidate has not been regarded as of sufficient weight to induce Parlia ment to make provision for immediate relief and the ag grieved candidate has to wait until after the election to challenge the validity of the rejection of his nomina tion paper, and secondly, that the question of hardship or inconvenience is after all only a secondary question, be cause if the construction put by the High Court on article 329 (b) of the Constitution is found to be correct, the fact that such construction will lead to hardship and inconven ience becomes irrelevant.
Article 329 is the last article in Part XV of the Constitution, the heading of which is ""Elections"", and it runs as follows : ""Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution (a) the validity of any law relating to the delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such constit uencies, made or purporting to be made under article 327 or article 328, shall not be called in question in any court; (b) no election to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the Legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for, by, or under any law made by the appropriate Legislature.
"" In construing this article, reference was made by both parties in the course of their arguments to the other arti cles in the same Part, namely, articles 324, 325, 326, 327 and 328.
Article 324 provides for the constitution and appointment of an Election Commissioner to superintend, direct and control ejections to the legislatures; article 325 prohibits discrimination against electors on the ground of religion, race, caste or sex; article 326 provides for adult suffrage; article 327 empowers Parliament to pass laws making provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections to the legislatures, subject 225 to the provisions of the Constitution; and article 328 is a complementary article giving power to the State Legislature to make provision with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections to the State Legislature.
A notable difference in the language used in articles 327 and 328 on the one hand, and article 329 on the other, is that while the first ' two articles begin with the words"" subject to the provisions of this Constitution"" the last article begins with the words ""notwithstanding anything in this Constitution.
"" It was conceded at the bar that the effect of this difference in language is that whereas any law made by Parliament under article 327, or by the State Legislatures under article 328, cannot exclude the jurisdic tion of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitu tion, that jurisdiction is excluded in regard to matters provided for in article 329.
Now, the main controversy in this appeal centres round the meaning of the words ""no election shall be called in question except by an election petition"" in article 329 (b), and the point to be decided is whether questioning the action of the Returning Officer in rejecting a nomination paper can be said to be comprehended within the words, ""no election shall be called in question.
"" The appellant 's case is that questioning something which has happened before a candidate is declared elected is not the same thing as questioning an election, and the arguments advanced on his behalf in support of this construction were these: (1) That the word ""election"" as used in article 329 (b) means what it normally and etymologically means, namely, the result of polling or the final selection of a candidate; (2) That the fact that an election petition can be filed only after polling is over or after a candidate is declared elected, and what is normally called in question by such petition is the final result, bears out the conten tion that the word ""election ""can have no other meaning in article (b) than the result of polling or the final selec tion of a candidate; 226 (3) That the words ""arising out of or in connection with"" which are used in article 324 (1) and the words ""with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with"" which are used in articles 327 and s28, show that the fram ers of the Constitution knew that it was necessary to use different language when referring respectively to matters which happen prior to and after the result of polling, and if they had intended to include the rejection of a nomina tion paper within the ambit of the prohibition contained in article S29 (b) they would have used similar language in that article and (4) That the action of the Returning Officer in reject ing a nomination paper can be questioned before the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution for the follow ing reason: Scrutiny of nomination papers and their rejec tion are provided for in section 36 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
Parliament has made this provision in exercise of the powers conferred on it by article 327 of the Constitution which is ""subject to the provisions of the Constitution"".
Therefore, the action of the Returning Offi cer is subject to the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226.
These arguments appear at first sight to be quite im pressive, but in my opinion there are weightier and basical ly more important arguments in support of the view taken by the High Court.
As we have seen, the most important ques tion for determination is the meaning to be given to the word ""election"" in article 329 (b).
That word has by long usage in connection with the process of selection of proper representatives in democratic institutions, acquired both a wide and a narrow meaning.
In the narrow sense, it is used to mean the final selection of a candidate which may em brace the result of the poll when there is polling or a particular candidate being returned unopposed when there is no poll.
In the wide sense, the word is used to connote the entire process culminating in a candidate being declared 227 elected.
In Srinivasalu vs Kuppuswami(1), the learned Judges of the Madras High Court after examining the question, expressed the opinion that the term ""election"" may be taken to embrace the whole procedure whereby an ""elected member"" is returned, whether or not it be found necessary to take a poll.
With this view, my brother, Maimjan J. expressed his agreement in Sat Narain vs Hanuman Prasad (2); and I also find myself in agreement with it.
It seems to me that the word ""election"" has been used in Part XV of the Constitution in the wide sense, that is to say, to connote the entire procedure to be gone through to return a candidate to the legislature.
The use of the expression ""conduct of elections"" in article 324 specifically points to the wide meaning, and that meaning can also be read consistently into the other provisions which occur in Part XV including article 329 (b).
That the word ""election"" bears this wide meaning whenever we talk of elections in a democratic country, is borne out by the fact that in most of the books on the subject and in several cases dealing with the matter, one of the questions mooted is, when the election begins.
The subject is dealt with quite concisely in Halsbury 's Laws of England in the following passage(s) under the heading"" Commencement of the Election "": ""Although the first formal step in every election is the issue of the writ, the election is considered for some purposes to begin at an earlier date.
It is a question of fact in each case when an election begins in such a way as to make the parties concerned responsible for breaches of election law, the test being whether the contest is ""reason ably imminent"".
Neither the issue of the writ nor the publi cation of the notice of election can be looked to as fixing the date when an election begins from this point of view.
Nor, again, does the nomination day afford any criterion.
The election will usually begin at least earlier than the issue of the writ.
The question when the election begins must be care (1) at 255.
(2) (3) See page 237 of Halsbury 's Laws of England, 2nd edition, Volume 12.
228 fully distinguished from that as to when ""the conduct and management of"" an election may be said to begin.
Again, the question as to when a particular person commences to be a candidate is a question to be considered in each case.
"" The discussion in this passage makes it clear that the word ' 'election"" can be and has been appropriately used with reference to the entire process which consists of several stages and embraces many steps, some of which may have an important bearing on the result of the process.
The next important question to be considered is what is meant by the words ""no election shall be called in ques tion"".
A reference to any treatise on elections in England will show that an election proceeding in that country is liable to be assailed on very limited grounds, one of them being the improper rejection of a nomination paper.
The law with which we are concerned is not materially different, and we find that in section 100 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, one of the grounds for declaring an elec tion to be void is the improper rejection of a nomination paper.
The question now arises whether the law of elections in this country contemplates that there should be two attacks on matters connected with election proceedings, one while they are going on by invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution (the ordinary jurisdiction of the courts having been expressly excluded), and another after they have been completed by means of an election petition.
In my opinion, to affirm such a position would be contrary to the scheme of Part XV of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, which, as I shall point out later, seems to be that any matter which has the effect of vitiating an election should be brought up only at the appropriate stage in an appropri ate manner before a special tribunal and should not be brought up at an intermediate stage before any court.
It seems to me that under the election law, the only signifi cance which the rejection of 229 a nomination paper has consists in the fact that it can be used as a ground to call the election in question.
Arti cle 329(b)was apparently enacted to prescribe the manner in which and the stage at which this ground, and other grounds which may be raised under the law to call the election in question could be urged.
I think it follows by necessary implication from the language of this provision that those grounds cannot be urged in any other manner, at any other stage and before any other court.
If the grounds on which an election can be called in question could be raised at an earlier stage and errors, if any, are rectified, there will be no meaning in enacting a provision like article 329 (b) and in setting up a special tribunal.
Any other meaning ascribed to the words used in the article would lead to anomalies, which the Constitution could not have contemplat ed, one of them being that conflicting views may be ex pressed by the High Court at the pre polling stage and by the election tribunal, which is to be an independent body, at the stage when the matter is brought up before it.
I think that a brief examination of the scheme of Part XV of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act, 1951, will show that the construction I have suggested is the correct one.
Broadly speaking, before an election machinery can be brought into operation, there are three requisites which require to be attended to, namely, (1) there should be a set of laws and rules making provisions with respect to all matters relating to, or in connection with, elections, and it should be decided as to how these laws and rules are to be made;(2) there should be an execu tive charged with the duty of securing the due conduct of elections; and (3)there should be a judicial tribunal to deal with disputes arising out of or in connection with elections.
Articles 327 and 328 deal with the first of these requisites, article 324 with the second and article 329 with the third requisite.
The other two articles in Part XV, viz, articles 325 and 326, deal with two matters of princi ple to which the Constitution framers have attached much importance.
They 30 230 are : (1) prohibition against discrimination in the prepa ration of, or eligibility for inclusion in, the electoral rolls, on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or any of them; and (2) adult suffrage.
Part XV of the Constitution is really a code in itself providing the entire ground work for enacting appropriate laws and setting up suitable ma chinery for the conduct of elections.
The Representation of the People Act, 1951, which was passed by Parliament under article 327 of the Constitution.
makes detailed provisions in regard to all matters and all stages connected with elections to the various legislatures in this country.
That Act is divided into II parts, and it is interesting to see the wide variety of subjects they deal with.
Part Il deals with ""the qualifications and disquali fications for membership"", Part III deals with the notifica tion of General Elections, Part IV provides for the adminis trative machinery for the conduct of elections, and Part V makes provisions for the actual conduct of elections and deals with such matters as presentation of nomination pa pers.
requirements of a valid nomination, scrutiny of nomi nations, etc., and procedure for polling and counting of votes.
Part VI deals with disputes regarding elections and provides for the manner of presentation of election peti tions, the constitution of election tribunals and the trial of election petitions.
Part VII outlines the various cor rupt and illegal practices which may affect the elections, and electoral offences.
Obviously, the Act is a self contained enactment so far as elections are concerned, which means that whenever we have to ascertain the true position in regard to any matter connected with elections, we have only to look at the Act and the rules made thereunder.
The provisions of the Act which are material to the present discussion are sections 80, 100, 105 and 170, and the provi sions of Chapter II of Part IV dealing with the form of election petitions, their contents and the reliefs which may be sought in them.
Section 80, which is drafted in almost the same language as article 329 (b), provides that ""no election shall be called in question except by an election 231 petition presented in accordance with the provisions of this Part"".
Section 100, as we have already seen, provides for the grounds on which an election may be called in question, one of which is the improper rejection of a nomination paper.
Section 105 says that ""every order of the Tribunal made under this Act shall be final and conclusive"".
Section 170 provides that ""no civil court shall have jurisdiction to question the legality of any action taken or of any decision given by the Returning Officer or by any other person appointed under this Act in connection with an elec tion.
"" These are the main provisions regarding election matters being judicially dealt with, and it should be noted that there is no provision anywhere to the effect that anything connected with elections can be questioned at an intermediate stage.
It is now well recognized that where a right or liability is created by a statute which gives a special remedy for en forcing it, the remedy provided by that statute only must be availed of.
This rule was stated with great clarity by Willes J. in Wolverhampton New Water Works Co. vs Hawkes ford(1) in the following passage : ""There are three classes of cases in which a liability may be established founded upon statute.
One is, where there was a liability existing at common law and that li ability is affirmed by a statute which gives a special and peculiar form of remedy different from the remedy which existed at common law;there, unless the statute contains words which expressly or by necessary implication exclude the common law remedy, the party suing has his election to pursue either that or the statutory remedy.
The second class of cases is, where the statute gives the right to suemerely, but provides no particular form of remedy: there, the party can only proceed by action at common law.
But there is a third class, viz., where a liability not existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it. .
The remedy provided by the statute must be followed, and it is not (1) ; , 356.
232 competent to the party to pursue the course applicable to cases of the second class.
The form given by the statute must be adopted and adhered to.
"" The rule laid down in this passage was approved by the House of Lords in Neville vs London Express Newspaper Limit ed(1) and has been reaffirmed by the Privy Council in Attorney General of Trinidad and Tobago vs Gordon Grant & Co.(2) and Secretary of State vs Mask & Co.(a); and it has also been held to be equally applicable to enforcement of rights: see Hurdutrai vs Official Assignee of Calcutta(4).
That being so, I think it will be a fair inference from the provisions of the Representation of the People Act to state that the Act provides for only one remedy, that remedy being by an election petition to be presented after the election is over, and there is no remedy provided at any intermediate stage.
It was argued that since the Representation of the People Act was enacted subject to the provisions of the Constitution, it cannot bar the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue writs under article 226 of the Constitution.
This argument however is completely shut out by reading the Act along with article 329 (b).
It will be noticed that the language used in that article and in section 80 of the Act is almost identical, with this difference only that the article is preceded by the words ""notwithstanding anything in this Constitution"".
I think that those words are quite apt to exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court to deal with any matter which may arise while the elections are in progress.
It may be stated that section 107(1) of the Representation of People Act, 1949 (12 & 13 Geo.
6, c. 68) in England is drafted almost in the same language as article 329(b).
That section runs thus : ""No parliamentary election and no return to Parliament shall be questioned except by a petition complaining of an undue election or undue return (hereinafter referred to as a parliamentary election petition) presented in accordance with this Part of this Act.
"" (1) (3) (2) [1935] A.C. 532.
(4) , 349.
233 It appears that similar language was used in the earlier statutes, and it is noteworthy that it has never been held in England that the improper rejection of a nomination paper can be the subject of a writ of certiorari or mandamus.
On the other hand, it was conceded at the bar that the ques tion of improper rejection of a nomination paper has always been brought up in that country before the appropriate tribunal by means of an election petition after the conclu sion of the election.
It is true that there is no direct decision holding that the words used in the relevant provi sions exclude the jurisdiction of the High Court to issue appropriate prerogative writs at an intermediate stage of the election, but the total absence of any such decision can be accounted for only on the view that the provisions in question have been generally understood to have that effect.
Our attention was drawn to rule 13 of the rules appended to the Ballot Act of 1872 and a similar rule in the Parliamen tary Elections Rules of 1949, providing that the decision of the Returning Officer disallowing an objection to a nomina tion paper shall be final, but allowing the same shall be subject to reversal on a petition questioning the election or return.
These rules however do not affect the main argument.
I think it can be legitimately stated that if words similar to those used in article 329 (b) have been consistently treated in England as words apt to exclude the jurisdiction of the courts including the High Court, the same consequence must follow from the words used in article 329 (b) of the Constitution.
The words ""notwithstanding anything in this Constitution"" give to that article the same wide and binding effect as a statute passed by a sover eign legislature like the English Parliament.
It may be pointed out that article 329 (b) must be read as complimentary to clause (a) of that article.
Clause (a) bars the jurisdiction of the courts with regard to such law as may be made under articles 327 and 328 relating to the delimitation of constituencies or the allotment of seats to such constituencies.
It was conceded before us that article 329 (b) ousts the jurisdiction of the courts with regard to matters 234 arising between the commencement of the polling and the final selection.
The question which has to be asked is what conceivable reason the legislature could have had to leave only matters connected with nominations subject to the jurisdiction of the High Court under article 226 of the Constitution.
If Part XV of the Constitution is a code by itself, i. e., it creates rights and provides for their enforcement by a special tribunal to the exclusion of all courts including the High Court, there can be no reason for assuming that the Constitution left one small part of the election process to be made the subject matter of contest before the High Courts and thereby upset the time schedule of the elections The more reasonable view seems to be that article 329 covers all ""electoral matters"".
The conclusions which I have arrived at may be summed up briefly as follows : (1) Having regard to the important functions which the legislatures have to perform in democratic countries, it has always been recognized to be a matter of first importance that elections should be concluded as early as possible according to time schedule and all controversial matters and all disputes arising out of elections should be postponed till after the elections are over, so that the election proceedings may not be unduly retarded or protracted.
(2) In conformity with this principle, the scheme the elec tion law in this country as well as in England is that no significance should be attached to anything which does not affect the ""election""; and if any irregularities are commit ted while it is in progress and they belong to the category or class which, under the law by which elections are gov erned, would have the effect of vitiating the ' 'election"" and enable the person affected to call it in question, they should be brought up before a special tribunal by means of an election petition and not be made the subject of a dis pute before any court while the election is in progress.
It will be useful at this stage to refer to the deci sion the Privy Council in Theberge vs Laudry(1).
The (1) 235 petitioner in that case having been declared duly elected a member to represent an electoral district in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, his election was after wards, on petition, declared null and void by judgment of the Superior Court, under the Quebec Controverted Elections Act, 1875, and himself declared guilty of corrupt practices both personally and by his agents.
Thereupon, he applied for special leave to appeal to Her Majesty in Council, but it was refused on the ground that the fair construction of the Act of 1875 and the Act of 1872 which preceded it providing among other things that the judgment of the Superior Court ""shall not be susceptible of appeal"" was that it was the intention of the legislature to create a tribunal for the purpose of trying election petitions in a manner which should make its decision final for all purposes, and should not annex to it the incident of its judgment being reviewed by the Crown under its prerogative.
In delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, Lord Cairns observed as follows : ""These two Acts of Parliament, the Acts of 1872 and 1875, are Acts peculiar in their character.
They are not Acts constituting or providing for the decision of mere ordinary civil rights; they are Acts creating an entirely new, and up to that time unknown, jurisdiction in a partic ular Court. for the purpose of taking out, with its own consent, of the Legislative Assembly, and vesting in that Court, that very peculiar jurisdiction which, up to that time, had existed in the Legislative Assembly of decid ing election petitions, and determining the: status of those who claimed to be members of the Legislative Assembly.
A jurisdiction of that kind is extremely special, and one of the obvious incidents or consequences of such a jurisdiction must be that the jurisdiction, by whomsoever it is to be exercised, should be exercised in a way that should as soon as possible become conclusive; and enable the constitution of the Legislative Assembly to be distinctly and speedily known.
"" 236 After dealing with certain other matters, the Lord ChanCellor proceeded to make the following further observa tions : ""Now, the subject matter, as has been said, of the legislation is extremely peculiar.
It concerns the rights and privileges of the electors and of the Legislative Assem bly to which they elect members.
Those rights and privi leges have always in every colony, following the example of the mother country, been jealously maintained and guarded by the Leg","Article 329 (b) of the Constitution of India provides that ""no election to either House of Parliament or to the House or either House of the Legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for, by or under any law made by the appropriate Legislature.
"" The Representation of the People Act, 1951, which made detailed provisions for election to the various Legislatures of the country also contains a provision (sec. 80) that no election shall be called in question except by an election petition presented in accordance with the provisions of the Act.
The appellant, who was a candidate for election to the Legislative Assembly of the State of Madras and whose nomi nation paper was rejected by the Returning Officer, applied to the High Court of Madras under article 226 of the Consti tution for a writ of certiorari to quash the order of the Returning Officer rejecting his nomination paper and to direct the Returning Officer to include his name in the list of valid nominations to be published: Held by the Full Court (PATANJALI SASTRI, C.J., FAZL ALl, MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA, DAS and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR JJ.) that in view of the provisions of article 329 (b) of the Constitution and sec.
80 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the High Court had no jurisdiction to interfere with the order of the Returning Officer.
The word ""election"" has by long usage in connection with the process of selection of proper representatives in demo cratic institutions acquired both a wide and a narrow mean ing.
In the 219 narrow sense it is used to mean the final selection of a candidate which may embrace the result of the poll when there is polling, or a particular candidate being returned unopposed when there is no poll.
In the wide sense, the word is used to connote the entire process culminating in a candidate being declared elected and it is in this wide sense that the word is used in Part XV of the Constitution in which article 329 (b) occurs.
The scheme of Part XV of the Constitution and the Repre sentation of the People Act, 1951, seems to be that any matter which has the effect of vitiating an election should be brought up only at the appropriate stage in an appropri ate manner before a special tribunal and should not be brought up at an intermediate stage before any court.
Under the election law, the only significance which the rejection of a nomination paper has, consists in the fact that it can be used as a ground to call the election in question.
Article 329 (b) was apparently enacted to prescribe the manner in which and the stage at which this ground, and other grounds which may be raised under the law to call the election in question, could be urged.
It follows by neces sary implication from the language of this provision that those grounds cannot be urged in any other manner, at any other stage and before any other court.
If the grounds on which an election can be called in question could be raised at an earlier stage and errors, if any, are rectified, there will be no meaning in enacting a provision like article 329(b) and in setting up a special tribunal.
Any other meaning ascribed to the words used in the article would lead to anomalies, which the Constitution could not have contem plated, one of them being that conflicting views may be expressed by the High Court at the pre polling stage and by the election tribunal which is to be an independent body, at the stage when the matter is brought up before it.
There fore, questioning the rejection of a nomination paper is ""questioning the election"" within the meaning of article ,329 (b) of the Constitution and sec.
80 of the Representa tion of the People Act, 1951.
Having regard to the important functions which the legislatures have to perform in democratic countries, it has always been recognized to be a matter of first importance that elections should be concluded as early as possible according to time schedule and all controversial matters and all disputes arising out of elections should be postponed till after the elections are over, so that the election proceedings may not be unduly retarded or protracted.
In conformity with this principle, the scheme of the election law in this country as well as in England is that no signif icance should be attached to anything which does not affect the ""election""; and if any irregularities are committed while, it is in progress and they belong to the category or class which.
under the law by which elections are governed, would have the effect of vitiating the ""election"" and enable the person affected to 220 call it in question, they should be brought up before a special tribunal by means of an election petition and not be made the subject of a dispute before any court while the election is in progress.
The right to vote or stand as a candidate for election is not a civil right but is a creature of statute or special law and must be subject to the limitations imposed by it.
Strictly speaking, it is the sole right of the Legislature to examine and determine all matters relating to the elec tion of its own members, and if the legislature takes it out of its own hands and vests in a special tribunal an entirely new and unknown jurisdiction, that special jurisdiction should be exercised in accordance with the law which creates it.
Where a right or liability is created by a statute which gives a special remedy for enforcing it, the remedy provided by that statute only must be availed of.

Appeal from the Judgment and Order of the High Court of Calcutta (HARRIES C.J. and LAHIRI J.) dated 15th June, 1950, in Criminal Appeal No. 71 of 1950 and Revision No. 295 of 1950.
S.N. Mukherjee, for the appellant.
B. Sen, for the respondent.
December 14.
The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J.
This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court at Calcutta upholding the order of the Ses sions Judge of Midnapore convicting the appellant under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code and sentencing him to 3 years ' rigorous imprisonment.
The prosecution case against the appellant may be short ly stated as follows: The appellant and the injured person, Kurnad Patra, are first cousins, and they live in a village called Andaria, their houses being only 3 or 4 cubits apart from each other.
They had a dispute about a pathway adjoin ing their houses, which led to a tank, and they quarrelled about it on the 11th July, 1949.
Two days later, on the lath July, when Kumad Patra was washing his hands at the brink of the village tank, the appellant came from behind and inflicted on him 17 injuries.
with the result that two of his fingers had to be amputated and a piece of bone had to be extracted from his left thumb.
The police being informed, started investigation and submitted a charge sheet against the appellant who was finally committed to the Court of Sessions and tried by the Sessions Judge and a jury.
He was charged under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code, but the jury returned a verdict of guilty against him under section 326 of the Penal Code, and the learned Sessions Judge accepting the verdict convicted him under that section as aforesaid.
When the matter came up in appeal to the High Court, a rule was issued on the appellant calling upon him to show cause why his sentence 204 should not be enhanced, but, at the final hearing, the rule was discharged, his appeal was dismissed, and his conviction and the original sentence were upheld.
The first point urged on behalf of the appellant before us is that, inasmuch as there was no charge under section 326 of the Penal Code and the offence under that section was not a minor offence with reference to an offence under section 307 of the Code, he could not have been convicted under the former section.
This argument however overlooks the provisions of section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
That section, after referring to section 236 which provides that alternative charges may be drawn up against an accused person where it is doubtful which of several of fences the facts which can be proved will constitute, states as follows : ""If . . the accused is charged with one offence, and it appears in evidence that he committed a different offence for which he might have been charged under the provisions of that section, he may be convicted of the offence which he is shown to have committed, although he was not charged with it.
"" There can be no doubt that on the facts of this case, it was open to the Sessions Judge to charge the appellant alternatively under sections 307 and 326 of the Penal Code.
The case therefore clearly falls under section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code and the appellant 's conviction under section 326 of the Penal Code was proper even in the absence of a charge.
In Begu vs The King Emperor (1) the Privy Council had to deal with a case where certain persons were charged under section 302 of the Penal Code, but were convicted under section 201 for causing the disappearance of evidence.
Their Lordships upheld the conviction, and while referring to section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code, they ob served: ""A man may be convicted of an offence, although there has been no charge in respect of it, if the evidence is such as to establish a charge that might have (1) (1925) 52 I.A. 191, 205 been made .
Their Lordships entertain no doubt that the procedure was a proper procedure and one warranted by the Code of Criminal Procedure.
"" The second point urged on behalf of the appellant is that the High Court having issued a rule for the enhancement of the sentence, he should have been allowed to argue the merits of the case which he was not allowed to do.
The learned counsel for the appellant was not, however, able to show that even if it was open to him to argue on the merits of the case the decision would have been otherwise.
Only three contentions were put forward by him, these being : (1) that several material witnesses were not examined; (2.) that the appellant 's case was not placed before the jury in a fair manner; and (3) that there was no proper examination of the appel lant under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
We have examined these contentions and find that they are entirely without merit.
In urging his first contention, the learned counsel stated that though it was admitted that several persons have got houses to the east, north and north west of the tank where the occurrence is alleged to have taken place, they have not been examined by the prose cution.
He further argued that one Sarat Chandra Ghose, who was present at the house of the accused when it was searched, has also not been examined.
These arguments however have very little force, since there is no evidence to show that those persons had seen the occurrence, an d they also do not take note of the fact that such evidence as has been adduced by the prosecution, if believed, was suffi cient to support the conviction of the appellant.
The Ses sions Judge in his charge to the jury referred specifically to the very argument urged before us, and he told 'the jurors that if they thought it fit it was open to them to draw an inference against the prosecution.
There can be no doubt that the jurors were 27 206 properly directed on the point and they evidently thought that the evidence before them was sufficient for convicting the appellant.
The second contention urged on behalf of the appellant relates to his defence, which, briefly stated, was that Kumad Patra, the injured man, entered his house during his temporary absence, went to the bedroom of his wife, who was a young lady, and committed indecent assault on her and was assaulted in these circumstances.
This story was not sup ported by any evidence but was merely suggested in cross examination, and the Sessions Judge while referring to it in his charge to the jury, observed: ' 'If I were left alone, I would not have believed the defence version.
But you are not bound to accept my opin ion, nor you should be influenced by it It is for you to decide whether you will accept the defence suggestion in favour of which there is no such positive evidence.
"" The Sessions Judge undoubtedly expressed himself some what strongly with regard to the defence suggestion, but he coupled his observations, which we think he was entitled to make, with an adequate warning to the jurors that they were not bound to accept his opinion and should not be influenced by it.
The defence version was rejected by the jury, and there can be no doubt that on the materials on the record it would have been rejected by any court of fact.
The last contention put forward by the learned counsel for the appellant was that he was not examined as required by law under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
It appears that three questions ware put to the appellant by the Sessions Judge after the conclusion of the prosecution evidence.
In the first question, the Sessions Judge asked the appellant what his defence was as to the evidence ad duced, against him; in the second question, the Judge re ferred to the dispute about the pathway and asked the appel lant whether he had inflicted injuries on Kumad Patra; and in the third question, the appellant was asked.
207 whether he would adduce any evidence.
The facts of the case being free from any complications and the points in issue being simple, we find it difficult to hold that the examina tion of the appellant in this particular case was not ade quate.
To sustain such an argument as has been put forward, it is not sufficient for the accused merely to show that he has not been fully examined as required by section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, but he must also show that such examination has materially prejudiced him.
In the present case, it appears that the point urged here was not raised in the grounds of appeal to the High Court, nor does it find a place in the grounds of appeal or in the statement of case filed in this court.
It has nowhere been stated that the accused was in any way prejudiced, and there are no materi als before us to hold that he was or might have been preju diced.
We have read the Sessions Judge 's charge to the jury, which is a very fair and full charge, and nothing has been shown to us to justify the conclusion that the verdict of the jury should not have been accepted.
The appeal accordingly fails and is dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
","The appellant who inflicted serious injuries on another was charged under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code but the jury returned a verdict of guilty against him under section 326 of the Penal Code, and the Sessions Judge, accepting the verdict, convicted him under section 326.
It was contended that the conviction was illegal inasmuch as the offence under section 326 was not a minor offence with reference to the offence under section 307.
Held, that as it was open to the Sessions Judge, on the facts of the case, to charge the appellant alternatively under sections 307 and 326 of the Code the case was covered by section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and the conviction under section 328 of the Penal Code was proper, even though there was no charge under the section.
Begu vs King Emperor (52 I.A. 191) applied.
In order that a conviction may be set aside for non compliance with the provisions of section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, it is not sufficient for the accused merely to show that he was not fully examined as required by the section, but he must also show that such examination has materially prejudiced him.

T.L. Shivde, Advocate General of Madhya Pradesh (T. P. Naik, with him) for the respondent.
Sept. 23.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.
This is a consolidated appeal by special leave from the two orders of the High Court of Judicature at Nagpur passed on the 9th March, 1950, in Criminal Revisions Nos. 152 and 153 of 1949.
On a complaint filed by the Assistant Inspector General of Police, Anti Corruption Department, Nagpur, the appel lant in Criminal Appeal No. 56 of 1951 (H. G. Nargundkar, Excise Commissioner, Madhya Pradesh), and the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 57 of 1951 (R.S. Patel) were tried in the court of Shri B.K. Chaudhri, Special Magistrate, Nag pur, for the offence of conspiracy to secure the contract of Seoni Distillery from April, 1947, to March 1951 by forging the tender, Exhibit P 3A, and for commission of the offences of forgery of the tender (Exhibit P 3A) and of another document, Exhibit P 24.
The learned Special Magistrate convicted both the appellants on all the three charges.
He sentenced R.S. Patel to rigorous imprisonment for one year under each charge and to pay fines of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 2,000, and Rs. 1,000, under the first, second and third charges respectively.
The appellant Nargundkar was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for six months under each charge and to pay fines of Rs. 2,000, Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 1.,000, under the first, second and third charges respectively.
Each of the appellants appealed against their respective convictions and sentences to the Court of the Sessions Judge, Nagpur.
The learned Sessions Judge quashed the conviction of both the appellants under the first charge of criminal conspiracy under section 120 B, I.P.C., but maintained the 1093 convictions and sentences under section 465, I.P.C. or the charges of forging Exhibits P 3 (A) and P 24.
Both the appellants went up in revision against this decision to the High Court but without any success.
An application was then made under article 136 of the Constitution of India for special leave to appeal and this was allowed by this Court on 24th March, 1950 The appellant, Nargundkar, is a member of the Central Provinces & Berar Provincial Service and held the substan tive post of Deputy Commissioner for several years.
In April, 1946, he was appointed Excise Commissioner.
Madhya Pradesh, and continued to hold that office till the 5th September, '1947.
The appellant, R.S. Patel, is a sugar Technologist and Chemical Engineer.
He received his technical education and practical training in America and after working as Chief Chemist and General Manager in factories in Madras for five years, came to the Central Provinces in 1944, when the Provincial Government gave him a licence to set up a dis tillery for the manufacture of industrial spirit.
On the 11th September, 1946, Nargundkar in his capacity as Excise Commissioner invited tenders for working the Government distillery at Seoni and supplying spirit to certain specified districts f or a period of four years from 1st April, 1947, to 31st March, 1951.
The last date for submitting the tenders was the 31st October, 1946.
In response to this tender notice, five tenders were filed including those filed by (1) appellant, R.S. Patel, (2) K.B. Habibur Rahman, (3).
Zakirur Rahman, and (4) Edulji V. Doongaji (P. W. 4), in sealed covers with the Excise Commis sioner on the 31st October, 1946, and he handed them over with the seals intact to the office superintende.
nt, S.W. Gadgil (P. w. 13), for safe custody.
Gadgil took them to his room and kept them under lock and key in the office safe.
The case for the prosecution is that on the 9th Novem ber, 1946, accused Nargundkar took these sealed tenders home, that the tenders were opened by him at his house, that the rates of the tender (Exhibit 1094 P 6) of E.J. Doongaji (P. W. 4) were divulged to accused 2 (R. section Patel), who was allowed to substitute another tender (Exhibit P 3A), containing rates lower than those of Doongaji, that thereafter these open tenders were brought to the office on the 11th November, 1946, and given to Amarnath (P.W. 20) who was the Assistant Commissioner of Excise, for submitting a report and that on the recommendation of Nar gundkar the tender of accused 2 (Patel) was accepted and the contract was given to him.
In May, 1947, on receipt of an application (Exhibit P 1) from one Dilbagrai (P. W. 14), enquiries were started by the Anti Corruption Department.
Both the accused became aware of the enquiry.
In order to create evidence in their favour they brought into existence a letter (Exhibit P 24) and antedated it to 20th November, 1946.
This document was forged with the intention of com mitting fraud and of causing injury to Amarnath (P. W. 20) and also to Doongaji (P.W. 4).
Exhibit P 24 is alleged to have been typed on a typewriter (Article A) which was pur chased on the 30th December, 1946, by the National Industri al Alcohol Co., Nagpur, of which accused Patel was the managing director.
It Was further alleged that the endorse ment made by accused 1 (Nargundkar) in the said letter ""No action seems necessary.
File"", and marked to Superintendent ""S"" was not made on the 21st November, 1946, which date it bears.
This letter was handed over by accused 1 to the Office Superintendent, S.W. Gadgil (P.W. 13) about the middle of August, 1947, and thereafter accused I wrote a letter (Exhibit P. 26), on the 2nd October, 1947, to Sri section Sanyal (P.W. 19) who was then the Excise Commissioner, requesting that this letter (Exhibit P 24) and a note sheet (Exhibit P 27) be kept in sale custody.
Both the accused denied the commission of the offences of criminal conspiracy, forgery and abetment thereof.
Nargundkar denied having attended office on the 9th Novem ber, 1946.
He denied having taken the tenders home.
Ac cording to him, the tenders were opened by him in the office on the 1095 11th November, 1946.
Accused 2 denied that the tender of Doongaji was shown to him by accused 1 between the 9th and 11th November, 1946.
He stated that the tender (Exhibit P 3A) was the original tender submitted by him on the 31st October, 1946.
As regards Exhibit P 24, it was denied that it was fabricated or antedated.
Accused 2 stated that it was not typed on article A.
He also alleged that the allegations made in Exhibit P 24 were correct.
Accused Nargundkar stated that the endorsement was made by him on the 21st November, 1946.
The first charge having failed, nothing need be said about it herein.
In order to prove the second charge the prosecution had to establish that Gadgil, P.W. 13, handed over the sealed tenders on the 9th November, 1946, to accused Nargundkar, that the latter took them home, that between the 9th and the 11th November he met Patel at his house or elsewhere and that accused.
Nargundkar showed or communicated the particu lars of the tender of Doongaji to accused Patel who substi tuted Exhibit P 3A for his original tender before the 11th November, 1946.
Admittedly there is no direct evidence to prove any of these facts except the first one, and the nature of the case is such that recourse could only be had to circumstantial evidence to establish those facts.
The fact that the sealed tenders were handed over by Gadgil to accused Nargundkar on the 9th November has been held proved solely on the uncorroborated testimony of Gadgil as against the denial of Nargundkar.
Gadgil was himself a suspect in the case.
He was kept by the police away from the office for about eight months during the investigation, he was asked to proceed on leave at the instance of the police and his leave was extended at their request.
On the expiry of his leave he was kept off duty without salary for a period of about five months but later on he was paid his full salary after he had given evidence in support of the prosecution.
He made addi tions and improvements on vital points from stage to stage of his deposition and in certain particulars his statement was contradicted by Ramaswami, P.W. 80.
On his own admission he is an accomplice in respect 1096 of the forgery of Exhibit P 27, one of the documents al leged to have been forged for purposes of the defence but concerning which no prosecution was started.
Exhibit P 27 bears date 31st October, 1946.
Gadgil 's statement about it is as follows: ""He (Nargundkar) put down his signature and the date 31st October, 1946.
This order was actually written by Sh.
Nargundkar in the note sheet, Exhibit P 27, in the month of July or August, 1947.
The dates were antedated.
In the margin of the note sheet I have put down my initials S.W.G. and put the date 31st October, 1946.
This note sheet was not prepared on gist October, 1946.
He asked me to keep it in my custody.
"" The witness admittedly became a party to the preparation of a forged document.
Whether he was telling the truth, or he was telling a lie, as appears likely from his cross examination, he is in either event, not a person on whom any reliance could be placed.
It is curious that this aspect of the evidence of Gadgil has not been noticed by any of the three courts below.
When the court of first instance and the court of appeal arrive at concurrent findings of fact after believing the evidence of a witness, this court as the final court does not disturb such findings, save in most exceptional cases.
But where a finding of fact is arrived at on the testimony of a witness of the character of Gadgil and the courts below depart from the rule of prudence that such testimony should not be accepted unless it is corroborated by some other evidence on the record, a finding of that character in the circumstances of a particular case may well be reviewed even on special leave if the other circumstances in the ease require it, and substantial and grave injustice has result ed.
After fully examining the material on the record we have reached the conclusion that the courts below were in error in accepting the uncorroborated testimony of Gadgil to find the fact that he handed over the tenders to Nargund kar on the 9th November, 1946.
The witness was not allowed to live in a free atmosphere and was kept under police 1097 surveillance during the whole of the period of investigation and the trial and was rewarded with payment of his full salary after he had given evidence to the satisfaction of the prosecution.
He is a person who felt no hesitation in deposing on oath that he willingly became a party to the forgery of Exhibit 13 27.
Assuming that the accused Nargundkar had taken the tenders to his house, the prosecution, in order to bring the guilt home to the accused, has yet to prove the other facts referred to above.
No direct ' evidence was adduced in proof of those facts.
Reliance was placed by the prosecution and by the courts below on certain circumstances, and intrinsic evidence contained in the impugned document, Exhibit P 3A.
In dealing with circumstantial evidence the rules specially applicable to such evidence must be borne in mind.
In such cases there is always the danger that conjecture or suspi cion may take the place of legal proof and therefore it is right to recall the warning addressed by Baron Alderson to the jury in Reg vs Hodge (1) where he said : ""The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circum stances to one another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to force them to form parts of one connected whole; and the more ingenious the mind of the individual, the more likely was it, considering such matters, to over reach and mislead itself, to supply some little link that 'is wanting, to take for granted some fact consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render them complete.
"" It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature,the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established, and all the facts so estab lished should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.
Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.
In (1) 141 1098 other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far com plete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.
In spite of the force ful arguments addressed to us by the learned Advocate Gener al on behalf of the State we have not been able to discover any such evidence either intrinsic within Exhibit P 3A or ,outside and we are constrained to observe that the courts below have just fallen into the error against which warning was uttered by Baron Alderson in the above mentioned case.
The trial magistrate was of the opinion that friendship between the two accused was of a very rapid growth and that their relations were very intimate and accused 2 was in a position to influence accused 1.
He thus found that there was motive for the commission of the crime.
The learned Sessions Judge disagreed with this finding and the High Court agreed with the Sessions Judge on this point.
It observed that the evidence which tended to prove friendship or undue favour was not such as to form the basis for a finding.
It further found that there was nothing to show that the appellant Nargundkar received any illegal reward or the promise of one for showing Doongaji 's tender to accused R.S. Patel.
The first circumstance therefore on which the trial Judge placed considerable reliance was negatived by the court of appeal and in revision.
It having been found that there was no motive whatsoever for accused Nargundkar to show the tenders to accused Patel and to take a substi tuted tender from him, the main link in the chain of reason ing of the trial court vanishes.
Amiable relations between the two accused or their official relationship could not be regarded as sufficient motive for committing the crime of forgery.
The mainstay of the prosecution case is the intrinsic evidence of the contents of Exhibit P 3A itself which ac cording to the courts below are unusual, peculiar and strange and which according to the Advocate General could not be there if it was a genune 1099 document.
The argument would have force provided the prem ises on which it is based are correct.
Having examined the contents of Exhibit P 3A, we do not find anything very unusual or extraordinary in it which could not be there without its author having seen Exhibit P 6.
We now proceed to examine the so called peculiar features in Exhibit P 3A.
In order to appreciate the points made by the learned Advocate General it is necessary to set out certain facts.
Exhibit P 9 is the notice calling for tenders for the supply of country spirit in the Seoni distillery area.
The rates which were called for by this notice were as follows: 1.
Flat rate for four years.
Rates on sliding scale for four years.
All in rate on the sliding scale for one year 1947 48. 4.
Flat rates on the basis of the price of mahua flowers for three years 1948 51. 5.
All in sliding scale rate on the basis of the price of mahua flowers for three years 1948 51.
The trial magistrate held on a construction of it that no rate or rates of separate years were asked for in this notice and that one flat rate was only asked for, for four years.
Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman in their tenders, Exhibits P 4 and P 5, quoted one flat rate for four years and did not mention separate flat rates for separate years.
Doongaji in his tender, Exhibit P 6, mentioned separate flat rates for each separate year also.
He did so because he consulted one Mr. Munshi, Personal Assistant to the Excise Commissioner, whether he should quote each rate separately and Mr. Munshi told him that he could give flat rate for the combined years as well as flat rates and also sliding scale rates for each year separately.
Admittedly accused 2 was working as an agent of Habibur Rahman and his son Zakirur Rahman for the distillery contracts of Betul and Seoni, and, therefore, he must have been the author not only of his own tender but of the tenders submitted by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman, Exhibits 1100 P 4 and P 5.
All of them were acting together with the object of getting the contract though they were submitting three separate tenders.
The trial magistrate held that as Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman gave one flat rate for four years as called for by Exhibit P 9, but accused 2, the author of all these tenders, did not do it in Exhibit P 3A, but followed the method of Doongaji in giving the rates of each year separately as well as the rate for the combined four years.
lie must have done so as he was shown the tender Exhibit P section The question arises whether the circumstance that the accused Patel and Habibur Rahrnan and Zakirur Rahman were acting together was such from which a necessary inference arises that the accused Patel must have been the author of all the three tenders and, if he were, that he could not have departed from the method adopted by him in preparing Exhibits P 4 and P 5 unless and until he had seen Exhibit P 6.
We are clearly of the opinion that from the premises stated this inference does not necessarily follow.
Doongaji even after reading Exhibit P 9, could not make up his mind whether to submit the tender with one flat rate for all the four years or whether to submit it by giving sepa rate flat rates for each of the four years and made enquiry from the office of the Excise Commissioner and then quoted separate rates for each of the four years separately also.
Patel who has admittedly considerable experience of distill ery contracts and about the method of submitting tenders might very well have thought that it was best to quote a flat rate for all the years as well as a flat rate for each year separately.
The circumstance that he did not do so in the other two tenders prepared by him does not materially advance the prosecution case.
The very object of submitting several tenders on behalf of three persons acting in unison was to indicate to the excise authorities that they were being submitted by three different persons.
If there were no variations whatsoever between those tenders that would have defeated the very purpose of submitting them.
More over, a variation of this trifling nature between Exhibits P 3A and P 4 1101 and P 5 cannot be said to be of such an unusual or of such an extraordinary character as to warrant the inference that it could not have been made except without a look at the tender of Doongaji.
The circumstance is of a neutral charac ter and the trial magistrate and the learned Sessions Judge gave undue importance to it, being obsessed with the idea that such a quotation of flat rates for each year could not be mentioned in a tender by a contractor merely on a con struction of Exhibit P 9 and without any further inquiry or without seeing the tender of somebody else who had followed that method.
The next circumstance on which considerable reliance is placed is that accused 2 studiously maintained rates below the rates of Doongaji throughout, that when Doongaji lowered his rates for the second year accused 2 did the same, and when Doongaji raised his rates for the third and fourth years accused 2 also did so, at the same time maintaining rates lower than Doongaji 's rates.
It is said that the system followed by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman and Patel originally must have been the same as Patel was the author of all the three tenders, that Habibur Rahman 'srates were higher than Zakirur Rahman 's by six pies and this variation was constant throughout, that in Patel 's original tender which must have followed the same system his rates would be lower than Habibur Rahman 's by three pies through out.
Exhibit P 3A, however, shows that this is not so.
Patel abandoned the system when he found that his rates on his original scheme would be higher than the correspond ing rates of Doongaji.
Learned Advocate General contended that it was impossible for Patel unless he had seen Exhibit P 6, to quote rates of a large number of items numbering about 197, in every case lower than the rates given in Exhibit P 6 and the circumstance that in not a single case he has quoted a higher rate than Exhibit P 6 is conclusive of the fact that he had done so after he had seen Exhibit P 6.
It was also said that there is no satisfactory explana tion why Patel abandoned the scheme adopted by him in 1102 drawing up Exhibits P 4 and P 5 and his original tender.
In our view, this circumstance again is not so strange or peculiar as was made out by the learned Advocate General or in the courts below.
In the first place, there is no material whatsoever for the assumption that the so called original tender was drawn up on the same scheme as Exhibits P 4 and P 5 or that there was a constant variation in rates between it and Habibur Rahman 's tender.
It has been assumed on mere surmise that the first five rates in the tender, Exhibit P 3A, are the rates that had been originally quoted.
The original tender is not forthcoming and there is no evidence at all about its contents.
Moreover, in the depo sition of Doongaji it was elicited that in the year 1942 when tenders for the Seoni distillery contract were called for, the rates quoted by Ratanshah were lower than his rates for all items.
He, however, voluntarily added that Ratanshah obtained his rates of the previous contracts before he submitted his tender for the year 1942 and that he had made a reduction of annas two to three in those rates but he was forced to admit that the rate of Ratanshah in the tender was not only lower than his but was also lower throughout than the rates of Laxminarain, Haji Ismail and Habibur Rahman even without seeing their tenders.
From this statement it is quite clear that even without seeing the tenders of differ ent tenderers a contractor may quote rock bottom rates of all items on his own calculation or impelled by the desire of taking the contract anyhow.
We do not follow why Patel could not do in 1946 what was done by Ratanshah in his tenders in 1942 and quote rates lower in all particulars and regarding all items than the rates of Doongaji.
If a person is out to give rockbottom rates and his calculation is such that his rates work out lower than the rates of others, it may well be that he may quote lower rates in respect of all items.
It was then said that Patel had adopted a particular plan in submitting the three tenders, of himself, Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman and that his plan was that his rates should be less by three pies 1103 than the rates he had quoted for Habibur Rahman, that in the first five items of Exhibit 145 he stuck to that plan and did not alter the rates of those items as originally submit ted by him, as those rates were lower than the rates of Doongaji but from the sixth item onwards he substituted new rates for the ones he had originally submitted and he de parted from the plan so that his rates for each item were to be lower only by three pies as compared with the rates of Habibur Rahman.
It is no doubt true that Patel did not adhere to the plan that he adopted in the first five items of his tender but is that a circumstance from which any inference can be drawn that the first five items are a part of his original tender or that he did so depart from them because he had seen Exhibit P 6 and he wanted to underbid Doongaji.
As we have already said, the object of submitting three separate tenders ostensibly by persons who were acting together was to secure the contract in one or the other name and Patel who was the author of all the three documents may very well in his own document have quoted much lower figures than were quoted by Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman, in order also to give the impression that all these tenders had not been submitted by one and the same person.
Be that as it may, a closer examination of the tenders of Doongaji and Patel completely negatives the theory of the courts below.
The rates quoted in the first five items of Exhibit P 145 are lower than the rates of Doongaji by 102, 69, 18, 12 and 9 pies respectively.
Even in the subsequent quotations except in one case where the disparity in the tales of Doongaji and Patel is only two pies, the disparity in the rates is from 9 to 11 pies.
Patel is certainly a businessman and the whole object of quoting the rates was to earn the maximum profit.
If he had seen the tender of Doongaji he would have modelled the rates in a manner that would give him the highest profit.
The learned Advocate General could not suggest any reason whatsoever why Patel would maintain his quotation for the quantity of 50,000 gallons at Rs, 2 10 6 when the rate of Doongaji was Rs. 3 3 0 1104 He could easily raise the quotation to Rs. 3 and similarly in all other cases he could have underbid Doongaji by 2, 3 or 6 pies at the most.
He need not have maintained a dis parity of 9 to 11 pies between his rates and the rates of Doongaji.
In our opinion, therefore, no conclusion of any character could be drawn from the disparity in the rates of Doongaji or of Patel or of the expected uniformity in the rates of Habibur Rahman or of R.S. Patel which would estab lish that Exhibit P 3A had been prepared by having a look at Exhibit P 6.
Another circumstance on which reliance was placed was that certain rates in Exhibit P 3A are lower than the corre sponding rates in Exhibit P 6 by only one or two pies.
There is no doubt that one or two rates are lower by two pies than the rates in Exhibit P 6 but nothing follows from that innocent circumstance, unless one starts with a pre sumption of guilt.
Once it is assumed that the tender of Doongaji was shown to Patel, all these circumstances might to some extent fit in with the view that in certain respects it may have been copied from Exhibit P 6.
The courts below fell into this error and departed from the rule that in a criminal case an accused person is to be presumed to be innocent and that it is for the prosecution to establish his guilt conclusively.
Next it was urged that in the covering letter Exhibit P 3 sent by Patel he mentions three appendices numbered 1, 2 and 3, The same expression finds place in the covering letter Exhibit P 4 of Habibur Rahman and Exhibit P~5 of Zakirur Rahman, that appendices 1 to a of the tender of Habibur Rahman and Zakirur Rahman correctly answer to the reference in the covering letters but this is not so in Patel 's case; on the other hand, instead of appendix 1, Patel has appendix 1 (a) and 1 (b) and the number of his appendices thus goes up to four and this departure from Exhibits P 4 and P 5 came about because of his having seen Exhibit P 6 and the number of appendices annexed to it.
It was urged that the original tender of Patel must have contained three appendices like those of Habibur Rahman and 1105 Zakirur Rahman and not appendix l(a) and l(b) as now found and that this circumstance showed substitution of the 'tender.
The learned magistrate, in our opinion, in giving importance to this circumstance mislead himself completely.
In the first place, it is not accurate to say that the expression appendices 1, 2 and 3 was common to the covering letters Exhibts P 4 and P 5.
In Exhibit P 5 the appen dices are marked A, B and C. Therefore, no uniform method was adopted by Patel in marking the appendices to the ten ders, Exhibits P 4 and P 5.
Secondly, there is no conflict in the expression of the appendices of Habibur Rahman and Patel.
They have been marked as 1, 2 and 3 and a mere subdi vision of the first appendix into (a) and (b) could not be taken to be a departure from the method adopted in the description of the appendices.
It may further be observed that the covering letter signed by Patel mentions four appendices, while the covering letters of Habibur and Zaki rur Rahman only mention three appendices.
The trial magis trate as well as the Sessions Judge ignored all these dif ferences in the method of the description of the appendices and assumed that they had been uniformly described.
The result therefore is that all these so called peculiar features found by the courts below in Exhibit P 3A should be eliminated from consideration and it must be held that there are really no circumstances inconsistent with Exhibit P 3A being a genuine document.
It could have been made out without looking at Exhibit P 6.
In this view of the case the whole basis on which the judgments of the courts below are founded vanishes, and in the absence of any evidence of motive, we are of the opinion that the facts did not on any just or legal view of them warrant a conviction, and al though the proceedings are taken to have been unobjection able in form, justice has gravely and injuriously miscar ried.
We therefore set aside the conviction of both the appellants on the second charge and acquit them, 142 1106 In order to appreciate the third charge, it is necessary to set out the terms of Exhibit P 24 which it is said was antedated in order to create evidence for the defence of the accused and to injure Amarnath.
It is in these terms: Congress Nagar, Nagpur, 20th November, 1946.
The Commissioner of Excise, C.P. & Berar, Nagpur.
Dear Sir, I beg to submit few of my complaints for such action as you may be pleased to take, which are as under.
I went to see Mr. Amarnath last week, at his residence in connection with Seoni Distillery work.
I saw Mr. Edulji and his partner with Mr. Amarnath in the office room of his residence with some office files.
From the papers I could recognize my tender open on the table in front of them.
As soon as I went there, all of them were astonished and they could not speak with me for a moment, and then they carried on some dry general conversation with me.
Same way after about a week, when I went to Seoni for mahua bill, when Mr. Amarnath visited for sanctioning the advance, I had the opportunity to see Mr. Amarnath in dak bungalow at about 9 30 p.m. when I saw Mr. Mehta the ex manager of Mr. Edulji (who is also the manager of Seoni Electric Co.) with Mr. Amarnath near table with the same file of the tender.
No doubt after seeing the above two incidents I requested Mr. Amarnath to be fair in this af fair.
I am bringing these incidents to your notice, as I fear that something underhand may not be going on, and I am afraid that my tender may be tampered with.
Hoping to get justice, Yours faithfully, Sd.
R.S. Patel.
"" 1107 The words ""Congress Nagar, Nagpur, 20th November, 1946"" are in manuscript, while the rest of the letter has been typed.
The digit 6 of the year 1946 has been over written on digit 7 written in continental style and it is apparent to the naked eye that originally the writer wrote 7 and subsequently changed it to 6.
It was contended by the learned Advocate General, and this is the finding of the courts below, that this letter was written some time during the investigation of the case in July or August 1947, and was antedated in order to implicate Amarnath and to use it as evidence in defence.
The point for decision is wheth er there is any evidence whatsoever to establish this act.
We have not been able to discover any such evidence on the record; on the other hand the intrinsic evidence in the letter proves that most likely it came into existence on the date it bears.
The relevant facts are that the tenders were opened by accused Nargundkar on the 11th November, 1946, he handed them over after making the endorsements to Amarnath and Amarnath had to submit a report about them.
It is alleged in this letter that ""last week"", i.e., during the week commencing on the 11th November, 1946, accused Patel went to see Amarnath and ","In dealing with circumstantial evidence there is always the danger that conjecture or suspicion may take the place of legal proof.
It is therefore right to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused.
Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency, and they should be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved.
In other words, there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused.

63.txt,"Civil Appeal No. 90 of 1950.
Appeal against the Judgment and Decree dated the 22nd July 1948 of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta (K. C. Mitter, and K.C. Chunder J J) in appeal from Original Decree No. 49 of 1942 arising 74 574 out of Decree dated the 8th September 1941 of the Subordi nate Judge at Asansole in Suit No. 1 of 1941.
Purusottam Chatterji (section N. Mukherjee, with him) for the appellants.
Panchanan Ghose, (P. C. Chatterjee, with him) for the respondent.
May 4. 'the following judgments were delivered : DAS J.
This appeal arises out of a suit filed by the appellants on January 2, 1941, in the Court of the Subordi nate Judge, Asansole.
That suit came to be filed in circum stances which may now be stated shortly.
A suit had been instituted by one Kumar Dakhineswar Malia against Rameswar Malia, Rani Bhaba Sundari and others for partition of the Searsole Raj Estate.
One Bhagabati Charan Mitra was appointed receiver of that estate in that suit.
On August 10, 1908, the said receiver with the permis sion of the Court which had appointed him as receiver grant ed two mining leases, each for 999 years one in respect of 5/16 share of the Malias in Mouza Monohar Bahal and the other in respect of 230 bighas in village Marich Kota to a firm then carrying on business under the name and style of Laik Banerjee & Company.
On the same day the said receiver with like permission mortgaged these properties to the said firm as security for the due repayment of the loan of Rs. 100,000 advanced by that firm.
The Malias joined the re ceiver in executing the aforesaid leases and the mortgage.
As a result of these transactions the firm of Laik Banerjee & Company became the lessees for 999 years of the two properties as well as the mortgagee of the lessors ' interest in the same.
By diverse processes not necessary to be detailed, the appellants have become the successors in interest of the mortgagors and the respondent Deva Prasanna Mukerjee has become the successor in interest of the mortga gee under the mortgage of August 10, 1908.
575 On March 31, 1922, Deva Prasanna filed suit No. 78 of 1922 for enforcing the mortgage of 1908.
Preliminary decree was passed in the last mentioned suit on ' July 31, 1928, and a final decree for sale was made I on February 26, 1929.
In execution of this final decree the mortgaged properties were sold at a Court i sale and were purchased by Deva Prasanna for ' Rs. 59,000.
This sale was confirmed by the Court on June 30, 1931.
A large sum remaining still due to Deva Prasanna, he applied for, and on October 30, 1935, obtained a personal decree for Rs. 1,27,179 0 6 against Raja Pramatha Nath Malia who had by inheritance acquired the lessors ' interest and become the borrower.
In 1936, Deva Prasanna started execution case No. 118 of 1936 for execution of the personal decree and attached certain properties alleging that the same belonged to the Raja.
The exact date of the attachment does not appear from the printed record.
The Raja as Sibait of a certain deity and his two sons, the appellants before us, objected to the attachment of these properties and filed a claim case.
Negotiations for settlement started and eventually, on January 30, 1937, a petition (exhibit 2) was filed in the exe cuting Court stating as follows : ""The judgment debtor having made special requests to the decree holder for an amicable settlement of the aforesaid execution case, the decree holder has agreed to the same.
But some time is required to settle the talks and all the terms etc.
The judgment debtor has paid to the decree holder the costs of this execution amounting to Rs. 76 14 0, and he having made requests for this execution case being struck off for the present on keeping the attachment in force, the decreeholder has agreed to it.
It is, therefore, prayed that under the circumstances aforesaid, the Court may be pleased to strike off this execution case keeping the attachment in force."" Neither the original nor a certified copy of the order made on that date by the executing Court on the 576 above petition is forthcoming but the parties have definite ly agreed that the order is substantially and correctly entered in column 20 of exhibit F which is a certified copy of extract from the Register of applications for executions of decrees relating to execution Case No. 118 of 1936.
The heading of column 20 is 'Date on which execution case was finally disposed of and purport of final order.
"" The entry in column 20 under that head is: ""D. H. admits receipt of Rs. 76 14/ as costs of this case from the J.D.
The execution case is dismissed for non prosecution the attachment already effected in this case continuing.
30th January 1937.
"" The entry under column 11 of that very exhibit reads as follows : ""Claim case automatically drops as the execution case is dismissed.
It is, therefore, rejected without any sort of adjudication.
30th January 1937.
"" In May 1937, the Searsole Raj Estate came under the charge of the Court of Wards.
By a Kobala executed with the permission of the Board of Revenue Raja Pramatha Nath Malia and his two sons Kumars Pashupati Nath Malia and Kshitipati Nath Malia represented by Kumar Kshitipati Nath Malia as the Manager of the Searsole Raj Wards Estate conveyed a property known as Senapati Mahal to Deva Prasanna in full settlement of his claim under the personal decree against the Raja.
By an agreement of even date, Deva Prasanna agreed to reconvey Senapati Mahal to the Kumars if he was paid Rs. 90,000/ within two years from that date.
Senapati Mahal orginally belonged to the Raja but had been tranSferred by him to his two sons.
A creditor, however, had filed a suit under sec tion 53 of the Transfer of Property Act challenging that transfer and had actually got a decree declaring that trans fer as fradulent and void as against the creditors of the Raja 577 An appeal was filed by the Kumars which was pending at the date of the Kobala of January 4, 1939, and, in the circum stances, it was considered safer to join the Raja in the last mentioned Kobala in favour of Deva Prasanna.
On June 2, 1939, a petition was filed in the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Asansole, on behalf of Deva Prasanna as the decree holder.
It was headed ""Money Execution Case No. 118 of 1936.
The relevant portions of this petition were as follows; ""That the above execution case was disposed of on the 30th January 1937 with the attachment of the properties subsisting; since then the decree put into execution in the above case has been adjusted after remission of a large amount of interest by the out and out sale of certain properties by a registered Kobala dated 4th January 1939 . . . . . . . . .So there is no longer any need of the said attachment remaining subsisting.
It is, therefore, prayed that the attachment may be withdrawn.
"" On the same day the following order was made on that petition: "" Heard learned pleaders for the parties.
They jointly ask me to cancel the attachment (existing by special order) in Money exhibit 118 of 1936 though that case was dismissed.
Order The said attachment is cancelled and the decree in question is recorded as adjusted as stated by learned plead er for the decree holder and pleader of the judgment debtor according to the adjustment mentioned but not detailed in this petition of to day.
Make necessary notes and send this petition to the District Record Room.
"" In the remarks column No. 22 in exhibit F the following entry was made : ""The said attachment is cancelled and the decree in question is recorded as adjusted as stated by learned 578 pleader for the D.H. and the pleader of the Judgment Debtor according to the adjustment mentioned but not detailed in this petition of to day.
Dated 2nd June 1989.
"" The Raja died in August, 1940, leaving the two appellants as his sons and legal representatives.
The Bengal Money Lend ers Act, 1940 (Bengal Act X of 1940) hereinafter called the Act, came into force on September 1, 1940.
On January 2, 1941, the appellants who, as the legal representatives of the Raja, became ""borrowers"" within the meaning of the Act filed the suit out of which the present appeal has arisen.
The suit was filed by the appellants against the respondent under section 36 of the Act praying for reopening the trans actions and taking accounts and for release from all liabil ities in excess of the limits specified by law.
In short, they asked the Court to give them relief by exercising the powers given to the Court by section 36 of the Act.
There was also a prayer for reconveyance of the Senapati Mahal.
The respondent filed his written statement setting up a variety of defences rounded on merits as well as on legal pleas in bar.
On May 8, 1941, the Subordinate Judge settled the issues and fixed June 9, 1941, ""for a preliminary hear ing of the suit and particularly of such of the issues as have been based on the pleas in bar."" Eventually, the case was taken up for preliminary hearing on September 4, 1941, and by his judgment delivered on September 8, 1941, the learned Subordinate Judge dismissed the suit on issue No. 2 which was as follows: ""Does the plaint disclose a valid cause of action for the suit ?"" The appellants preferred an appeal to the High Court at Calcutta.
Although the High Court (R.C. Mitter and K.C. Chunder JJ.) did not accept all the reasonings on which the learned Subordinate Judge had based his decision, they, however, agreed that the appellants could get no relief as the decrees in suit No. 78 of 1922 could not be reopened, as they were not passed in 579 ""a suit to which this Act applies"" and consequently dis missed the appeal.
The appellants have now come up on appeal before us after having obtained a certificate from the High Court under section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Learned Advocate appearing in support of this appeal before us has contended that the High Court was in error in holding that the decrees in Suit No. 78 of 1922 were not liable to be reopened under the second proviso to section 36 (1).
Learned advocate for the respondent while joining issue on this point also raised a point which, however, did not find favour with the High Court, namely, that the respondent as a bona fide assignee for value of the mortgage debt was protected by sub section (5) of section 36.
It is quite clear that if either of the two points is decided against the appellants, this appeal must fail.
The main provisions of section 36 (1)are in the follow ing terms : ""Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, if in any suit to which this Act ap plies, or in any suit brought by a borrower for relief under this section, whether heard ex parte or otherwise, the Court has reason to believe that the exercise of one or more of the powers under this section will give relief to the bor rower, it shall exercise all or any of the following powers as it may consider appropriate namely, shall (a) reopen any transaction and take an account between the parties; (b) notwithstanding any agreement, purporting to close previous dealings and to create new obligations, reopen any account already taken between the parties; (c) release the borrower of all liability in excess of the limits specified in clauses (t) and (2) of section 30; (d) if anything has been paid or allowed in account on or after the first day of January, 1939, in respect of the liability referred to in clause (c), order 580 the lender to repay any sum which the Court considers to be repayable in respect of such payment or allowance in account as aforesaid; (e) set aside either wholly or in part or revise or alter any security given or agreement made in respect of any loan, and if the lender has parted with the security, order him to indemnify the borrower in such manner and to such extent as it may deem just.
"" It will be noticed (a) that the provisions of this section apply notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force, (b) that the powers conferred on the Court or to be exercised either in any suit to which this Act applies or in any suit brought by a borrower for relief under the section and (c) that the Court is called upon to exercise all or any of the powers conferred on it by the section if the Court has reason to believe that the exercise of one or more of the powers will give relief to the borrower.
In the present case the borrowers have insti tuted a substantive suit for relief under section 36 and, therefore, if there was nothing also in the section and the Court had the requisite belief, the Court could exercise all or any of the powers and give relief to the borrowers in terms of the prayers of the plaint.
There are, however, two provisions to sub section (1) of section 36.
The relevant portion of the second proviso is expressed in the words following: ""Provided that in exercise of these powers the Court shall not (i) * * * * (ii) do anything which affects any decree of a Court, other than a decree in a suit to which the Act applies which was not fully satisfied by the first day of January, 1939, or * * * *"" The proviso makes it quite clear that in exercise of the powers the Court cannot reopen or otherwise affect a decree of a Court unless such decree is one which was passed in a suit to which this Act applies and ' which was not fully satisfied by January 1, 1939.
In the light of the decision of the Full Bench of the 581 Calcutta High Court in Mrityunjay Mitra vs Satis Chandra Banerji(1) which was approved by the Privy Council in Jadu Nath Roy vs Kshitish Chandra Acharyya(2), it has not been contended, in view of the fact that the personal decree for the balance remained unsatisfied on January 1, 1939, that the decrees in Suit No. 78 of 1922 were fully satisfied within the meaning of the above proviso.
Therefore, the only thing that remains to be ascertained is whether the decrees were passed in ""a suit to which this Act applies.
"" Section 2 (22) of the Act is as follows: ""2.
In this Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context"" (22) ""Suit to which this Act applies ""means any suit or proceeding instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of January, 1939, or pending on that date and includes a pro ceeding in execution (a) for the recovery of a loan advanced before or after the commencement of this Act; (b) for the enforcement of any agreement entered into before or after the commencement of this Act, whether by way of settlement of account or otherwise, or of any security so taken, in respect of any loan advanced whether before or after the commencement of this Act; or (c) for the redemption of any security given before or after the commencement of this Act in respect of any loan advanced whether before or after the commencement of this Act.
"" The words ""instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of January, 1939, or pending on that date"" have been read and understood as qualifying the words ""any suit or proceed ing"" in the beginning of the definition as well as the words ""proceeding in execution"" occurring further down: see per Spens C.J. in Bank of ' Commerce Ltd. vs Amulya Krishna (3).
Accordingly, it has (1) I.L.R. 11944) 2Cal. 376; (2) L.R. 76 I.A. 179 at p. 190.
(3) ;A.I.R. 1944 F.C. 18.
582 been held in Ram Kumar De vs Abhoya Pada Bhattacharjee (1) that where a decree is such that the suit in which it was passed had terminated before January 1, 1939, and no pro ceeding in execution was started or was actually pending on or after that date it is not a decree in ""a suit to which this Act applies""and cannot be reopened.
The same view was upheld by a Special Bench of the Calcutta High Court in Aparna Kumari vs Girish Chandra (2)which overruled two earlier decisions to the contrary.
The construction put upon section 2 (22)by the Special Bench and the reasons given by them appear to us to be well founded.
In the case now before us, the Suit No. 78 of 1922 was instituted and all the three decrees were passed long before the specified date.
The only question that has therefore, to be consid ered is whether any proceeding in execution was pending on or after that date.
The answer to this question will depend on the true meaning and effect of the orders made by the executing Court (i) on January 30, 1937, and (ii) on June 2, 1939.
As to (i) It is not disputed that the order of January 30, 1937, was made under Order XXI, rule57, as amended by the Calcutta High Court.
Order XXI, rule 57, is expressed in the following terms : ""Where any property has been attached in execution of a decree but by reason of the decree holder 's default the Court is unable to proceed further with the application for execution, it shall either dismiss the application or for any sufficient reason adjourn the proceedings to a future date.
Upon the dismissal of such application the attachment shall cease.
"" The marginal note of the rule is determination of at tachment.
The reason why rule 57 was introduced in the Code of 1908 has been explained by Rank in C.J. in Shibnath Singh Ray vs Sheikh Saberuddin Ahmad(3) as follows: (1) ; (2) (3) I.L.R. at pp.
421 422 583 ""Rule 57 of Order XXI was a new provision introduced in 1908.
It is evident from the language of the rule itself, and it is still more evident from the circumstances under which it was passed, that it was intended to provide a remedy for the grievance or inconvenience which is apt to arise, where, after an attachment in execution, the applica tion for execution cannot further be proceeded with by reason of the decree holder 's default.
This was, and still is, a very common case.
The decree holder makes some informal arrangement to give the judgment debtor time with out obtaining full satisfaction of the decree ;the applica tion for execution is not further prosecuted; it is not withdrawn; neither party attends.
In these circumstances, the object of the rule is to say that the Court must make either an order for adjournment or an order of dismissal.
The reason why it was necessary to require the Court, if it did not adjourn a proceeding to a definite date, to dismiss the application for execution formally and definitely can be amply illustrated from the decided cases.
In the absence of a definite order of dismissal the files of the Courts became encumbered with a number of applications for execution which were water logged and derelict, and a practice arose whereby such applications were ordered to be 'struck off. ' This was a practice not justified by the Code and in cases where attachments in execution had already been entered, the question arose whether the effect of an order 'striking off ' was that the attachment made upon application for execution was itself struck off or whether it remained notwithstanding such an order.
Many other awkward and important questions arose out of this practice and the object of rule 57 was to ensure that this illogical and inconvenient practice should be stopped.
Applications for execution were to be definitely dismissed if they were not adjourned to a future date.
The object of the last sentence in rule 57 is to settle the question whether, when the application in execution is dismissed any attachment made under that application should fall to the ground or should subsist, and 584 the legislature has provided that it is to fall to the ground.
"" The new rule thus ' introduced left two distinct courses open to the executing Court in the situation envisaged by the rule.
Each course had its advantage as well as its disadvantage.
Thus the adjournment of the execution pro ceedings kept the attachment alive without any special direction.
While the adoption of this course helped bona fide arrangement between the decree holder and the judgment debtor as to the time and manner of satisfaction of the decree it was calculated also to encourage desultory proceedings resulting in undesirable congestion in the files of the Executing Court by keeping alive so many execution proceedings.
On the other hand, while the dismissal of an application in the circumstances mentioned in the rule had the merit of preventing a congestion of the file by finally disposing of the application by a final order, it was calcu lated to discourage decreeholders from giving even reasona ble accommodation to the judgment debtor on account of the destruction of the attachment which left the judgment debtor free to deal with the property to the detriment of the decreeholder after the attachment ceased.
It was evidently with a view to preserve the advantage of a dismissal and at the same time to avoid the disadvantage of the rigid rule of cesser of the attachment that the Calcutta High Court amend ed rule 57 by adding the words ""unless the Court shall make an order to the contrary"" at the end of the last sentence of that rule.
The rule thus amended leaves three courses open to the Executing Court in case it finds it difficult to proceed with the execution case by reason of the default of the decree holder.
It may (1) adjourn the proceedings for good reason which will automatically keep the attachment alive or (2) simply dismiss the application which will automatically destroy the attachment or (3) dismiss the application but specifically keep alive the attachment by an express order.
The rule, as amended, therefore, contemplates three distinct forms of order, any one of which may be made by the Court in the 585 circumstances mentioned in the rule.
The question before us is as to the category in which the order made on January 30, 1937, in Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 falls.
It will be recalled that the order of January 30, 1937, was made on a petition (Exhibit 2) filed on that day in Execution Case No. 118 of 1936.
Great stress was laid by the learned advocate for the appellants on the words ""struck off for the present"" occurring in the body of that petition.
It will be noticed that those words formed part of the request of the judgmentdebtor which was being recited in the petition.
In the actual prayer portion the decree holder did not use the words ""for the present"" but only asked the Court ""to strike off the execution case keeping the attachment in force.
"" Further, apart from what the parties wanted, the Court made its intention clear in the very order that it passed and which is entered in column 20 of Exhibit F.
The Court regarded the willingness of the the decree holder to enter into a long and protracted negotiation with the judg ment debtor as evidence of unwillingness on the part of the decree holder to diligently prosecute the execution proceedings and accordingly dismissed the execution case for non prosecution but thought fit to expressly keep alive the attachment.
It is quite obvious that the Court made an order of the third kind mentioned above.
The three forms of order permissible under rule 57 as amended by the High Court are quite distinct and independent of each other and there is no room for their overlapping.
If the mere continuation of attachment will automatically convert an express order of dismissal of the execution application which is a final order into an order of adjournment which is not a final order then there was no point in the High Court taking the trouble of amending rule 57 at all.
The Court could by simply adjourning the proceedings automatically continue the attachment without any express direction in that behalf.
The fact that the Court gave an express direction that the attachment should continue clearly indicates that the 586 Court intended to make a final order of dismissal.
Again, the heading of column 20 in Exhibit F clearly indicates that only a final order is to be entered in that column.
The fact that the order was entered in that column affords some justification for the conclusion that the Court made a final order of dismissal.
That the claim case was automatically dropped is yet another indication that the execution case was at an end.
The fact that the judgment debtor had paid the full costs of the execution case is also a feature which goes to show, to a certain extent at any rate if not deci sively, that the execution proceeding was finally disposed of by the order.
The following endorsement appears on the petition exhibit 2 (a), dated June 2, 1939: ""Heard learned pleaders for the parties.
They jointly ask me to cancel the attachment (existing by special order) in Money exhibit 118 of 1936 though that case was dismissed."" This endorsement also clearly shows that the Court itself understood that the order that it made on January 30; 1937, was a final order of dismissal and that the attachment had been continued by a special order.
On a consideration of all these matters I have not the least doubt in my mind that the order of January 30, 1937, was in form and in substance a final order of dismissal of the Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 and that the attachment was continued by a special order such as is contemplated and authorised by the amend ment made by the Calcutta High Court in rule 57.
Learned advocate for the appellants contended that if the execution case came to an end the attachment could not be left hanging in the air.
There is no substance in this argument.
Ordi narily, an attachment is supported by an execution case and if the execution case is simply dismissed the attachment must fail with it.
But rule 57, as amended, expressly empow ers the Court to dismiss an execution application but at the same time to keep alive the attachment by a special order.
That is what was done in this case.
Here the attachment does not, to use the expression of the learned advocate for the appellants, 587 hang in the air.
It rests upon the solid foundation of a special order which rule 57, as amended, in terms authorises the Court to make.
The continuance of the attachment, in the circumstances, needs no execution proceeding to support it.
Take the case of an attachment before judgment.
Under Order XXXVIII, rule 11, where after an order of attachment before judgment a decree is passed in favour of the plaintiff, it is not necessary upon an application for execution of such a decree to apply for re attachment of the property.
It means that the attachment continues and the judgmentdebtor cannot deal with the property to the disadvantage of the decree holder.
After the decree is passed, the attachment continues but nobody will say that although there has been no applica tion for the execution of the decree at any time by the decree holder there is, nevertheless, an execution proceed ing pending merely because the attachment continues.
Here also the attachment subsists and rests only upon the terms of Order, XXXVIII rule 11, and without any proceeding.
Such attachment cannot be called a proceeding in execution, for none was ever initiated after the decree was passed.
In my judgment, the order of January 30, 1937, was a final order which brought the Execution Case No. 118 of 1936, to an and and the attachment continued, not because there was a pend ing execution proceeding but because a special order was made under Order XXI, rule 57, as amended by the High Court.
As to (ii) Learned advocate for the appellants then contended that the petition (exhibit 2a) dated June 2, 1939, amounted to a proceeding in execution and as that was insti tuted and was pending after January 1, 1939 the proceedings came within the definition in section 2 (22)of ""a suit to which this Act applies"".
I do not think this argument is sound.
The petition (Ex.2a) was not really an application at all.
See Raja Shri Prakash Singh vs The Allahabad Bank Ltd. (1).
In substance, it was nothing but a certification by the decree holder of the satisfaction of the decree.
The mere fact (1) 33 C.W.N. 267; A.I.R. 1929 P.C. 19, 588 that the document was in the form of a petition could not convert what was really the usual certifying procedure into a proceeding in execution for recovery of a loan or for enforcement of any agreement.
It was purely an intimation given to the Court by the decreeholder that the decree had been satisfied out of Court and the prayer for withdrawal of the attachment was merely consequential and would follow as a matter of course on full satisfaction of the decree being recorded.
The order made on that petition also shows that the decree was recorded as adjusted and the attachment was cancelled.
In my judgment, that petition (exhibit 2a) was not an application such as would initiate a proceeding in execution for any of the purposes mentioned in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of section 2 (22) of the Act.
For reasons stated above, the decrees sought to be reopened were not decrees made in ""a suit to which this Act applies"".
Suit No. 78 of 1922 was neither instituted on or after January 1, 1939, nor was it pending on that date, all the three decrees having been passed long before that date.
Nor was any proceeding in execution such as is contemplated by section 2 (22) instituted or pending on or after that date.
The Execution Case No. 118 of 1936 was at an end on January 30, 1937, and the petition of June 2, 1939, was not an application at all and was certainly not a proceeding in execution within the meaning of section 2 (22) of the Act.
This conclusion is sufficient to dismiss this appeal and it is not necessary for us to consider the other question raised by the respondent on the strength of section 36 (5) of the Act and I express no opinion on that question.
The result is that this appeal must stand dismissed with costs and I order accordingly.
KANIA C.J. I agree.
PATANJALI SASTRI J.
The facts bearing on the dispute in this appeal are fully stated in the judgment of ray brother Das which I have had the advantage of reading and it is unnecessary to recapitulate them here.
589 The appellant mortgagor seeks in these proceedings the reliefs provided by the Bengal Money lenders Act, 1940 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) in respect of a decree debt payable by him.
The respondent who represents the sub mortgagee decree holder invokes the protection of two exemptions contained in the Act: (1) Section 86 (1), proviso (ii), which exempts inter alia ""any decree other than a decree in a suit to which this Act applies which was not fully satisfied by the first day of January, 1939"".
This raises a dispute as to whether the respondent 's decree was passed in a suit to which the Act applies.
(2) Section 36 (5) which exempts ""the rights of any assignee or holder for value if the Court is satisfied that the assignment to him was bona fide and that he had not received the notice re ferred to in clause (a) of sub section (1) of section 28"".
This raises the question whether a sub mortgagee is an assignee within the meaning of the Act.
On the first question ""a suit to which this Act applies"" is defined in section 2 (22) as meaning ""any suit or pro ceeding instituted or filed on or after the 1st day of Janu ary, 1939, or pending on that date and includes a proceeding in execution for (among other things) the recovery of a loan advanced before or after the commencement of this Act.
"" This definition has been construed as requiring that the ""pro ceeding in execution ""referred to therein should be pending on 1st January, 1939, and the question accordingly arises whether the order of the executing court dated 30th January, 1937, which purported to dismiss the respondent 's execution case for non prosecution while continuing the attachment already effected, terminated the proceeding in execution which had resulted in the attachment.
It was said that the order was made in accordance with Order XXI, rule 57, of the Civil Procedure Code as amended by the Calcutta High Court and must, therefore, be taken to have been intended to put an end to the execution proceeding altogether.
I am not satisfied that such was the result of the dismissal.
The amendment which added the words ""unless the court shall make an order to the contrary"" 200 at the end of the rule envisages a dismissal of an ""applica tion for execution"" while at the same time continuing a subsisting attachment.
The dismissal of 30th January, 1987, must, therefore, be taken to be a dismissal of the execution application then before the court and cannot be taken to have any wider operation.
On the other hand, the continu ance, in express terms, of 'the attachment notwithstanding the dismissal, indicates that the proceeding which had resulted in the attachment was kept alive to be carried forward later on by sale of the attached property.
Attachment itself is a ""proceeding in execution"" and, so long.as it subsists, the p","A decree on a mortgage was passed in a suit brought by the representatives in interest of a sub mortgagee in 1929 and a personal decree for recovery of the amount remaining due after the sale of the mortgaged properties was passed in 1935.
In 1936 the decree holder started execution of the personal decree and attached certain properties of the judgment debtor.
The decree holder filed a petition on January 30, 1937, praying that the execution case ""may be struck off for non prosecution, keeping the attachment in force"" in view of certain negotiations for amicable settle ment, and the court passed an order that the execution case ""is dismissed for non prosecUtion, the attachment 573 already effected continuing"".
On June 2, 1939, the decree holder filed a petition stating that the decree had been adjusted and attachment may be withdrawn.
The Bengal Money lenders Act came into force on September 1, 1940, and on January 2, 1941, the legal representatives of the judg ment debtor filed a suit under section 36 of the Act praying for re opening the transactions.
The question being whether any proceeding for execution was pending on or after January 1, 1939, within the meaning of the definition of ""a suit to which this Act applies"" contained in section 2 (22) of the Bengal Money lenders Act: Held, per KANIA C.J. and DAs J. That the order of January 30, 1937, was in form and in substance a final order of dismissal of the execution petition of 1936.
The attach ment continued not because there was a pending execution proceeding but because a special order for continuing the attachment was made under O. 21, r. 57 of the Civil Proce dure Code as amended by the Calcutta High Court, and not withstanding the fact that the attachment was continued there was no execution proceeding pending on January 1, 1939, and accordingly the decree sought to be reopened was not one passed in ""a suit to which the Act applies"" within the meaning of section 2 (22) of the Act and the Court had no power to re open the transactions under section 36 (2).
The petition of June 2, 1939, was also not a proceeding for execution but a mere certification by the decree holder of satisfaction of the decree.
PATANJALI SASTRI J.
The continuance of the attachment notwithstanding the dismissal of the execution petition, indicated that the proceeding which had resulted in the attachment was kept alive to be carried forward later on by sale of the attached property.
Attachment itself is ""a proceeding in execution"" and so long as it subsists, the proceeding in execution can well be regarded as pending.
In this view a proceeding in execution was pending on January 1, 1939, and the decree must be taken to have been passed in ""a suit to which this Act applies "".
But inasmuch as the sub mortgage to the respondent 's predecessor in title was bona fide and he obtained by virtue of the sub mortgage the right to sue the original mortgagor for recovery of the mortgage debt, the decree holder was a bona fide assignee and his claim for the entire decree debt was protected by section 36 (5) of the Act.

Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated the 24th February, 1953, of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta in Appeal from Original Order No. 19 of 1952, arising out of the Order dated the 23rd day of August, 1951, of the High Court of Calcutta in its Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction Matter No. 157 of 1951.
K. P. Khaitan, (section N. Mukherjea and Rajinder Narain, with him) for the appellant.
M. C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India, (A. N. Sen, V. section Sawhney and section P. Varma, with him) for the respondents.
November 1.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
This appeal is directed against a judgment of an appellate bench of the Calcutta High Court, dated the 24th February, 1953, reversing, on appeal, the judgment and order of a single Judge sitting on the Original Side of that Court, passed on an application under section 34 of the .
The material facts are not in controversy and may be shortly stated as follows: On the 7th of July, 1950, the respondent, Moran and Company Limited, passed two Bought Notes to the appellant company, couched in identical terms, under which the appellant purchased 12,00,000 yards of hessian cloth, 6,00,000 yards under each contract, on certain terms and conditions stated therein.
The delivery was to be made every month from January, 1951, at the rate of 1,00,000 yards per month under 864 each of these notes and payments were to be made in cash 'on delivery, each delivery being treated as a separate and distinct contract.
The Bought Notes commenced thus: Dear Sirs, We have this day Bought by your order and on your account from our Principals.
"" The particulars of the goods, the price, the time of delivery and other terms of the contract are then set out and amongst the terms is an arbitration clause worded as follows: "" All matters, questions, disputes, differences and/ or claims arising out of and/or concerning and/or in connection with and/or in consequence of or relating to this contract, whether or not the obligations of either or both parties under this contract be subsisting at the time of such dispute and, whether or not this contract has been terminated or purported to be terminated or completed, shall be referred to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce under the rules of its Tribunal of Arbitration for the time being in force and according to such rules the arbitration shall be conducted.
"" The notes were signed by the respondent, Moran and Company, describing themselves as brokers.
It is admitted that the goods covered by the Bought Notes were delivered to the appellant in all the months from January to June, 1951, with the exception of the goods due to be delivered for the month of March, 1951.
The appellant required from the respondent delivery of goods in respect of the month of March but the latter informed the appellant, by a letter dated the 27th March, 1951, that its principals disowned a liability in this respect as there was default on the part of the appellant in not giving shipping instructions for the said goods within the time mentioned in the contracts.
The appellant denied any default on its part and did not also accept the position that the respondent had any principal, and on the 27th of April, 1951, it sent its bills to the respondent claiming Rs. 1,13,042 3 0 as damages for non delivery of the 865 goods.
As the respondent did not comply with this demand, the appellant contemplated referring the matter in dispute to the arbitration of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce as provided in the contracts and while it was preparing to take steps in that direction, the respondent, on the 11th of June, 1951, filed a suit against the appellant in the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court (being Suit No. 2516 of 1951,) and it is in respect of this suit that the application under section 34 of the has been made.
It was alleged in the plaint that the plaintiff acted merely as broker and in that capacity brought about the two contracts of sale and purchase evidenced by the two Bought Notes mentioned above, that the real seller was a firm known as Gowarchand Danchand, and that the plaintiff not being a party to the contract could not incur any liability under its terms.
There were prayers in the plaint for a declaration that the plaint.
off was not a party to the said contracts and, that it had no liability under the same.
There was a further prayer for an injunction restraining the respondent from, claiming any damages in respect of the said contracts The writ of summons was served on the appellant on the 23rd of June, 1951.
On the 19th July, 1951, it filed an application under section 34 of the praying that the proceedings in the suit may be stayed in order that the matter in dispute between the parties may be dealt with under the arbitration clause contained in the contracts.
The application was heard by Das Gupta J. who allowed the prayer of the applicant and stayed further proceedings in the suit.
In the opinion of the learned Judge the dispute in this case was not whether there was any contract entered into by and between the appellant and the respondent: but whether the respondent, who admittedly passed the two Bought Notes to the appellant, could be made liable under the contract by reason of the fact that it described itself as broker.
The answer to this question depended according to the learned Judge upon the interpretation of the contract itself and the dispute arising as.
it did out of or concerning or relating to the 866 contracts would come within the purview of the arbitration clause.
Against this judgment the respondent took an appeal to the Appellate Division of the High Court and the appeal was heard by a bench consisting of Chakravartti C.J. and Sarkar J.
By two separate judgments which concurred in the result, the Chief Justice and the other learned Judge allowed the appeal and vacated the order for stay.
It is against this judgment that the appellant has come to this Court on the strength of a certificate under article 133(1)(a) of the Constitution.
The short point for our consideration is, whether on the facts of this case, the appellant is entitled to an order under section 34 of the , staying the proceedings of the suit commenced by the respondent.
Section 34 of the is in these terms: "" Where any party to an arbitration agreement or any person claiming under him commences any legal proceedings against any other party to the agreement or any person claiming under him in respect of any matter agreed to be referred, any party to such legal proceedings may, at any time before filing a written statement or taking any other steps in the proceedings, apply to the judicial authority before which the proceedings are pending to stay the proceedings; and if satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred in accordance with the arbitration agreement and that the applicant was, at the time when the proceedings were commenced, and still remains, ready and willing to do all things necessary to the proper conduct of the arbitration, such authority may make an order staying the proceedings.
"" Thus in order that a stay may be granted under this section, it is necessary that the following conditions should be fulfilled: (1)The proceeding must have been commenced by a party to an arbitration agreement against any other party to the agreement; (2)the legal proceeding which is sought to be.
stayed must be in respect of a matter agreed to be referred 867 (3)the applicant for stay must be a party to the legal proceeding and he must have taken no step in the proceeding after appearance.
It is also necessary that he should satisfy the Court not only that he is but also was at the commencement of the proceedings ready and willing to do everything necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration; and (4)the Court must be satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to an arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement.
The third condition can be taken to have been fulfilled on the facts of the present case, and the fourth is one which is exclusively for the determination of the Court.
The controversy between the parties centres round the other two conditions, namely, conditions (1) and (2) ; and unless the applicant for stay succeeds in establishing that the respondent is a party to an arbitration agreement and that the subject matter of dispute in the suit is a matter coming within the scope of such agreement, it cannot possibly ask the Court to order a stay of the proceedings, under section 34 of the .
The learned Judges of the appellate bench of the High Court have taken the view that the only matter in dispute between the parties to the suit is whether the plaintiff was a party to the contract.
It was definitely alleged by the plaintiff that the contract was not between it and the appellant but was one between the appellant and a third party and since the arbitration agreement is contained in the contract, it is an agreement between those parties only, which could not bind or affect the plaintiff in any way.
The dispute, it is said, which is the subject matter of the suit does not arise under the contract and does not relate to it; it is outside the contract altogether and does not come within the scope of the arbitration agreement.
The decision in the appeal therefore rests entirely on the finding of the learned Judges that the matter in dispute between the parties to the suit does not come within the ambit of the arbitration clause.
In view of this decision the learned Judges did not consider it necessary to go into the first point as to whether in fact 868 there was a binding arbitration agreement between the parties to the suit.
The learned Chief Justice no doubt did in a manner consider that point also, but he refrained from pronouncing any decision upon it, being of opinion that a decision on this question which was the only issue in the suit itself might prejudice the parties and create a bar of res judicata against one or the other.
We think that on the facts of this case it was necessary for the learned Judges of the appellate bench to decide the question as to whether or not the plaintiff in the suit which the applicant wants to stay was a party to the arbitration agreement.
This would have a material bearing on the decision of the other question upon which the learned Judges rested their judgments.
The first and essential pre requisite to making an order of stay under section 34 of the is that there is a binding arbitration agreement between the parties to the suit which is sought to be stayed.
The question whether the dispute in the suit falls within the arbitration clause really pre supposes that there is such agreement and involves consideration of two matters, viz., (1) what is the dispute in the suit and (2) what disputes the arbitration clause covers?(1).
The contention raised by the plaintiff in the present suit is, that the contract was really between the appellant and another party and not between it and the appellant and consequently it was not bound by the contract and could not be made liable for any damages in terms thereof.
In substance therefore the controversy between the parties in the suit is whether the plaintiff did incur any liability in terms of the contracts evidenced by the two Bought Notes to which it was a signatory no matter in whatever capacity.
The question whether the plaintiff was a party to the agreement at all is undoubtedly one which cannot go before the arbitrators and with that question they cannot possibly deal.
But as Lord Porter pointed out in Heyman vs Darwins (2), ""this does not mean that in every instance (1) Vide per Viscount Simon in Heyman vs Darwins, at 360.
(2) , 393.
869 in which it is claimed that the arbitrator has no juris diction the Court will refuse to stay an action.
If this were the case such a claim would always defeat an agreement to submit disputes to arbitration, at any rate until the question of jurisdiction had been decided.
The Court to which an application for stay is made is put in possession of the facts and arguments and must in such a case make up its mind whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction or not as best it can on the evidence before it.
Indeed, the application for stay gives an opportunity for putting these and other considerations before the court that it may determine whether the action shall be stayed or not.
"" Section 34 of the as is well known is a virtual reproduction of section 4 of the English of 1889.
The observations quoted above were approved of by Mr. Justice section R. Das in the case of Khusiram V. Hanutmal (1) and it was held by the learned Judge that where on an application made under section 34 of the for stay of a suit, an issue is raised as to the formation, existence or validity of the con.
tract containing the arbitration clause, the Court is not bound to refuse a stay but may in its discretion, on the application for stay, decide the issue as to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement even though it may involve incidentally a decision as to the validity or existence of the parent contract.
We are in entire agreement with the view enunciated above.
As we have said already, it is incumbent upon the Court when invited to stay a suit under section 34 of the to decide first of all whether there is a binding agreement for arbitration between the parties to the suit.
So far as the present case is concerned if it is held that the arbitration agreement and the contract containing it were between the parties to the suit, the dispute in the present suit would be one relating to the rights and liabilities of the parties on the basis of the contract itself and would come within the purview of the arbitration clause worded as it is in the widest of terms, in accordance with the principle enunciated by this Court in A. M. Nair and (1) at 518.
870 Company vs Gordhandass (1).
If on the other hand it is held that the plaintiff was not a party to the agreement, the application for stay must necessarily be dismissed.
The appellate Judges of the High Court in our opinion held rightly that the decision in A. M. Mair and Company vs Gordhandass (1) was not in any sense conclusive in the present case on the question of the dispute in the suit being included in the arbitration agreement.
The report shows that the dispute in that case was whether the appellants had made the contract in their own right as principals or on behalf of the Bengal Jute Mill Company as agents of the latter.
The decision of this question was held to turn upon a true construction of the contract and consequently it was a dispute under or arising out of or concerning the contract.
The judgment proceeds on the footing that there was in fact a contract between the parties and the only dispute was in which character they were parties to it, the respondents contending that the appellants were not bound as principals while the latter said that they were.
Mr. Justice Fazl Ali in delivering the judgment pointed out that the error into which the learned Judges of the appellate bench of the High Court appeared to have fallen was their regarding the dispute raised by the respondent in respect of the position of the appellants under the contract as having the same consequence as a dispute as to the contract never having been entered into.
In this case it is certainly not admitted that the respondent was a party to the contract.
In fact that is the subject matter of controversy in the suit itself.
But, as has been said already, the question having been raised , in this application, under section 34 of the , the Court has undoubted jurisdiction to decide it for the purpose of finding as to whether or not there is a binding arbitration agreement between the, parties to the suit.
It has been said by Chakravartti C.J. and in our opinion rightly, that if the person whose concern with the agreement is in question is a signatory to,the contract and formally a (1) ; 871 contracting party, that will be sufficient to enable the Court to hold for purposes of section 34 that he is a party to the agreement.
It was the contention of the respondent in the Court below that this test was not fulfilled in the present case.
The point has been canvassed before us also by Mr. Sen and it has been argued on the authority of several decided cases that in cases of this description the Bought Note is a mere intimation to the buyer, that the orders of the latter have been carried out and purchases have been made from other persons and not from them.
The writer does not thereby become a party to the contract of purchase and sale even as an agent.
He remains a mere broker or intermediary and the provision of section 230(2) of the Contract Act 'Cannot be invoked against him.
Mr. Khaitan on the other hand argues that the English law being quite different from the Indian law regarding the liability of an agent contracting on behalf of an undisclosed principal, the English authorities are no guide to a solution of the problem.
It is said that the case of Patiram Banerjee vs Kanknarrah Co., Ltd.(1), upon which the respondent relies, was wrongly decided being based upon English authorities which have no application to India.
The respondent here, it is pointed out, signed an elaborate document setting out in full every particular of the contract entered into and it is impossible to say that he was not an agent executing a contract on behalf of another whose identity he did not disclose but was a mere intermediary conveying an information to the buyer.
In our opinion, the point is not free from doubt and requires careful consideration and as it was not decided by the learned Judges of the High Court and we have not the advantage of having their views upon it, the proper course for us to follow would be to send the case back for a hearing of and decision on this point.
We, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the judgments of both the Courts below.
The matter will go back to the appellate bench of the Calcutta High Court which will decide as an issue in the proceeding under section 34 of the the question whether the respondent was or was not a party (1) Cal.
I050. 872 to the arbitration agreement.
If the Court is of opinion that the respondent was in fact a party, the suit shall be stayed and the appellant would be allowed to, proceed by way of arbitration in accordance with the arbitration clause.
If on the other hand the finding is adverse to the appellant, the application will be dismissed.
The appellant will have its costs of this appeal.
Further costs between the parties will abide the result.
Appeal allowed.
","Held, that in order that a stay may be granted under section 34 of the Indian , it is necessary that the following conditions should be fulfilled: (1) The proceeding must have been commenced by a party to an arbitration agreement against any other party to the agreement; (2) the legal proceeding which is sought to be stayed must be in respect of a matter agreed to be referred ; (3) the applicant for stay must be a party to the legal proceeding and he must have taken no step in the proceeding after appearance.
It is also necessary that he should satisfy the court not only that he is, but also was at the commencement of the proceedings, ready and willing to do everything necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration ; and (4) the Court must be satisfied that there is no sufficient reason why the matter should not be referred to an arbitration in accordance with the arbitration agreement.
The first and essential pre requisite to making an order of stay under a. 34 of the is that there is a binding arbitration agreement between the parties to the suit which is sought to be stayed.
The question whether the dispute in the suit falls within the arbitration clause really pre supposes that there is such agreement and involves consideration of two matters, viz., (1) what is the dispute in the suit and (2) what disputes the arbitration clause covers.
It is incumbent upon the Court, when invited to stay a suit under section 34 of the Indian , to decide first of all whether there is a binding agreement for arbitration between the parties.
If, in the present case, it is held that the arbitration agreement and the contract containing it were between the parties to the suit, the dispute in the present suit would be one relating to the rights and liabilities of the parties on the basis of the contract itself and would come within the purview of the arbitration clause 863 worded as it is in the widest of terms.
If, on the other hand, it is held that the plaintiff was not a party to the agreement, the application for stay must necessarily be dismissed.
Case sent back for the decision of the question whether the respondent was or was not a party to the arbitration agreement.

December 18.
The leading judgment was delivered by Bose J. Fazl Ali J. agreed, 180 Bose J.
This is a defendant 's appeal in a suit for contribution brought by the son of a mortgagor against the co mortgagors.
The parties are related as below : Balai Lall Seal (died1917) I Megharnala Dassi (died 1945) I I I I I Bejoy Lall Biswa Lall Tarak Lall Kedar Lall NakuLall (D. 23 5 33) (D. Nov. 1936) Deft 1 Deft. 2 (Born (Born I I Jugal Lall Hari Lall 22 11 1907) 7 2 1910) (Plff.) The mortgagors were the plaintiff 's father Tarak Lall and Tarak 's two brothers Kedar and Naku.
The mortgage was exe cuted on the 12th June, 1936, in favour of one Mst.
Gyarsi for a consideration of Rs. 80,000.
For convenience I will call this the suit mortgage though this is not a suit on the mortgage.
The mortgagee sued in the year 1938 and obtained a preliminary decree for sale on the 17th of February, 1939, for a sum of Rs. 89,485 12 9 plus costs.
The decree was made final on the 22nd of December, 1989.
In execution the mortgagee proceeded against the proper ty of the plaintiff alone (as Tarak 's son) and, during the pendency of the execution, assigned her rights in the decree to the Hooghly Flour Mills.
The Mills continued the execu tion and on the 11th of March, 1943, the claim was satisfied in this way.
An order of the Court was obtained sanctioning sale of a part of the mortgaged property, 20 Round Tank Lane (which belonged exclusively to the plaintiff), to the decree holder for a sum of Rs. 1,50,000.
It was directed that the consid eration should first be applied in payment of the claim and costs and that the decreeholder should execute a reconvey ance of the rest of the mortgaged properties in favour of the mortgagors.
The sanction of the Court was necessary because the judgment debtor Hari Lall (present plaintiff) was a minor.
181 This was done and 20, Round Tank Lane, was conveyed by the present plaintiff to the Hooghly Flour Mills on the 18th of March, 1943.
Out of the consideration a sum of Rs. 97,116 11 0 was paid to the Mills in lull satisfaction of the claim and costs then outstanding.
The Mills executed a reconveyance of the rest of the properties to the mortgagors in release of the mortgage on the same day.
In addition to this Rs. 97, 116 11 0, further sums of Rs. 14,400 and Rs. 8,100 had also been paid before the dates of these transactions.
These sums were paid by a Receiver who had been appointed by the Court pendente lite.
These sums came out of the rents which the Receiver obtained from the plaintiff 's property, 20 Round Tank Lane.
The plaintiff says that in this way he paid a total of Rs. 1,19,116 11 0 in satisfaction of the mortgage.
His one third share in this comes to Rs. 39,872 3 8.
He claims that he is entitled to receive the balance of Rs. 79,744 7 4 from the two defendants and that each of them is liable for a half of that sum namely, Rs. 39,872 3 8.
In addition to this the plaintiff had incurred costs amounting to Rs. 1,144 8 6 in resisting Mst.
Gyarsi 's claim and in connection with the reconveyance.
He also claims one third of this sum, namely Rs. 381 8 2, from each of the defendants.
The total claim against each defendant accord ingly comes to Rs. 40,253 11 10.
In addition to this the plaintiff asked for (1) ""a declaration that the properties mentioned in Schedule 'A '. belonging to the defendants stand charged with the repayment of the sum of Rs. 80,507 7 8 being the aggregate amount due and payable by the two defendants,"" and (2) ""Decree under Order XXXIV of the Civil Procedure Code in proper form."" Schedule A contains a list of the rest of the mortgaged properties which belong exclusively to the defendants, 24 182 It will be seen that the plaintiff claims on the basis that each of the three mortgagors is liable to contribute in equal shares towards payment of the mortgage debt.
The defendants did not deny their liability to contribute.
They only challenged the basis on which it was to be comput ed.
They ,pleaded a special agreement between Tarak Lal and themselves under which their liabilities were to be calcu lated in the following way.
According to them, the bulk of the Rs. 80,000 was borrowed on what I have called the suit mortgage to pay off previous debts which had been incurred by the parties on earlier mortgages.
The amount which went towards satisfaction of the defendant 's portion of these earlier liabilities was only Rs. 13,259 2 4.
Therefore, the only benefit they got out of this Rs. 80,000 was to that extent.
The plaintiff 's father Tarak on the other hand benefitted to the extent of Rs. 53,481 11 4.
They therefore agreed at the date of the suit mortgage that their respec tive liabilities as between themselves should be proportion ate to the benefit derived by each as above.
Sinha J., who tried the suit on the Original Side of the Calcutta High Court, held that the agreement was proved.
On appeal the learned Chief Justice of the High Court and Chatterjee J. disagreed and held that it was not.
As I agree with the learned appellate Judges for reasons which I shall give hereafter, it will be necessary to set out the further facts.
But I need not do so in any detail as they are given in full in the two judgments of the High Court.
We are only concerned here with the question of principle; so it will be more convenient to reduce the problem to its simplest terms.
We are concerned here with four items of property which I shall term Chittaranjan Avenue, Strand Road, No. 16 Round Tank Lane and 20 Round Tank Lane.
These properties were originally joint family properties, but in the year 1932 there was a partition which was compelled by reason of a suit filed by Tarak 183 against his brothers and mother.
The upshot was that the properties were divided as follows: (1) Bejoy, Kedar, Naku and the mother Meghamala obtained Chittaranj an Avenue.
(2) Tarak (plaintiff 's father) obtained 16 Round Tank Lane and 20 Round Tank Lane.
(3) Kedar, Naku and Biswa Lall obtained Strand Road.
Before this partition there were three mortgages: The first of these was executed on the 16th of June, 1925.
All five brothers joined in it and they mortgaged the Strand Road property for Rs. 10,000.
This was in favour of Bhuvan Chandra Bhur.
The second was on the 11th of October, 1926.
In this Bejoy and Tarak mortgaged their 2/5 share in Chittaranjan, Strand, Dum Dum and 20 Round Tank Lane for Rs. 5,000.
The mortgagee was Binode Behari Sen.
The third was on the 28th January, 1927.
In this Bejoy and Tarak again mortgaged their 2/5 share in the same items of property for Rs. 7,000 to Binode Behari Sen and Kunja Behari Sen.
All three sets of mortgagees, or their representatives, instituted suits on their respective mortgages and obtained final decrees Bejoy died on the 23rd of May, 1933, leaving a son Jugal.
On the 12th of June, 1936, came what I have called the suit mortgage executed by the three brothers,Tarak, Kedar and Naku, for Rs. 80,000.
The properties mortgaged were (1) the shares of Kedar and Naku in Chittaranjan Avenue and 16 Round Tank Lane; (2) 20 Round Tank Lane which had been allotted to Tarak; (3) the reversionary interest of all three in the share allotted to the mother.
The consideration of Rs. 80,000 was expended as follows:Rs.
29,667 10 0 was paid by Tarak, Kedar and Naku in satisfaction of the first mortgage and the 184 later decretal charge; Rs. 11,519 11 0 in satisfaction of the second and Rs. 13,502 14 0 in satisfaction of the third.
The balance of Rs. 25,310 is alleged by the appellants to have been retained by Tarak.
I have taken these figures from the judgments of the High Court.
I understand some of the details are disputed, so I make it clear that I am not setting out the decision of this Court regarding the de tails but only giving an overall picture.
Shorn of overburdening detail the problem, reduced to its simplest terms, comes to this.
Three persons A, B and C separately own properties of unequal value, Blackman, Whiteacre and Greenacre.
Let us assume that their values at the material date are Rs. 30,000, Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 10,000 respectively.
A, B and C, acting in various combinations from time to time, incur debts.
It matters not for present purposes whether those debts are secured on these properties or not because a time must come when their separate liabilities as amongst themselves have to be ascertained and apportioned.
Let us assume that when that is done, A 's responsibility extends to Rs. 2,000, B 's to Rs. 3,000 and C 's to Rs. 5,000.
In order to clear off these debts, A, B and C jointly mortgage their three estates for Rs. 10,000, the total aggregate sum due at the date of the mortgage from the three of them.
There is no contract between them, either in the mortgage deed or otherwise, regarding their respective shares of responsibility in the Rs. 10,000.
At the date of redemption the mortgage debt has swollen to Rs. 15,000.
A alone redeems by selling Blackacre, which is his separate estate, to the mortgagee for Rs. 35,000 that being the value of Blackacre at the date of redemption.
Rs. 15,000 of this is applied in satisfaction of the mortgage debt and the balance of Rs. 20,000 is retained by A.
What are A 's rights as against B and C ? Three solutions readily suggest themselves.
One is that the three contribute equally.
In that event B would pay A Rs. 5,000 and C would pay Rs. 5,000.
185 A second solution is that they pay in proportion to the extent of the benefits derived.
In that event B 's share would be 3/10 of Rs. 15,000, that is to say, Rs. 4,500.
and C 's would be 5/10 of Rs. 15,000, that is Rs. 7,500.
A third solution is that they pay proportionately to the values of the properties mortgaged.
In that event B would have to pay 2/6 of Rs. 15,000, that is Rs. 5,000, and C 1/6 of Rs. 15,000 ' which come to Rs, 2,500.
The problem is to know which of these three solutions to apply.
In the absence of other considerations, the most equitable solution is obviously the second.
But the matter is not as simple as that.
There are certain statutory provi sions which must first be examined.
The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent con tended that section 43 of the Contract Act applied.
He relied on the following provision : ""Each of two or more joint promisors may compel every other joint promisor to contribute equally with himself to the performance of the promise, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract.
If any one of two or more joint promisors makes default in such contribution, the remaining joint promisors must bear the loss arising from such default in equal shares.
"" The argument is that unless a contrary intention appears from ""the contract"" the.
loss must be borne equally.
It was contended, and with that I agree, that the words ""the con tract"" can only refer to the main contract between the promisors on the one side and the promisee on the other.
That contract in this case is the suit mortgage.
There is no contract to the contrary in the document, therefore, it was contended, the section must apply.
That of course would be the clear, logical and simple conclusion ii there were no other provision of law to consider.
But we are dealing here with a mortgage and so we have also to look to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act.
186 Incidentally, if this argument is pushed to its logical conclusion it would exclude any collateral or subsequent agreement between the promisors inter se which does not appear in the main contract.
But we need not enter into that here.
The sections of the Transfer of Property Act which concern us are 82 and 92.
The first confers a right of contribution.
The second a right of subrogation.
I will consider section 82 first.
It runs : ""Where property subject to a mortgage belongs to two or more persons having distinct and separate rights of owner ship therein, the different shares in or parts of such property owned by such persons are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, liable to contribute rateably to the debt secured by the mortgage . . "" That is the position here.
Next I turn to section 92.
That runs "" . any co mortgagor shall, on redeeming property subject to the mortgage, have, so far as regards redemption, foreclosure or sale of such property, the same rights as the mortgagee whose mortgage he redeems may have against the mortgagor . "" That also applies.
Now these provisions at once raise a competition between sections 82 and 92 of the Transfer of Property Act, section 43 of the Contract Act and what I might term the principle of beneficial, as opposed to proportionate or equal, distri bution of liability.
I am of opinion that the second solution adumbrated earlier in this judgment, based on equities, must be ruled out at once.
These matters have been dealt with by statute and we are now only concerned with statutory rights and cannot in the face of the statutory provisions have recourse to equitable principles however fair they may appear to be at first sight.
The Privy Council pointed out in Rani Chhatra Kumari vs Mohan Bikram (1) that the doctrine of the (1) Pat. 851 at 869.
187 equitable estate has no application in India.
So also refer ring to the right of redemption their Lordships held in Mohammad Sher Khan vs Seth Swami Dayal(1) that the right is now governed by statute, namely section 60, Transfer of Property Act.
Sulaiman c.
J. (later a Judge of the Federal Court) ruled Court equitable considerations in the Allahabad High Court in matters of subrogation under sections 91, 92, 101 and 105, Transfer of Property Act, in Hira Singh vs Jai Singh(2) and so did Stone C.J. and I in the Nagpur High Court in Taibai vs Wasudeorao (3).
In the ease of section 82 the Privy Council held in Ganesh Lal vs Charan Singh(4) that that section prescribes the conditions in which contribution is payable and that it is not proper to introduce into the matter any extrinsic principle to modify the statutory provisions.
So, both on authority and principle the deci sion must rest solely on whatever section is held to apply.
So far as section 43 is concerned, I am not prepared to apply it unless sections 82 and 92 can be excluded.
Both sections 43 and 82 deal with the question of contribution.
Section 43 is a provision of the Contract Act dealing with contracts generally.
Section 82 applies to mortgages.
As the right to contribution here arises out of a mortgage, I am clear that section 82 must exclude section 43 because when there is a general law and a special law dealing with a particular matter, the special excludes the general.
In my opinion, the whole law of mortgage in India, including the law of contribution arising out of a transaction of mort gage, is now statutory and is embodied in the Transfer of Property Act read with the Civil Procedure Code.
I am clear we cannot travel beyond these statutory provisions.
Now, when parties enter into a mortgage they know, or must be taken to know, that the law of mortgage provides for this very question of contribution.
It confers rights on the mortgagor who redeems and directs that, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, he (1) (1922) 49 I.A. 60 at Nag. 206 at 216.
(2) A.I.R. 1937 All.
588, at 594.
(4) (1930) 57 I.A. 189.
188 shall be reimbursed in a particular way out of particular properties.
The parties are at liberty to vary these rights and liabilities by special contract to the contrary but if they do not do so, I can see no reason why these provisions should be abrogated in favour of a section in the Contract Act which does not deal with mortgages.
Slightly to vary the language of the Judicial Committee it is the terms and nature of the transaction viewed in the light of the law of mortgage in India which exclude the personal liability and therefore section 43, except where there is a contract to the contrary.
It was suggested that the rule is inequitable and will operate harshly in cases like the present.
But the remedy lies in the parties ' own hands.
It is open to them to make a contract to the contrary.
If they do not, then the law steps in and makes statutory rules to which effect must be given.
It is not for judges to consider whether that is the best possible solution but the rule at any rate obviates the necessity of roving enquiries into the objects of a borrow ing and the application of the funds.
On an overall basis it is perhaps as good as any other.
But that hardly matters.
The rule is there and full effect must be given to it.
The learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent urged that the defendants are shut out from relying on section 82 because that was not their case and the question was never raised by them in the High Court.
Such reference as there is to the section was with reference to an argument urged on behalf of the plaintiff.
I am not impressed with this objection.
, On the facts set out by the plaintiff it is evident that he is entitled to contribution.
The method of computation is a matter of law and it is for the judges to apply the law to the facts stated and give the plaintiff such relief as is appropriate to the case.
I turn now to the question of fact, the special agree ment pleaded by the defendants.
The only evidence in sup port of it is that of the first defendant Kedar.
According to him, the agreement was an oral one 189 though the parties contemplated writing and registration.
His explanation for lack of any writing is this.
He was asked whether anything was put down in writing and he re plied : ""No, nothing was done then, but there was an understand ing that it would be done but Tarak went away to Darjeeling and when he came back he died soon after he came back and nothing could be done in writing.
"" Later, he was asked ""Therefore, you, contemplated that there would be a document which would have to be registered in connection with the adjustment ?"" and he replied ' 'Yes"".
He also tells us that the parties regarded the matter as confidential and so only three per sons were present, Tarak, Naku and himself.
It is to be observed that Naku, who is the second defendant, has not entered the box.
Stopping there, it is evident that we have to rely on the memory of a very interested person speaking nearly thirteen years after the event about a transaction affecting some Rs. 80,000.
Nor is it the memory of some simple event which might well have fixed itself in his mind.
The question whether and at what stage parties reach finality when writ ing is in contemplation is a difficult and complex one involving delicate considerations of much nicety even when the preliminaries are all in writing.
The turn of a phrase here, the use of a word there, may make a world of differ ence.
The law regarding this was examined by me at some length in the Nagpur High Court in Shamjibhai vs Jagoo Hernchand Shah (1).
How much greater are the difficulties when we do not know the exact words the parties used and have to delve into the mind of a dead man (Tarak) through the impressions of an interested witness given some thirteen years after the event.
I find it difficult to accept this version and consider it would be dangerous to do so, particularly when the (1) I.L.R. at 586 588, and 598 25 190 witness is a hesitant and reluctant one, as his examination discloses, and even evasive on some points; also when the defendants have deliberately withheld from the Court assist ance which it was in their power to render I refer to the absence of Naku, the only other person present, from the box.
I am unable to accept this testimony.
Nor is this the only point.
Despite the insistence of the witness that the parties were on good terms and trusted each other, the fact remains that Tarak found it necessary to institute a suit for partition against his brothers and fight it to a finish.
They were not able to arrange matters amicably.
it was suggested in argument that was probably because of creditors who could not be persuaded to agree and it was pointed out that creditors were joined in the suit, but that is not wholly convincing particularly when it is admitted that Tarak was insisting on writing and regis tration.
It is evident that he, at any rate, was not prepared to leave matters as they were and trust to the good faith of his brothers.
Now we know that Tarak was in Calcutta about three months after the date of the alleged agreement.
We also know that Kedar was most anxious to have such an agreement, for he tells us so.
He tells us further that there was before them a rough draft of the terms.
That document was produced in Court.
But the draft was neither signed nor initialled.
The only inference I can draw from these facts is that Tarak either refused to agree or had not made up his mind.
The figures put forward by the defendants were contested on behalf of the plaintiff and we were given an alternative set of figures which in turn were contested by the other side, but they were enough to show that the matter is not as straightforward or as simple as the defendants would have us believe.
Therefore, Tarak 's inaction during the three months and the omission of either side to initial the draft point clearly, at the lowest, to hesitancy on Tarak 's part.
It may be he wanted his lawyers to examine his position or it may be he refused to have anything to do with it.
191 It is just possible that there were negotiations, but on those broad facts I am not prepared to believe the witness when he tells us, or rather suggests, that the parties reached finality.
It would in any event be dangerous to believe a witness in circumstances like this.
But when the defendants deliberately withheld from the Court that assist ance which is its due I can only conclude that their case was too shaky to stand further proving.
On these broad grounds alone I would hold that the agreement is not proved.
Much was made in argument about the rule regarding the weight to be given to the estimate of the judge who saw and heard a witness.
I do not doubt the soundness of the rule but it can be pushed too far as their Lordships of the Judicial Committee pointed out in Virappa vs Periakaruppan(1).
In the present case, the learned Judge who tried the case believed Kedar not because of his demea nour but because the learned Judge considered that his story was inherently probable.
That, however, is a matter which the learned appellate Judges were in as good a position to appreciate as the learned trial Judge.
If probability is to be the test, then the conduct of Tarak suggests that it is very improbable that he could have agreed.
That leaves at large the nature of the relief to which the plaintiff is entitled.
In the view I take, there being no contract to the contrary, the plaintiff 's only remedy is under section 92 of the Transfer of Property Act read with section 82.
The question is, has his suit been so framed ? The plaintiff has claimed separate personal reliefs against the defendants.
As there is no personal covenant as between the mortgagors or any ""contract to the contrary"", that relief ' cannot be granted.
The plaintiff has also asked for a declaration of charge and for a decree under Order XXXIV, Civil Procedure Code.
The declaration of charge standing by itself is superfluous although Order XXXIV, rule 2 (1) does require that the decree in a mortgage suit shall (1) A.I.R. 1945 P.C. 35 at 37.
192 ""declare the amount so due"" at the date of the decree.
But reading the two reliefs together, I am of opinion that though the claim is inartistically worded the plaintiff has in substance asked for a mortgage decree up to a limit of Rs. 40,253 11 10 with interest against each defendant.
No other kind of decree could be given under Order XXXIV.
Therefore, though he has not used the word ""subrogation"" he has asked in substance for the relief to which a subrogee would be entitled under the Transfer of Property Act.
I would be slow to throw out a claim on a mere techni cality of pleading when the substance of the thing is there and no prejudice is caused to the other side, however clum sily or inartistically the plaint may be worded.
In any event, it is always open to a court to give a plaintiff such general or other relief as it deems just to the same extent as if it had been asked for, provided that occasions no prejudice to the other side beyond what can be compensated for in costs.
In the circumstances, in the absence of agreement be tween the parties as to the figures, I would remand this case to the High Court for (1) an enquiry regarding the sum paid by the plaintiff 's father for satisfaction of the mortgage dated the 12th June, 1936, (2) for the interest due on that sum at the contract rate in the mortgage from the date of payment to the date of decree, (a) lot the values of the various properties mortgaged at the date of the mort gage.
When the figures are ascertained, I would direct that the liability of each defendant be ascertained separately in the manner prescribed by section 82, Transfer of Property Act.
the event of this liability exceeding Rs. 40,253 11 10 with interest against either defendant, I would direct that his liability be reduced to Rs. 40,253 11 10 plus interest.
When these figures are ascertained, I would direct that a mortgage decree for sale be drawn up in the usual way affording either defendant the right to redeem the whole of the balance of the property 193 (excluding the plaintiff 's) for the aggregate sum due as above and, in default of payment, limiting the liabilities of each item of property to the sum rateably due on it under section 82.
On the question of costs.
The plaintiff repudiated section 82 in the course of the arguments before us and rested his case on section 43 of the Contract Act, nor did he clearly and unmistakably plead a case of subrogation in his plaint even in the alternative.
The defendants, on the other hand, set up a case which has failed on the facts.
I would, therefore, direct each side to bear its own costs in this appeal.
As regards the costs incurred in the Courts below and any costs which may be necessitated by a further enquiry, they will be determined according to the final result of the litigation and with due regard to all matters bearing on the question of costs.
FAZL ALI J.
I agree.
Case remanded.
","The right to contribution as between co mortgagors is governed by sections 82 and 92 of the Transfer of Property Act and not by section 43 of the Indian Contract Act, inasmuch as section 43 of the Contract Act deals with contracts generally, while sections 82 and 92 of the Transfer of Property Act specifically deal with the right of contribution between co mortgagors.
It is an established principle that when there is a general law, and a special dealing with a particular matter, the special excludes the general.
Consequently, in the absence a contract to the contrary, co mortgagors are bound to con tribute proportionately to the value of the shares or parts of the mortgaged property owned by them and not in propor tion to the extent of the benefits derived by each of them.
As sections 82 and 92 of the Transfer.

The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by PATANJALI SASTRI C.J.
This is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution submitted through the Super intendent, Central Jail, Ambala, for the issue of a writ of habeas corpus for the release of the petitioner from custo dy.
On 5th July, 1950, the petitioner was arrested and detained under an order of the District Magistrate of Amrit sar in exercise of the powers conferred on him under section 3 of the , and the grounds of his detention were served on him as required by section 7 of the Act on 10th July, 1950.
The Act having been amended by the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, with effect from 22nd February, 1951, a fresh order No. 7853 ADSB, dated 17th May, 1951, was issued in the following terms : ""Whereas the Governor of Punjab is satisfied with re spect to the person known as Naranjan Singh Nathawan, s/o Lehna Singh of village Chak Sikandar, 397 P.S. Ramdas, Amritsar District, that with a view to prevent ing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of the State, it is necessary to make the following order: Now, therefore.
in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (1) of section 3 and section 4 of the Preven tive Detention Act, 1950, as amended by the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, the Governor of Punjab hereby directs that the said Naranjan Singh Nathawan be committed to the custody of the Inspector General of Pris ons, Punjab, and detained in any jail of the State till 31st March, 1952, subject to such conditions as to maintenance, discipline and punishment for breaches of discipline as have been specified by general order or as contained in the Punjab Detenu Rules, 1950.
"" This order was served on the petitioner on 23rd May, 1951, but no grounds in support of this order were served on him.
The petitioner thereupon presented this petition for his release contending that the aforesaid order was illegal inasmuch as (1) the grounds of detention communicated to him on 10th July, 1950, were ""quite vague, false and imaginary"" and (2) he was not furnished with the grounds on which the order dated 17th May, 1951, was based.
The petition was heard ex parte on 12th November, 1951, when this Court issued a rule nisi calling upon the respondent to show cause why the petitioner should not be released, and it was posted for final hearing on 23rd November, 1951.
Meanwhile, the State Government issued an order on 18th November, 1951.
revoking the order of detention dated 17th May, 1951, and on the same date the District Magistrate, Amritsar, issued yet another order for the detention of the petitioner under sections a and 4 of the amended Act; this last order along with the grounds on which it was based was served on the petitioner on 19th November, 1951.
Thereupon the petitioner submitted a supplemental peti tion to this Court on 28th November, 1951, challenging the validity of the last order on the ground 398 that ""it was only a device to defeat the habeas corpus petition of the petitioner in which a rule had already been issued , and he put forward an additional ground of attack on the legality of the earlier order dated 17th may, 1951, namely, that it fixed the term of detention till 31st March, 1952, before obtaining the opinion of the Advisory Board as required by section 11 of the amended Act.
This ground was evidently based on the view expressed by this Court that the specification of the period of detention in the initial order of detention under section 3 of the amended Act before obtaining the opinion of the Advisory Board rendered the order illegal.
In the return to the rule showing cause filed on behalf of the respondent, the Under Secretary (Home) to the Govern ment explained the circumstances which led to the issue of the fresh order of detention dated 18th November, 1951.
After stating that the petitioner 's case was referred to and considered by the Advisory Board constituted under section 8 of the amended Act and that the Board reported on 30th May, 1951, that there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner, the affidavit proceeded as follows: ""That the Government was advised that the orders made under section 11 of the , as amended by the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1951, but carried out in the form of orders under section 3 of the said Act, should be followed by grounds of detention and, as this had not been done in most cases, the detentions were likely to be called in question.
The Government was further advised there were other technical defects which might render the detention of various detenus untenable.
In view of this, the Government decided that the cases of all dete nus should be reviewed by the District Magistrates con cerned.
Accordingly, the Punjab Government instructed the District Magistrates to review the cases and apply their minds afresh and emphasised that there must exist rational grounds with the detaining authority to justify the deten tion of a person and they were asked to report clearly in each case if the District 399 Magistrate concerned wanted the detenus to be detained.
The Punjab Government also reviewed some cases.
Accordingly all cases including the case of the petitioner were reviewed and in this case the District Magistrate was again satisfied that it was necessary that the detenu be detained with a view to prevent him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the security of the State and the maintenance of public order."" And it concluded by stating ""that the petitioner is detained now under the orders of the District Magistrate, Amritsar.
"" The original and supplementary petitions came on in due course for hearing before Fazl Ali and Vivian Bose JJ.
on 17th December, 1951, when reliance was placed on behalf of t he petitioner on certain observations in an unreported decision of this Court in Petition No. 334 of 1951 (Naranjan Singh vs The State of Punjab) and it was claimed that in view of those observations and of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution, the decision in Basant Chandra Ghose vs King Emperor(1), on which the respondent relied.
was no longer good law.
The learned Judges thought that the matter should be considered by a Constitution bench and the case was accordingly placed before us.
It will be seen from the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent that the case of the petitioner, along with his representation against the detention order of 17th May, 1951, was placed before the Advisory Board for its consider ation, and the Board reported on 30th May, 1951, that in its opinion there was sufficient cause for the detention of the petitioner.
It is said that, on the basis of that report, the Government decided that the petitioner should be de tained till 31st March, 1952, but while a properly framed order under section 11 should ""confirm"" the detention order and ""continue"" the detention for a specified period, the order of 17th May, 1951, was issued under a misapprehension in the form of an initial order under section 3 of the amended Act.
on the same grounds as before without any fresh communication thereof to the petitioner.
To (1) 52 400 avoid arguments based on possible defects of a technical and formal character, the said order was revoked under section 13, and on a review of the case by the District Magistrate, a fresh order of detention was issued under section 3 on 18th November, 1951, and this was followed by a formal communication of the same grounds as before as there could be no fresh grounds, the petitioner having throughout been under detention.
It is contended by the Advocate General of the Punjab that the decision reported in is clear authority in support of the validity of the aforesaid order.
On essentially similar facts the court laid down two propo sitions both of which have application here.
(1) Where an earlier order of detention is defective merely on formal grounds, there is nothing to preclude a proper order of detention being based on the pre existing grounds them selves, especially in cases in which the sufficiency of the grounds is not examinable by the courts, and (2) if at any time before the court directs the release of the detenu, a valid order directing his detention is produced, the court cannot direct his release merely on the ground that at some prior stage there was no valid cause for detention.
The question is not whether the later order validates the earli er detention but whether in the face of the later valid order the court can direct the release of the petitioner.
The learned Judges point out that the analogy of civil proceedings in which the rights of parties have ordinarily to be ascertained as on the date of the institution of the proceedings has no application to proceedings in the nature of habeas corpus where the court is concerned solely with the question whether the applicant is being lawfully de tained or not.
The petitioner 's learned counsel conceded that he could not challenge the correctness of the second proposition, but took exception to the first as being no longer tenable after the Indian Constitution came into force.
It was urged that article 22 lays down the procedure to be followed in cases of preventive detention and the said procedure must be strictly observed 401 as the only prospect of release by a court must be on the basis of technical or formal defects, a long line of deci sions having held that the scope of judicial review in matters of preventive detention is practically limited to an enquiry as to whether there has been strict compliance with the requirements of the law.
This is undoubtedly true and this Court had occasion in the recent case of Makhan Singh Tarsikka vs The State of Punjab (Petition No. 308 of 1951)(1) to observe ""it cannot too often be emphasised that before a person is deprived of his personal liberty the procedure established by law must be strictly followed and must not be departed from to the disadvantage of the person affected"".
This proposition, however, applied with equal force to cases of preventive detention before the commence ment of the Constitution, and it is difficult to see what difference the Constitution makes in regard to the position.
Indeed, the position is now made more clear by the express provisions of section 13 of the Act which provides that a detention order may at any time be revoked or modified and that such revocation shall not bar the making of a fresh detention order under section 3 against the same person.
Once it is conceded that in habeas corpus proceedings the court is to have regard to the legality or otherwise of the detention at the time of the return and not with reference to the date of the institution of the proceeding, it is difficult to hold, in the absence of proof of bad faith, that the detaining authority cannot supersede an earlier order of detention challenged as illegal and make a fresh order wherever possible which is free from defects and duly complies with the requirements of the law in that behalf.
As regards the observations in Naranjan Singh 's case, we do not understand them as laying down any general proposi tion to the effect that no fresh order of detention could be made when once a petition challenging the validity of an earlier order has been filed in court.
The learned Judges appear to have inferred from the facts of that case that the later order was (1) Since reported as ; 402 not made bona fide on being satisfied that the petitioner 's detention was still necessary but it was ""obviously to defeat the present petition"".
The question of bad faith, if raised would certainly have to be decided with reference to the circumstances of each case, but the observations in one case cannot be regarded as a precedent in dealing with other cases.
We accordingly remit the case for further hearing.
This order will govern the other petitions where the same ques tion was raised.
Petitions remitted.
","In the absence of bad faith the detaining authority can supersede an earlier order of detention which has been challenged as defective on merely formal grounds and make a fresh order wherever possible which is free from defects and duly complies with the requirements of the law in that behalf.
The question of bad faith, if raised, must be decided with reference to the circumstances of each case.
In habeas corpus proceedings the Court is to have regard to the legality or otherwise of the detention at the time of the return and not with reference to the date of the institution of the proceedings.

The following judgments were delivered.
KANIA C.J. This is a reference made by the President of India under article 143 of the Constitution asking the Court 's opinion on the three questions submitted for its consideration and report.
The three questions are as fol lows: ""(1) Was section 7 of the , or any of the provisions thereof and in what particular or particu lars or to what exent ultra vires the Legislature which passed the said Act ?"" Section 7 of the , mentioned in question, runs as follows : 756 ""The Provincial Government may, by notification in the official gazette, extend with such restrictions and modifi cations as it thinks fit to the Province of Delhi or any part thereof, any enactment which is in force in any part of British India at the date of such notification.
"" ""(2) Was the Ajmer Merwara (Extension of Laws) Act, 1947, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particu lar or particulars or to what extent ultra vires the Legis lature which passed the said Act ?"" Section 2 of the Ajmer Merwara (Extension of Laws) Act, 1947, runs as follows: ' 'Extension of Enactments to Ajmer Merwara.
The Cen tral Government may, by notification in the official ga zette, extend to the Province of Ajmer Merwara with such restrictions and modifications as it thinks fit any enact ment which is in force in any other Province at the date of such notification.
"" ""(3) Is section 2 of the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950, or any of the provisions thereof and in what particu lar or particulars or to what extent ultra vires the Parlia ment ?"" Section 2 of the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950, runs as follows : ""Power to extend enactments to certain Part C States.
The Central Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, extend to any Part C State (other than Coorg and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands) or to any part of such State, with such restrictions and modifications as it thinks fit, any enactment which is in force in a Part A State at the date of the notification and provision may be made in any enactment so extended for the repeal or amend ment.
of any corresponding law (other than a Central Act) which is for the time being applicable to that Part C State.
"" The three sections referred to in the three questions are all in respect of what is described as the delegation of.
legislative power and the three particular Acts are selected to raise the question in respect of the three main stages in the constitutional development of India.
757 The first covers the legislative powers of the Indian Legis lature during the period prior to the Government of India Act, 1915.
The second is in respect of its legislative power after the Government of India Act, 1935, as amended by the Indian Independence Act of 1947. 'The last is in respect of the power of the Indian Parliament under the present Consti tution of 1950.
It is therefore necessary to have an idea of the legislative powers of the Indian Legislature during those three periods.
Without going into unnecessary details, it will not be out of place to know the historical back ground.
The East India Company first started its operations as a trading company in India and gradually acquired politi cal influence.
The Crown in England became the legislative authority in respect of areas which had come under the control of the East India Company.
The Indian Councils Act of 1861, section 22, gave power to the Governor General in Council, with additional nominated members, to make laws.
The constitutional position therefore was that the British Parliament was the sovereign body which passed the Indian Councils Act.
It gave the Governor General in Council in his legislative capacity powers to make laws over the territo ries in India under the governance of the Crown.
Under the English Constitution the British Parliament with its legis lative authority in the King and the two Houses of Parlia ment is supreme and its sovereignty cannot be challenged anywhere.
It has no written Charter to define or limit its power and authority.
Its powers are a result of convention but are now recognised as completely absolute, uncontrolled and unfettered.
Sir Cecil Cart in his book on English Admin istrative Law at page 15 observes: ""A more basic difference between the Constitutions of the United States and Britain is the notorious fact that Britain has no written Constitu tion, no fundamental statute which serves as a touchstone for all other legislation and which cannot be altered save by.
some specially solemn and dilatory process.
In Britain the King in Parliament is all powerful.
There is no Act which cannot be passed and will not be valid within 758 the ordinary limits of judicial interpretation . .
Even Magna Carts is not inviolate . .
The efficient secret of the English Constitution was the close union and nearly complete fusion of the executive and legislative powers.
In other words by the system of Cabinet Government the executive authority is entrusted to a committee consisting of members of the dominant party in the legisla ture and in the country."" In Halsbury 's Laws of England, Vol.
VI, Article 429, it is further stated that it is for this reason that there is no law which the King in Parliament cannot make or unmake whether relating to the Constitution itself or otherwise; there is no necessity as in States whose Constitutions are drawn up in a fixed and rigid form and contained in written documents for the existence of a judicial body to determine whether any particular legislative Act is within the consti tutional powers of Parliament or not; and laws affecting the Constitution itself may be enacted with the same ease and subject to the same procedure as ordinary laws.
In England, when occasions of conferment of powers on subordinate bodies became frequent and assumed larger scope, questions about the advisability of that procedure were raised and a Commit tee on the Minister 's Powers, what is generally described as the Donoughmore Committee was appointed.
The Committee recommended that certain cautions should be observed by the Parliament in the matter of confermen of such powers on subordinate bodies.
This is natural because of the well recognised doctrine of the English Constitution that Parlia ment is supreme and absolute and no legislation can control its powers.
Such a legislative body which is supreme has thus cer tain principal characteristics.
It is improper to use the word ""constitutional"" in respect of laws passed by such a sovereign body.
The question of constitutionality can arise only if there is some touchstone by which the question could be decided.
In respect of a sovereign body like the British Parliament there is no 759 touchstone.
They are all laws and there is no distinction in the laws passed by the Parliament as constitutional or other laws.
Such laws are changed by the same body with the same ease as any other law.
What law follows from this is that no court or authority has any right to pronounce that any Act of Parliament is unconstitutional.
In Dicey 's Law of the Constitution, 9th Edition, in considering the Constitution of France,it was observed that the supreme legislative power under the Republic was not vested in the ordinary Parliament of two Chambers, but in a National Assembly or Congress composed of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate sitting together.
The Constitutions of France which in this respect were similar to those of Continental polities exhibited as compared with the expansiveness or flexibility of English institutions that characteristic which was described by the author as rigid.
A flexible constitution was one under which every law of every description can legally be changed with the same ease and in the same manner by one and the same body.
The flexibility of the British Constitution consists in the right of the Crown and the two Houses to modify or repeal any law whatever.
They can modify or.repeal in the same manner in which they can pass an Act enabling a company to make a new railway from Oxford to London.
Therefore, in England laws are called constitutional because they refer to subjects proposed to affect the fundamental institutions of the State and not because they are legally more sacred or difficult to change than other laws.
Under the circumstances the term ""constitutional law or enactment"" is rarely applied to any English statute to give a definite description to its character.
Under a rigid constitution, the term ""consti tutional"" means that a particular enactment belongs to the articles of the constitution and cannot be legally changed with the same ease and in the same manner as ordinary laws, and it is because of this characteristic that courts are invested with powers to determine whether a particular legislation is permitted or not by the constitution.
Such a question can 760 never arise in respect of an enactment of the British Parliament.
As against this, the Governor General in Council with legislative powers established under the Indian Councils Act stood in a different position.
Its charter was the Indian Councils Act.
Its powers were there necessarily defined and limited.
That power, again, at any time could be withdrawn, altered and expanded or further curtailed.
Moreover, as the powers were conferred by an Act of the British parliament, the question whether the action of the Governor General in Council in his legislative capacity was within or without its legislative power was always capable of being raised and decided by a court of law.
In Dicey 's Law of the Constitution, 9th Edition the author has distin guished the position of a sovereign legislature and a subordinate law making body.
The distinction is drawn from the fact that the subordinate legislatures have a limited power of making laws.
At page 99, he has specifically considered the position of the legislative Council of British India prior to 1915 and stated as follows: ""Laws are made for British India by a Legislative Council having very wide powers of Legislation.
This Council, or, as it is technically expressed, the Governor General in Council, can pass laws as important as any Acts passed by the Brit ish Parliament.
But the authority of the Council in the way of law making is as completely subordinate to, and as much dependent upon, Acts of Parliament as is the power of the London and North Western Railway Company to make bye laws .
Now observe, that under these Acts the Indian Council is in the strictest sense a non sovereign legisla tive body, and this independently of the fact that the laws or regulations made by the Governor General in Council can be annulled or disallowed by the Crown; and note that the position of the Council exhibits all the marks or notes of legislative subordination.
(1) The Council is bound by a large number of rules which cannot be changed by the Indian legislative body itself and which can be changed by the superior power of the Imperial parliament.
761 (2) The Acts themselves, from which the Council derives its authority, cannot be changed by the Council and. they stand in marked contrast with the laws or regulations which the Council is empowered to make.
These fundamental rules contain, it must be added, a number of specific restrictions on the subjects with regard to which the Council may legis late . (3) The courts in India . may, when the occasion arises, pronounce upon the validity or constitu tionality of laws made by the Indian Council.
"" It is there fore clear that the Indian Legislature in 1861 and upto 1915 was a subordinate legislature and not a sovereign legisla ture.
At this stage it may again be noticed that the Govern ment was unitary and not federal.
There was no distribution of legislative powers as between the Centre and the differ ent Provinces.
Another important factor to be borne in mind is that while the British Parliament was supreme, its execu tive Government came into power and remained in power so long only as the Parliament allowed it to remain and the Parliament itself was not dissolved.
The result is that the executive government was a part of the legislature and the legislature controlled the actions of the executive.
Indeed, the legislature was thus supreme and was in a position effectively to direct the actions of the executive govern ment.
In India the position was quite different if not the reverse.
The Governor General was appointed by the Crown and even after the expansion of the legislative body before the Government of India Act of 1915 in numbers, it had no con trol over the executive.
In respect of the Indian Legisla ture functioning prior to the Government of India Act of 1915 the control from the Secretary of State was justified on the ground that the Provincial Legislatures were but an enlargement of the executive government for the purpose of making laws and were no more than mere advisory bodies without any semblance of power.
The executive Government of India was not responsible to the Indian Legislature and the composition of the Indian Legislature was such that the executive officers 762 together with the nominated members constituted the majority in the Legislature.
The result was that the Legislative Council was practically a creature of the executive Govern ment of India and its functions were practically limited to registering the decrees of the executive government.
It would not be wrong, according to Mr. Cowell in his lecture on ""Courts and Legislative Authorities in India,"" to de scribe the laws made in the Legislative Councils as in reality the orders of Government.
Every Bill passed by the Governor General 's Council required his assent to become an Act.
The Indian Councils Act of 1892 empowered the Governor General in Council, with the approval of the Secre tary of State in Council, to make regulations as to the conditions under which nomination of the additional members should be made.
The word `election ' was carefully avoided.
The existence of a strong official block in the Councils was the important feature of the Act.
As noticed by a writer on Indian Constitution, the Government maintained a tight and close control over the conduct of official members in the Legislature and they were not allowed to vote as they pleased.
They were not expected to ask questions or move resolutions or (in some Councils) to intervene in debate without Government 's approval.
Their main function was to vote to vote with the Government.
However eloquent the non official speakers might talk and however reasonable and weighty their arguments might be, when the time for voting came the silent official flanks stepped in and decided the matter against them.
All these factors contributed to the unreality of the proceedings in the Council because the number of elected members was small and the issue was often known beforehand.
Speaking in the.
House of Lords in Decem ber 1908 on the Bill which resulted in the Government of India Act of 1909, Lord Morley, the then Secretary of State for India, declared: ""If I were attempting to set up a Parliamentary system in India, or if it could be said that this chapter of rules led directly or necessarily up to the establishment of a Parliamentary system in India.
I for one would have 763 nothing at all to do with it . .
A Parliamentary system is not at all the goal to which I would for one moment aspire.
"" The constitution of the Central Legislative Council under the Regulation of November, 1909, as revised in 1912, was this: Ordinary members of the Governor Gene ral 's Council, The Commander in Chief and the Lt. Governor . 8 Nominated members of whom not more than 28 must be officials . 33 Elected members, . 27 and The Governor General . 1 69 The executive government was thus supreme and was not bound to obey or carry out the mandates of the legislature.
Instances where Finance Bills were rejected and other Bills were backed by the popular feeling and which decisions the Governor General overruled, are well known.
The Indian Legislature was powerless to do anything in the matter.
Without the consent of the executive government no Bill could be made into an Act nor an Act could be amended or repealed without its consent.
The possibility of the Legis lature recalling the power given tinder an Act to the execu tive against the latter 's consent was therefore nil.
Once an Act giving such power (like the ) was passed, practically the power was irrevocable.
In my opinion, it is quite improper to compare the power and position of the Indian Legislature so established and functioning with the supreme and sovereign character of the British Parliament.
The legislative power of the Indian Legislature came to be changed as a result of the Act of 1915 by the creation of Provincial legislatures.
I do not propose to go into the details of the changes, except to the extent they are di rectly material for the discussion of the questions submit ted for the Court 's opinion, Diarchy 764 was thus created but there was no federation under the Act of 1915.
Under the Government of India Act, 1935, the legis lative powers were distributed between the Central legisla ture and the Provincial legislature, each being given exclu sive powers in respect of certain items mentioned in Lists I and II of the Seventh Schedule.
List III contained subjects on which it was open to the Centre or the Province to legis late and the residuary power of legislation was controlled by section 104.
This Act however was still passed by the British Parliament and therefore the powers of the Indian Central legislature as well as the Provincial legislatures were capable of being altered, expanded or limited according to the desire of the British Parliament without the Indian legislature or the people of India having any voice in the matter.
Even under this Act, the executive government was not responsible to the Central Legislature or the Provincial Legislature, as the case may be.
I emphasize this aspect because it shows that there was no fusion of legislative and executive powers as was the case with the Constitution in England.
The result of the Indian Independence Act, 1947, was to remove the authority of the British Parliament to make any laws for India.
The Indian Central Legislature was given power to convert itself into a Constituent Assembly to frame a Constitution for India, including the power to amend or repeal the Government of India Act, 1935, which till the new Constitution was adopted, was to be the Constitution of the country.
Even with that change it may be noticed that the executive government was not responsible to the Central Legislature.
In fact with the removal of the control of the Parliament it ceased to be responsible to anyone.
Under the Constitution of India as adopted on the 26th of January, 1950, the executive government of the Union is vested in the President acting on the advice of the Minis ters.
A Parliament is established to make laws and a Su preme Court is established with the powers defined in dif ferent articles of the Constitution.
The executive, legislative and judicial 765 functions of the Government, which have to be discharged, were thus distributed but the articles giving power to these bodies do not vest the legislative or judicial powers in these bodies expressly.
Under the Constitution of India, the Ministers are responsible to the legislatures and to that extent the scheme of the British Parliament is adopted in the Constitution.
While however that characteristic of the British Parliament is given to the Indian Legislature, the principal point of distinction between the British Parlia ment and the Indian Parliament remains and that is that the Indian Parliament is the creature of the Constitution of India and its powers, rights, privileges and obligations have to be found in the relevant articles of the Constitu tion of India.
It is not a sovereign body, uncontrolled with unlimited powers.
The Constitution of India has con ferred on the Indian Parliament powers to make laws in respect of matters specified in the appropriate places and Schedules, and curtailed its rights and powers under certain other articles and in particular by the articles found in Chapter 111 dealing with Fundamental Rights.
In case of emergency where the safety of the Union of India is in danger, the President is given express power to suspend the Constitution and assume all legislative powers.
Similarly.
in the event of the breaking.down of the administrative machinery of a State, the President is given powers under article 257 to assume both legislative and executive powers in the manner and to the extent found in the article.
There can be no doubt that subject to all these limitations and controls, within the scope of its powers and on the subjects on which it is empowered to make law% the Legislature is supreme and its powers are plenary.
The important question underlying the three questions submitted for the Court 's consideration is what is described as the delegation of legislative powers.
A legislative body which is sovereign like an autocratic ruler has power to do anything.
It may, like a Ruler, by an individual decision, direct that a certain person may be put to death or a cer tain property may be 766 taken over by the State.
A body of such character may have power to nominate someone who can exercise all its powers and make all its decisions.
This is possible to be done because there is no authority or tribunal which can question the right or power of the authority to do so.
The contentions urged on behalf of the President of India are that legislative power carries with it a power of delegation to any person the legislature may choose to appoint.
Whether sovereign or subordinate, the legislative authority can so delegate its function if the delegation can stand three tests.
(1) It must be a delegation in respect of a subject or matter which is within the scope of the legis lative power of the body making the delegation.
(2) Such power of delegation is not negatived by the instrument by which the legislative body is created or established.
And (3) it does not create another legislative body having the same powers and to discharge the same functions which it itself has, if the creation of such a body is prohibited by the instrument which establishes the legislative body it self.
It was urged that in the ease of an unwritten consti tution, like the British Parliament there can De no affirm ative limitation or negative prohibition against delegation and therefore the power of delegation is included to the fullest extent within the power of legislation.
The British Parliament can efface itself or even abdicate because it has a power to pass the next day a law repealing or annulling the previous day 's legislation.
When the British Parliament established legislative bodies in India, Canada and Austra lia by Acts of the British Parliament, the legislatures so established, although in a sense subordinate, because their existence depended on the Acts of the British Parliament and which existence could be terminated or further let tered by an Act of the British Parliament, neverthe less are supreme with plenary powers of the same nature as the British Parliament, on the subjects and matters within their respective legislative authority.
As the power of delegation is 767 included in the power of legislation, these legislative bodies have also, subject to the three limitations mentioned above, full power of delegation in their turn.
These legis lative bodies were not agents of the British Parliament.
Not being agents or delegates of the British Parliament, the doctrine delegata potestas non potest delegare cannot apply to their actions and if these legislatures delegate powers to some other authority to make rules or regulations, or authorise the executive government to enforce laws made by them or other legislatures wholly or in part and with or without restrictions or modifications, the legislatures are perfectly competent to do so.
The history of legislation in England and India and the other Dominions supports this contention.
It is recognised as a legislative practice and is seen in several Acts passed by the legislatures of the Dominions and in India.
Such delegation of the legislative functions has been recognised over a series of years by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and it is too late to contest the validity of such delegation.
It was lastly contended that the observations of the Federal Court in Jatindra Nath Gupta vs Province of Bihar(1), tending to show that delegation was not permissible, required to be recon sidered.
Before considering these arguments in detail, I think it is essential to appreciate clearly what is conveyed by the word ""delegation ' '.
That word is not used, either in discus sions or even in some decisions of the courts, with the same meaning.
When a legislative body passes an Act it has exercised its legislative function.
The essentials of such function are the determination of the legislative policy and its formulation as a rule of conduct.
These essentials are the characteristics of a legislature by itself.
It has nothing to do with the principle of division of powers found in the Constitution of the United States of America.
Those essentials are preserved, when the legislature specifies the basic conclusions of fact, upon ascertainment of which, from relevant data, by a designated administrative agency, (1) 768 it ordains that its statutory command is to be effective.
The legislature having thus made its laws, it is clear that every detail for working it out and for carrying the enact ments into operation and effect may be done by the legisla ture or may be left to another subordinate agency or to some executive officer.
While this also is sometimes described as a delegatio","Section 7 of the , provided that ""The Provincial Government may by notification in the official gazette extend, with such restrictions and modifications as it thinks fit, to the Province of Delhi, or any part there of, any enactment which is in force in any part of British India at the date of such notification"".
Section 2 of the Ajmer Merwara (Extension of Laws) Act, 1947, provided that ""The Central Government may, by notification in the official gazette, extend to the Province of Ajmer Merwara, with such restrictions and modifications as it thinks fit, any enact ment which is in force in any other Province at the date of such notification.
Section 2 of the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950, provided that ""The Central Government may, by notification in the official gazette extend to any Part C State . . or to any part of such State, with such restrictions and modifications as it thinks fit, any enact ment which is in force in a Part A State at the date of the notification and provision may be made in any enactment so extended for the repeal or amendment of any corresponding law . which is for the time being applicable to that Part C State.
As a result of a decision of the Federal Court, doubts were entertained with regard to the validity of laws delegating legislative powers to the executive Government and the President of India made a reference to the Supreme Court under article 143 (1) of the Constitution for considering the question whether the above mentioned sec tions or any provisions thereof were to any extent, and if so to what extent 748 and in what particulars, ultra vires the legislatures that respectively passed these laws, and for reporting to him the opinion of the Court thereon: Held, (1)per FAzL ALl, PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA, DAS and Bose JJ., (KANIA C.J., and MAHAJAN J., dissenting).
Section 7 of the , and section 2 of the Ajmer Merwara (Extension of Laws) Act, 1947, are wholly intra vires.
KANIA C.J. Section 7 of the , and section 2 of the Ajmer Merwara (Extension of Laws) Act, 1947, are ultra vires to the extent power is given to the Government to extend Acts other than Acts of the Central Legislature to the Provinces of Delhi and Ajmer Merwara respectively inasmuch as to that extent the Central Legisla ture has abdicated its functions and delegated them to the executive government.
MAHAJAN J.
The above said sections are ultra vires in the following particulars: (i) inasmuch as they permit the executive to apply to Delhi and Ajmer Merwara, laws enacted by legislatures not competent to make laws for those territories and which these legislatures may make within their own legislative field, and (ii) inasmuch as they clothe the executive with co extensive legislative authority in the matter of modification of laws made by legislative bodies in India.
(2) Per FAZL ALI, PATANJALI SASTRI, MUKHERJEA, DAS and BOSE JJ.
The first portion of section 2 of the Part C States (Laws) Act, ;950, which empowers the Central Government to extend to any Part C State or to any part of such State with such modifications and restrictions as it thinks fit any enactment which is in force in a Part A State, is intra vires.
Per KANIA C.J., MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA and Boss JJ.
The latter portion of the said section which empowers the Cen tral Government to make provision in any enactment extended to a Part C State, for repeal or amendment of any law (other than a Central Act) which is for the time being applicable to that Part C State, is ultra vires.
Per FAzL ALI, PATAN JALI SASTRI and DAS JJ.
The latter portion of section 2 of the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950, is also intra vires.
KANIA C.J.
To the extent that section 2 of the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950, empowers the Central Government to extend laws passed by any Legislature of a Part A Slate to a Part C State it is ultra vires.
MAHAJAN J. Section 2 of the Part C States (Laws) Act, 1950, is ultra vires in so far as it empowers the Central Government (i) to extend to a Part C State laws passed by a legislature which is not competent to make laws for that Part C State and (ii) to make modifications of laws made by the legislatures of India and (iii) to repeal or amend laws already applicable to that Part C State.
749 KANIA C.J. (i) The essentials of a legislative function are the determination of the legislative policy and its formulation as a rule of conduct and these essentials are the characteristics of a legislature by itself.
Those essentials arc preserved when the legislature specifies the basic conclusions of fact upon the ascertainment of which from relevant data by a designated administrative agency it ordains that its statutory command is to be effective.
The legislature having thus made its laws, every detail for working it out and for carrying the enactment into operation and effect may be done by the legislature or may be left to another subordinate agency or to some executive officer.
While this is also sometimes described as delegation of legislative powers, in essence it is different from delega tion of legislative power as this does not involve the delegation of the power to determine the legislative policy and formulation of the same as a rule of conduct.
While the so called delegation which empowers the making of rules and regulations has been recognised as ancillary to legislative power, the Indian Legislature had no power prior to 1935 to delegate legislative power in its true sense.
Apart from the sovereign character of the British Parliament whose powers are absolute and unlimited, a general power in the legislature to delegate legislative powers is not recognised in any state.
The powers of the Indian Legislature under the Constitution Acts of 1935 and 1950 are not different in this respect.
(ii)An ""abdication"" of its powers by a legis lature need not necessarily amount to complete effacement of itself.
It may be partial.
If full powers to do everything that the legislature can do are conferred on a subordinate authority, although the legislature retains the power to control the action of the subordinate authority by recalling such power or repealing the Acts passed by the subordinate authority, there is an abdication or effacement of the legislature conferring such power.
FAzL ALl J. (i) The legislature must formally dis charge its primary legislative function itself and not through others.
(ii) Once it has been established that it has sovereign powers within a certain sphere, it is free to legislate within that sphere in any way which appears to it to be the best way to give effect to its intention and policy in making a particular law and it may.utilise any outside agency to any extent it finds necessary for doing things, which it is unable to do itself or finds it incon venient to (iii) It cannot, however abdicate its legislative functions and therefore, while entrusting power to an out side agency, it must see that such agency acts as a subordi nate authority and does not become a parallel legislature.
(iv) As the courts of India are not committed to the doc trine of separation of powers and the judicial interpreta tion it has received in America, there are only two main checks in this country on the power of the legislature to delegate, these being its good sense and the principle that it should not cross the line beyond which delegation amounts to 750 'abdication and self effacement. ' (v) The power to intro duce necessary restrictions and modifications is incidental to the power to adapt or apply the law.
The modifications contemplated are such as can be made within the framework of the Act and not such as to affect its identity or structure or the essential purpose to be served by it.
PATANJALI SASTRI J. (i) It is now established beyond doubt that the Indian Legislature, when acting within the limits circumscribing its legislative power, has and was intended to have plenary powers of legislation as large and of the same nature as those of the British Parliament itself and no constitutional limitation on the delegation of legislative power to a subordinate unit is to be found in the Indian Councils Act, 1861, Or the Government of India Act, 1935, or the Constitution of 1950.
It is therefore as competent for the Indian Legislature to make a law delegating legislative power, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
as it is for the British Parliament to do so, provided it acts within the circumscribed limits.
(ii) Delegation of legislative au thority is different from the creation of a new legislative power.
III the former, the delegating body does not efface itself but retains its legislative power intact and merely elects to exercise such power through an agency or instru mentality of its choice.
In the latter, there is no delega tion of power to subordinate units but a grant Of power to an independent and co ordinate body to make laws operative of their own force.
For the first, no express provision authorising delegation is required.
In the absence of a constitutional inhibition, delegation of legislative power, however extensive, could be made so long as the delegating body retains its own legislative power intact.
For the second, however, a positive enabling provision in the con stitutional document is required.
(iii) The maxim delegates non potest delegare is not part of the constitutional law of India and has no more force than a political precept to be acted upon by legislatures in the discharge of their func tion of making laws, and the courts cannot strike down an Act of parliament as unconstitutional merely because Parlia ment decides in a particular instance to entrust its legis lative power to another in whom it has confidence or, in other words, to exercise such power through its appointed instrumentality, however repugnant such entrustment may be to the democratic process.
What may be regarded as politi cally undesirable is constitutionally competent.
(iv) Howev er wide a meaning may be attributed to the expression ""restrictions and modifications,"" it would not affect the constitutionality of the delegating statute. 'MAHAJAN J. (i) It is a settled maxim of constitu tional law that a legislative body cannot delegate its power.
Not only the nature of legislative power but the very existence of representative government depends on the doc trine that legislative powers cannot be transferred.
The legislature cannot substitute the 751 judgment, wisdom, and patriotism of any other body, for those to which alone the people have seen fit to confide this sovereign trust.
The view that unless expressly prohib ited a legislature has a general power to delegate its legislative functions to a subordinate authority is not supported by authority or principle.
The correct view is that unless the power to delegate is expressly given by the constitution, a legislature cannot delegate its essential legislative functions.
As the Indian Constitution does not give such power to the legislature, it has no power to delegate essential legislative functions to any other body.
(ii) Abdication by a legislative body need not necessarily amount to complete effacement.
There is an abdication when in respect of a subject in the Legislative List that body says in effect that it will not legislate but would leave it to another to legislate on it.
MUKHERJEA J.
As regards constitutionality of the delegation legislative powers, the Indian Legislature cannot be in the same position as the omnipotent British Parliament and how far delegation is permissible has to be ascertained in India as a matter of construction from the express provisions of the Indian Constitution.
It cannot be said that an unlimit ed right of delegation is inherent in the legislative power itself.
This is not warranted by the provisions of the constitution and the legitimacy of delegation depends en tirely upon its being used as an ancillary measure which the legislature considers to be necessary for the purpose of exercising its legislative powers effectively and complete ly.
The legislature must retain in its own hands the essen tial.
legislative functions which consist in declaring the legislative policy and laying down the standard which is to be enacted into a rule of law and what can be delegeted is the task of subordinate legislation which by its very nature is ancillary to the statute which delegates the power to make it.
Provided the legislative policy is enunciated with sufficient clearness or a standard is laid down, the courts should not interfere with the discretion that undoubtedly rests with the legislature itself in determining the extent of delegation necessary in a particular case.
Das J. (i) The principle of non delegation of legisla tive powers founded either on the doctrine of separation of powers or the theory of agency has no application to the British Parliament or the legislature constituted by an Act of the British Parliament;(ii) in the ever present complex ity of conditions with which governments have to deal, the.power of delegation is necessary for, and ancillary to, the exercise of.
legislative power and is a component part of it; (iii) the operation of the act performed under dele gated power is directly and immediately under and by virtue of the law by which the power was delegated and its efficacy is referable to that antecedent law; (iv) if what the legis lature does is legislation within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power and if it violates no express 752 Condition or restriction by which that power is limited, then it is not for the court to inquire further or enlarge constructively those conditions or restrictions; (v) while the legislature is acting within its prescribed sphere there is, except as herein after stated, no degree of, or limit to, its power of delegation of its legislative power, it being for the legislature to determine how far it should seek the aid of subordinate agencies and how long it shall continue them, and it is not for the court to prescribe any limit to the legislature 's power of delegation; (vi) the power of delegation is however subject to the qualification that the legislature may not abdicate or efface itself, that is, it may not, without preserving its own capacity intact, create and endow with its own capacity a new legislative power not created or authorised by the Act to which it owes its own existence.
(vii) The impugned laws may also be supported as instances of conditional legislation within the meaning of the decision in Queen vs Burah.
Bose J.
The Indian Parliament can legislate along the lines of Queen vs Burgh, that is to say, it can leave to another person or body the introduction or application of laws which are, or may be, in existence at that time in any part of India which is subject to the legislative control of Parliament, whether those laws are enacted by Parliament or by a State Legislature set up by the constitution.
But delegation of this kind cannot proceed beyond that; it cannot extend to the repealing or altering in essential particulars laws which are already in force in the area in question.

68.txt,"Civil Appeal No. 140 of 1951.
Appeal from a Judgment and Decree dated 22nd Septem ber, 1947, of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay (Sen and Bavdekar JJ.) in Appeal No. 41 of 1943 arising out of decree dated 4th September, 1942, of the Court of the First Class Subordinate Judge at Poona in Civil Suit No. 808 of 1941.
Roshan Lal and B.S. Shastri for the appellant.
Hardyal Hardy for the respondent.
February 22.
The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by BOSE J.
This is a defendant 's appeal in a suit on two mortgages.
The first was executed on the 7th of April, 1931, by the defendant and his father.
The second was dated the 17th of December, 1935, and was executed by the defend ant alone.
The first was for a sum of Rs, 9,500, the second for Rs. 3,500.
The same property was mortgaged each time.
The claim on the two deeds together was for Rs. 20,774 3 0.
These mortgages were in favour of one Narayan Gopal Sathe.
On the 28th of March, 1940, the mortgagee assigned them both to the plaintiff who now sues on them.
The defence was that both mortgages were satisfied.
The main evidence on which the defendant relied to prove satisfaction was an agreement dated the 17th of October, 1937, executed by the mortgagee Narayan Gopal Sathe in favour of the defendant.
The document has been excluded from evidence by the trial Court as well as by the High Court on appeal on the ground that it required registration.
If this document is excluded, then there is a concurrent finding of fact by both the Courts that the rest of the evidence is not good enough to prove satisfaction.
They have disbelieved it and decreed the plaintiff 's claim in full.
The only ques tions before us are (1) whether this document required registration and (2) whether, if it did, it 493 cannot still be used for what the defendant claims is a collateral purpose, namely proving full payment of the mortgage amount.
The agreement came about in this fashion.
The mortga gee, Narayan Sathe, was appointed Receiver of two Cinemas in Poona.
The Court appointing him required him to produce a surety in the sum of Rs. 10,000.
The defendant agreed to undertake this responsibility and as a consideration for that the mortgagee executed the agreement in question.
The portions of the document relevant for the present purpose are as follows.
The mortgages are there described as the ""transactions of give and take."" ""(3) It is extremely necessary to explain beforehand the transaction of give and take outstanding between both of us. (4) Whereas two transactions have been done between you and me.
Therefore you have agreed to stand surety.
And only for that reason I am executing this agreement and giving it to you in writing and thereunder I am settling and formulating some new terms and I am confirming some very terms which were declared before.
(5) Although in the matter of the transaction relating to the aforesaid mortgage deeds the rate of interest men tioned in the documents purporting to be the mortgage deeds is 14 annas per mensem per centum, still the actual interest is to be received only at the rate of 8 annas per mensem per centum; so it is settled between you and me and I have also agreed to the same.
And even at that rate I have also been receiving the interest and I shall also receive hereafter. (6) As regards the transaction of the second mortgage deed. if as agreed at that time between you and me you pay me Rs. 1,800 in the lump then it will be understood that the transaction of give and take subsisting between you and me has been wholly completed and fully paid up.
As you have no sufficiency of funds to make up and pay in full the above sum at once it is settled that you are to pay to me Rs. 80 per 64 494 month and thus you are to make payment in full.
In accord ance with the agreement arrived at between us both subse quent to the document purporting to be the second mortgage deed the said documents and papers and the written receipts in respect of interest given to you by me relating to the payment in full made by you in respect of interest and principal on account of the first transaction dated 7 4 31 have been kept with me.
* * (8) As mentioned above (vide paras 5 and 6) no interest of any nature whatever has remained claimable by me from you in accordance with the agreement arrived at between us both from the date of your suretyship onward and prior to it and in like manner I understand that the whole of the principal has been fully paid.
(10) If you so wish or if necessity may arise then at any time you may ask for it and I shall give you this agree ment on being written out on stamped paper and on being registered.
"" In our opinion, this is a document which limits and extinguishes interests in immoveable property in the present within the meaning of section 17(1) (b) of the Indian Regis tration Act.
Clause (4) of the agreement expressly says so.
Referring to the two mortgages it says ""I am settling and formulating some new terms.
"" This speaks from the present.
It does not say that this was some past agreement, and that fact is underlined in the next sentence which reads ""and I am confirming some very terms which were declared before.
"" Among the new terms is the following.
The rate of inter est agreed upon in the two mortgage deeds was 14 annas per cent per month.
Clause (5) reduces this to 8 annas.
It is true that according to clause (5) only 8 annas had actually been paid all along but that hardly 495 matters because the question is not what was paid but what was due and what the mortgagee could have enforced under his bond.
It is evident from clause (4) that it was the agree ment embodied in the document which effected the change and therefore it was the document itself which brought the altered terms into being.
The next question is whether this limits an interest in immoveable property.
We are of opinion it does.
We agree with the learned Rangoon Judges in U. Po Thin vs Official Assignee(1) that one part of the ""interest"" which a mortga gee has in mortgaged property is the right to receive inter est at a certain rate when the document provides for inter est.
If that rate is varied, whether to his advantage or otherwise, then, in our judgment, his ""interest"" in the property is affected.
If the subsequent agreement substi tutes a higher rate, then to the extent of the difference it ""creates"" a fresh ""interest"" which was not there before.
If the rate is lowered, then his original ""interest"" is limited.
The question of a higher rate was considered by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Tika Ram vs Deputy Commis sioner of Bara Banki(2).
There, the mortgagors gave the mortgagees an unregistered rukka or written promise simulta neously with the registered mortgage stipulating that they would pay an extra 6 per cent per annum over and above the 15 per cent entered in the mortgage.
their Lordships held that these rukkas could not be used to fetter the equity of redemption.
They did not decide whether the personal cove nant in the rukkas could be enforced because that point had not been raised in the plaint and pleadings, nor did they refer to the Registration Act, but we think the words ""an unregistered instrument which the statute declares is not to affect the mortgaged property"" can only have reference to that Act.
(1) (1938) R.L.R. 293: A.I.R. 1938 R. 285.
(2) (1899) 26 I.A. 97 at 100.
496 It was argued, on the strength of Mahim Chandra Dey vs Ram Dayal Dutta,(1) Ram Ranjan vs Jayanti lal(2) and Collec tor of Etah vs Kishori Lal(3), that it is always open to a mortgagee to release or remit a part of the debt, and when he does so he does not limit or extinguish an interest in immovable property any more than when he passes a receipt acknowledging payment of the whole or part of the money.
The effect of the payment, or of the release, may be to extin guish the mortgage but in themselves they do not limit the interest.
Extending this, the learned counsel for the defendant contended that when a mortgagee agrees to accept a lower rate of interest he does no more than release that part of the debt which would be covered by the difference in rate.
We do not agree.
There is a difference between a re ceipt and a remission or a release.
A receipt is not the payment, nor does the document in such a case serve to extinguish the mortgage or limit the liability.
It is the payment of the money which does that and the receipt does no more than evidence the fact.
Not so a release.
The extin guishment or diminution of liability is in that event ef fected by the agreement itself and not by something external to it.
If the agreement is oral, it is hit by proviso 4 to section 92 of the Evidence Act, for it ""rescinds"" or ""modi fies"" the contract of mortgage.
If it is in writing, it is hit by section 17 (1) (b) of the Registration Act, for in that case the writing itself ""limits"" or ""extinguishes"" the liability under the mortgage.
It is to be observed that when the mortgagor pays money due on the mortgage, in whole or in part, he is carrying out the terms of the bond and is not making any alteration in it, and even though the fact of payment may limit or extin guish the mortgagee 's interest that is only because the bond is working itself out by the force of its own terms and not by reason of some new agreement which seeks to modify it or limit or extinguish the interest which it creates.
A simple test (1)A.I.R. (3) A.I.R. 1930 All. 721 at 725 F.B. (2) A.I.R. 1926 Cal. 906.
497 is this: see whether the mortgagee can, in the face of the subsequent agreement, enforce the terms of his bond.
If he cannot, then it is plain that the subsequent undertaking has effected a modification, and if that has the effect of limiting or extinguishing the mortgagee 's interest, it is at once hit either by section 17 (1) (b) or section 92 proviso 4.
But when there is a mere payment of money, that is done under the terms of the bond, for the contract of mortgage postulates that the mortgagor should repay the money bor rowed and that when he does so the mortgagee 's interest in the property shall be ""limited"" to the extent of the repay ment or, when all is repaid, be wholly extinguished; nor, of course, does a payment have to be made by a written or registered instrument, or even evidenced by one.
Clause (xi) to section 17 (2) of the Registration Act is based on this principle.
It draws a distinction between a document which, by the force of its terms.
effects the extinguishment, or purports to do so, and one which merely evidences an exter nal fact which brings about that result.
Now apply the test just given to the present case.
Under the mortgages the mortgagee is entitled to interest at 14 annas per cent.
per month but the mortgagor says he cannot claim that.
Why ? Because, according to him, the subsequent agreement altered the terms of the bond and reduced his liability to only 8 annas.
It hardly matters what the agreement is called, whether a release or a remission, nor is it germane to the question that the mortgagee is enti tled to remit or release the whole or a part of the debt; the fact remains that his agreement to do so effects an alteration in the original contract and by the force of its terms or extinguishes his interest, Assume that the mortga gor repaid the whole of the interest at the altered rate and the whole of the principaL, would those repayments by them selves effect an extinguishment of the mortgage ? Clearly not, because unless the subsequent agreement is called in aid, more would be due under the terms of the bond on ac count of the higher rate of interest.
It is evident then that it is the 498 agreement which limits the mortgagee 's interest ' and serves to extinguish the mortgage and not mere payment at the reduced rate.
Similar observations apply to clause (6) of the agree ment.
It begins by reciting a past agreement in which the mortgagor had promised to pay Rs. 1,800 in a lump sum.
We are left to infer that this was to extinguish the mortgage.
If it was, then it would be hit by either section 92, provi so 4, of the Evidence Act or section 17(1)(b) of the Regis tration Act, but that does not matter because the present document varies even that agreement and substitutes a third agreement in its place, namely that payment of Rs. 1,800 by instalments at the rate of Rs 80 a month will effect ""pay ment in full"", that is to say, will extinguish the mortgage.
This speaks from the date of the document, for it says, referring to this agreement, that ' it is settled"" etc.
Next we come to clause (8).
That refers us back to clauses (5) and (6) and says that ""as mentioned there no interest of any nature whatever has remained claimable by me"" and speaking of the principal says ""and in like manner I understand the whole of the prin cipal has been fully paid"".
We have already dealt with clauses (5) and (6).
Clause (8) carries us no further and merely states that because of clauses (5) and (6) neither interest nor principal is now claimable; and of course if neither interest nor principal is claimable that extinguish es the mortgage, and in this case the extinguishment is brought about, not by mere payment in accordance with the terms of the bond, but because of the fresh agreement.
Clause (10) remains for consideration.
It was argued that this brings the matter within section 17(2) (v) of the Registration Act because it gives the defendant the right to obtain another document which will effect the extinguish ment.
We do not agree because clause (v) of sub section (2) of section 17 of the Act postulates that the document shall not of itself create, declare, 499 assign, limit, extinguish any right etc., and that it shall merely create a right to obtain another document etc.
(The stress is on the words ""itself"" and ""merely "". ) We agree with Sir Dinsha Mulla at page 86 of the 5th edition of his Indian Registration Act that ""If the document itself creates an interest in immove able property, the fact that it contemplates the execution of another document will not exempt it from registration under this clause.
"" As we have seen, this document of itself limits or extinguishes certain interests in the mortgaged property),.
The operative words are reasonably clear.
Consequently, the document is not one which merely confers a right to obtain another document.
It confers the right only in certain contingencies, namely, ""if you so wish"" or ""if necessity may arise.
"" Its purport is to effect an immediate alteration in the terms of the two bonds and because of that alteration to effect an immediate extinguishment and limitation.
Clause (10) merely confers an additional right, namely the right to obtain another document ""if you so wish"" or ""if necessity may arise."" Therefore, the document in question is not one which merely creates a right to obtain another.
An agreement to sell, or an agreement to transfer at some future date, is to be distinguished because that sort of document does not of itself purport to effect the trans fer.
It merely embodies a present agreement to execute another document in the future which will, when executed, have that effect.
The document in hand is not of that type.
It does not postpone the effect of extinguishment or limita tion of the mortgages to a future date.
It does not say that the agreement it embodies shall take effect in the future.
It purports to limit and extinguish the liabilities on the two mortgages at once by virtue of the document itself and merely adds that ""if it is necessary or should you want another document, I will repeat the present 500 agreement in a registered agreement.
"" By implication it means that if it is not necessary, or if the mortgagor does not want a registered instrument, the document itself will have effect.
Incidentally, one effect of holding that this document does not limit or extinguish the mortgagor 's li ability would be that there is no agreement to that effect yet in force, This may or may not give the mortgagor a right to obtain specific performance of his right to obtain such an agreement but until he does that there would be no bar to the mortgagee 's claim in this suit.
However, it is not necessary to go as far as that because we are of opinion that this document is not exempt from registration under section 17(2) (v), and we so hold.
The next question is whether the document can be used in evidence under the proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act.
We are clear it cannot.
This is not a suit for specif ic performance nor does any question of part performance under section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act arise.
It remains then to be seen whether the use now sought to be made of the document is to evidence a collateral transaction not required to be evidenced by a registered instrument.
But what is the 'transaction sought to be proved but the very agreement which the document not merely evidences but, by reason of its own force, creates ? That is not a collat eral transaction and even if it were a transaction of that type, it would require a registered instrument for the reasons we have already given.
Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act was re ferred to but it has no application, for the agreement we are concerned with is not a transfer.
There are no words of conveyance in it; also the mortgagor is not continuing in possession in part performance of the contract.
Both mort gages were simple and the right to possession never resided in the mortgagee.
He might in due course have acquired it by process of law if he obtained a decree and purchased at the sale; on the other hand, a stranger might have purchased and the right to possession would 'in that event have passed elsewhere, But he had no right to possession at the 501 date of the agreement and having none he could not have transferred it.
The mortgagor 's possession was consequently not referable to the agreement.
The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
","A suit to recover money based on two mortgages was resist ed by the defendant on the plea that the mortgages were satisfied as the assignor of the mortgages to the plaintiff had executed an agreement in favour of the defendant which proved satisfaction.
This agreement was not registered and the question for determination was whether it required registration and whether if it did, it could not be used for the collateral purpose of proving full payment of the mort gage amount.
The agreement contained, inter alia, the following terms: ""(i) I am settling and formulating new terms and I am confirming some very terms which were de clared before; (iii Although the rate of interest mentioned in the mortgage deeds is 14 annas still the actual rate is to be received at the rate of 8 annas and so it is settled between the original parties; (iii) It was agreed that if you pay me Rs. 1,800 in a lump it will be understood that the transaction has been wholly completed and paid up.
As you have no sufficiency of funds. . . it is settled that you are to pay me Rs. 80 per month; (iv) As mentioned above no interest of any nature whatever has remained claimable by me. . and in like manner I understand whole of the principal has been fully paid; (v) If you so wish or if necessity may arise then at any time you may ask for it I shall give you this agreement written out on stamp paper and on being registered.
"" Held, that the agreement was not exempt from registra tion because the document itself limited and extinguished an ""interest ' ' in immoveable property in the present within the meaning of section 17 (1)(b) of the Indian Registration Act, and it was not exempt under section 17 (2) (v).
Held, also that the document could not be used under the proviso to section 49 of the Registration Act as the suit was not for specific performance and no question of part performance arose in the case and also no question of using the document for a collateral transaction arose because the document was to be used to prove the very agreement which it created itself.

January 30.
Judgment was delivered by BOSE J. PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. and DAS J. agreed with Bose J. Bose J.
The plaintiff appeals.
The suit relates to a Saranjam estate in the State of Bombay.
The plaintiff claims to be the sole Saranjamdar and seeks certain declarations and other reliefs appropriate to such a claim.
The first and second defendants are members of the plaintiff 's family while the third defendant is the State of Bombay (Province of Bombay at the date of the suit).
The only question is whether the suit is barred by section 4 (a) of Bombay Act X of 1876 (Bombay Revenue Juris diction Act).
The following genealogical tree will show the relation ship between the parties: Bhujangrao Appasaheb (British grantee) Daulatrao I (died 24 7 1864) Bhujangrao I Malojirao Yeshwantrao alias (died 1881 ) : Annasaheb : : : (widow) Krishnabai Daulatrao III Bhujangrao II Daulatrao II (Del. 1) (Def. 2) (died 8 5 1931) : Bhujangrao III (Plaintiff) 405 The facts are as follows.
A common ancestor of the present parties was given the Gajendragad estate as a Saran jam some time before the advent of the British.
When they arrived on the scene they decided, as far as possible, to continue such Saranjams, jagirs and inams as had been grant ed by the earlier rulers, and accordingly they framed rules under Schedule B, Rule 10 of Bombay Act XI of 1852 (The Bombay Rent Free Estates Act of 1852) to regulate the mode of recognition and the succession and conditions of tenure to Saranjams, which are analogous to jagirs.
In compliance with this, the common ancestor shown at the head of the genealogical tree set out above was recognised by the Brit ish Government as the Saranjamdar of the Gajendragad estate.
He may for convenience be termed the British Grantee.
The Register exhibit P 53 shows that the estate consisted of 26 villages.
We do not know the date of the British recognition but the nature of the tenure is described as follows : ""Continuable to all male legitimate descendants of the holder at the time of British conquest, viz., Bhujangrao Appasaheb, the first British Grantee, son of Bahirojirao Ghorpade.
"" On the death of the British Grantee (Bhujangrao Appa saheb) he was succeeded by his son Daulatrao I who died on the 24th of July, 1864.
This Daulatrao I left three sons, Bhujangrao I, Yeshwantrao and Malojirao.
In the year 1866 Bhujangrao I and his brother Yesh wantrao alias Annasaheb sued Malojirao for possession of this Saranjam.
A question of impartibility was raised but the Bombay High Court declared that the property in British India was partible.
They further declared that Bhujangrao I was the head of the family and as such was entitled to a special assignment which was not to exceed a quarter share, for the expenses and duties which might devolve on him by virtue of his position, and that after this had been set aside each of the three brothers was entitled to an equal one third Share in the landed property in India.
This judgment 406 is reported in The duties enumerated at page 170 included the ""keeping up of armed retainers for the fort of Gajendragad, and for the improvement of that vil lage, which was the chief seat of this branch of the Ghor pade family, and also to enable him to distribute on ceremo nial occasions the customary presents to the junior members of the family.
"" The judgment is dated the 12th of October, 1868.
As a consequence a division of the property was ef fected.
Malojirao separated himself from his brothers and was allotted seven villages.
The other two brothers continued joint and took the remainder.
But this was only with respect to property situate in British India.
The parties also had property in the State of Kolhapur.
That was left undivided.
Bhujangrao I died in 1881 and his younger brother Yesh wantrao (alias Annasaheb) claimed to succeed as the sole heir.
The Political Department of the Government of India refused to recognise this claim and permitted Bhujangrao I 's widow Krishnabai to adopt a a boy from the family and recog nised him as the heir in respect of that portion of the estate which lay within the Principality of Kolhapur.
This was on the 3rd of February, 1882.
The Bombay Government followed a similar course regarding the property in British India.
On the 26th of April, 1882, they passed a Resolution embodying the follow ing decision: (1) The adoption was to be recognised and the adopted son was to occupy the same position as his adoptive father, that is to say, he was to get one third of the property plus the assignment given to him as head of the family.
(2) Malojirao who had already taken his share of the estate was to continue in possession.
(3) Yeshwantrao (alias Annasaheb) was given the option of remaining joint with the adopted boy or separating.
Finally, the Resolution Concluded 407 ``The two brothers will hold their respective shares as their private property in virtue of the decree of the High Court and the Jahagir will henceforth be restricted to the portion awarded by the High Court to Bhujangrao which the adopted son will now inherit.
It should however be clearly understood that the decision of the High Court is not to be held as a precedent and that no partition of the Jahagir Estate to be continued to the adopted son will ever be allowed.
"" This position was emphasised by Government in the same year on the 22nd August, 1882.
Krishnabai, who had been allowed by Government to adopt Daulatrao II, asked that her husband 's one third share in the estate be also treated as private property in the same way as the shares of the other two brothers.
This prayer was refused and Government stat ed: ""It should be plainly understood that Government allow the adoption to be made by her only in consideration of Bhujangrao 's one third share as well as the portion assigned to him as head of the family being continued to the adopted son as indivisible Jahagir Estate descending in the line of male heirs in the order of primogeniture and subject to no terms whatsoever as to the enjoyment of the same by Krishna bai during her lifetime.
"" The position was re examined by Government in 1891 and its decision was embodied in the following resolution dated the 17th of March, 1891: ""It appears to Government that the whole Gajendragad Estate is a Saranjam continuable as hereditary in the full est sense of the word as interpreted by the Court of Direc tors in paragraph 9 of their Despatch No. 27 dated 12th December, 1855.
It is continuable to all male legitimate descendants of the holder at the time of the British con quest; and should Government ever sanction an adoption the terms of sanction would be those applicable to Saranjamdars.
The property should be dealt with like Other Saranjams in the Political Department.
"" 53 408 In the year 1901 the adopted son Daulatrao II sued Yeshwantrao 's son Bhujangrao II for partition.
It will be remembered that in the litigation of 1866, which ended in the Bombay High Court 's judgment reported in 5 Bom.
H.C.R. 161, Malojirao alone separated and the other two brothers continued joint.
The litigation of 1901 put an end to that position.
High Court 's judgment dated the 12th of March, 1908, makes it clear that as Government was not a party to that litigation its rights against either or both of the parties were not affected.
But as between the parties inter se they were bound by the previous decision and so the adopted son was entitled to partition and separate posses sion of such properties as might fall to his share.
After this decision was given the two partitioned the property between themselves amicably.
In or about the year 1930 a Record of Rights was intro duced in fourteen of the villages in the Gajendragad Jaha gir and a dispute arose again between the three branches of the family.
The District Deputy Collector, after inspecting the records, found that ""the name of the Khatedar Saran jamdar alone has found place in the village Inam register, in the Saranjam list and the land alienation register,"" while in the other village records the various members of the family were entered according to the ""actual wahivat or enjoyment."" After due consideration he thought that the interest of Government and the Saranjamdar would be sufficiently safeguarded by allowing the same position to continue.
He ordered the entries to be made accordingly.
The order also discloses that the matter had been referred to the Legal Remembrancer to the Bombay Government.
In the meanwhile, on the 5th of May, 1898, a set of Rules framed under Schedule B, Rule 10, of the Bombay Rent Free Estates Act of 1852 were drawn up and published in the Bombay Gazette.
These Rules were republished, probably with some modification, in the Gazette of 8th July, 1901.
The portions applicable here were as follows: 409 ""I. Saranjams shall ordinarily be continued in accordance with the decision already passed by Government in each case.
A Saranjam which has been decided to be hereditarily continuable shall ordinarily descend to the eldest male representative, in the order of primogeniture, of the senior branch of the family descended from the first British Gran tee or any of his brothers who were undivided in interest.
But Government reserve to themselves their rights for suffi cient reason to direct the continuance of the Saranjam to any other member of the said family, or as an act of grace, to a person adopted into the same family with the sanction of Government.
V. Every Saranjam shall be held as a life estate.
It shall be formally resumed on the death of the holder and in cases in which it is capable of further continuance it shall be made over to the next holder as a fresh grant from Gov ernment, unencumbered by any debts, or charges, save such as may be specially imposed by Government itself.
No Saranjam shall be capable of sub division.
Every Saranjamdar shall be responsible for making a suitable provision for the maintenance of. ""(certain members of the family enumerated in the Rule).
If an order passed by Government under Rule VII is not carried out, Government may, whatever the reason may be, direct the Saranjam, or a portion of it, to be resumed. .
Provision for the members of the Saranjam dar 's family entitled to maintenance shall then be made by Government out of the revenues of the Saranjam so resumed.
"" After the District Deputy Collector 's orders were passed on the 20th of May, 1930, Daulatrao II died on the 8th of May, 1931, and the matter was again taken up by Government.
This time it passed the following 410 Resolution on the 7th of June, 1932.
The Resolution was headed, ""Resumption and regrant of the Gajendragad Saranjam standing at No. 91 of the Saranjam List.
"" It reads ""Resolution : The Governor in Council is pleased to direct that the Gajendragad Saranjam should be formally resumed and regranted to Bhujangrao Daulatrao Ghorpade eldest son of the deceased Saranjamdar Sardar Daulatrao Bhujangrao Ghorpade and that it should be entered in his sole name in the accounts of the Collector of Dharwar with effect from the date of the death of the last holder.
The Collector should take steps to place the Saranjamdar in possession of the villages of the Saranjam estate which were in possession of the deceased Saranjamdar.
The Governor in Council agrees with the Commis sioner, Southern Division, that the assignments held by the Bhaubands as potgi holders should be continued to them as at present.
"" The Bhujangrao mentioned in the Resolution is the plain tiff who is shown as Bhujangrao III in the genealogical tree.
The defendants were evidently aggrieved by this, for they filed Suit No. 23 of 1934 against the present plaintiff and the Secretary of State/or India in Council praying inter alia ""that the properties in that suit, viz., the villages allotted to their shares, were their independent and private properties and in case they were held to be Saranjam proper ties, they be declared as independent Saranjams, separate and distinct from the one held by the present plaintiff.
"" This suit was withdrawn with liberty to bring a fresh suit on the same cause of action against the present plain tiff but not against the Secretary of State for India in Council.
According to defendants 1 and 2, this was pursuant to an arrangement between the Government and themselves that Government would issue a fresh Resolution in terms of the earlier Resolution dated the 17th of March, 1891.
411 This was done.
On the 25th of February, 1936, Government passed the following Resolution : ""Resolution : After careful consideration the Governor in Council is pleased to confirm the decision in Government Resolution (Political Department) No. 1769 dated the 17th of March, 1891,and to declare that the whole of the Gajendragad Estate shall be continuable as an inalienable and impartible Saranjam on the conditions stated in the said Resolution.
Having regard, however, to the manner in which different portions of the estate have been held by different branches of the family, the Governor in Council, in modification of the orders contained in Government Resolution No. 8969 dated the 7th June, 1932, is pleased to direct that the portions of the said estate held by Sardar Bhujangrao Daulatrao Ghorpade, Daulatrao Malojirao Ghorpade and Bhujangrao Yeshwantrao Ghorpade, respectively, shall henceforth be entered in the Revenue Records as de facto shares in the said estate held by the said persons as representatives, respectively, of three branches of the Ghorpade family.
Each of the said de facto shares shall be continuable hereditarily as such as ii it were a separate Saranjam estate in accordance with the rules made for the continuance of Saranjams by the Governor in Council in exercise of the powers referred to in the rules framed under the Bombay Rent Free Estates Act, 1852, and section 2 (3) of the Bombay Summary Settlement Act (VII of 1863) and such special orders as the Governor in Council may make in regard to the Gajendragad Estate as a whole or in regard to the said share.
The recognition of the aforesaid shares and their entry in the Revenue Records as separate shares shall not be deemed to amount to a recognition of the estate of Gajendragad as in any manner partible or alienable and shall not in any way affect the right of Government to treat the said estate as an entire impartible and inalien able Saranjam estate.
The Governor in Council further directs that the aforesaid shares shall in no case be capable of 412 sub division and shall not in any way be alienated or encum bered except in accordance with the rules and orders re ferred to above. "" The present suit is an attack on the action of Govern ment in passing this Resolution.
The first and second defendants are the present representatives of the other branches of the family and the third defendant is the Prov ince of Bombay (now the State of Bombay).
The plaint states ""9.
Government can have no jurisdiction to deprive the plaintiff at any rate during his lifetime of the full bene fit of all the rights and privileges appertaining to the holder of a Saranjam.
The Order of Government of the 8th February, 1936 is, therefore, ultra vires and in no way binding on the present plaintiff. 10.
Defendants 1 and 2, therefore, are not entitled to any rights or privileges claimable by the holder of a Saran jam which according to the G.R. is continuable 'as an inali enable and impartible Saranjam ', such as for example in the matter of appointment of the village officers in any of the 27 villages appertaining to the Gajendragad Saranjam.
The cause of action arose in April 1938 and the resolution and the entry being ultra vires is not binding. 12.
As this is a suit claiming for relief primarily against defendants 1 and 2, defendant 3 is made a party to the suit in order to enable Government (defendant 3) to give proper effect to the decision of Government of the 17th March, 1891, and of 7th June, 1932, as against defendants 1 and 2 who have no right to the position which they claim. "" The reliefs prayed for are ""(a) That it be declared that defendants 1 and 2 have no right to go behind the order of the Government as per Reso lution No. 8969 of 7th June, 1932, under which plaintiff is entitled to be recognised as the sole Saranjamdar in the Revenue Records, and that the assignments held by defendants 1 and 2 are held by them as mere potgi holders.
413 (b) That in consequence of his position of a sole Saran jamdar the plaintiff alone at any rate during his lifetime has the sole right to the rights and privileges appertaining to the post of a sole Saranjamdar, to wit, to be consulted in the appointment of the village officers in all the villages appertaining to the Saranjam estate, but assigned to defendants 1 and 2 for potgi. (c) Defendants 1 and 2 be restrained from doing any acts or taking any steps in contravention of the aforesaid right of the plaintiff.
(d) That it be declared that defendant 3 (Government) have no right to change the Resolution No. 8969 of 7th June, 1932, and at any rate during the lifetime of the plaintiff.
"" The first Court dismissed the plaintiff 's claim on the merits holding that Government had the right to amend its Resolution in the way it did.
The lower appellate Court also dismissed the suit on three grounds: (1) that the two previous decisions of 1868 and 1908 operate as res judicata, (2) that the impugned Resolution is intra vires and (3) that section 4 (a) and (d) of the Revenue Jurisdiction Act bars the jurisdiction of the Court.
In second appeal the High Court only considered the question of jurisdiction and, agreeing with the lower appel late Court on the point, dismissed the appeal but it granted the plaintiff leave to appeal to this Court.
The only question we have to consider is the one of jurisdiction.
Section 4 of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act, 1876 (Bombay Act X of 1876), runs Subject to the exceptions hereinafter appearing, no Civil Court shall exercise jurisdiction as to (a). claims against the Crown relating to lands. held as Saranjam. "" It was strenuously contended that this is not a claim against the Crown but one against the first and second defendants.
That, in my opinion, is an idle contention in view of paragraphs 9 and 12 of the plaint and reliefs (a)and (d).
In any event, Mr. Somayya was asked whether he would strike out the third defendant 414 and those portions of the plaint which sought relief against it.
He said he was not prepared to do so.
I cannot see how a plaintiff can insist on retaining a person against whom he claims no relief as a party.
I am clear that this is a suit against the ""Crown"" within the meaning of section 4(a).
The next question is whether, assuming that to be the case, it is also one ""relating to lands held as Saranjam.
"" So far as the reliefs sought against Government are concerned, that is clearly the case.
Paragraph 9 of the plaint challenges Government 's jurisdiction to deprive the plaintiff of the full benefit of all rights and privileges appertaining to the holder of a Saranjam.
These rights cannot exist apart from the lands which form part of the Saranjam estate and the implication of the prayer is that Government has, for example, no right to resume the Saranjam either under Rule V on the death of the last Saran jamdar or under Rule IX during his lifetime.
It is to be observed that a resumption under Rule IX can only be of the land because the rule directs that when the Saranjam is resumed Government itself shall make provisions for the maintenance of those entitled to it ""out of the revenues of the Saranjam so resumed.
"" These revenues can only come out of the land.
Relief (d) in the prayer clause seeks a declaration that Government has no right to change Resolution No. 8969 dated the 7th of June, 1932.
That Resolution directly relates to the land because it directs that the Gajendragad Saranjam be resumed and the Collector is directed to take steps to place the Saranjamdar in possession of the villages of the Saran jam estate etc.
It is impossible to contend that this is not a claim relating to lands held as Saranjam.
It was next argued that if that be the case the claim against Government can be dismissed and the plaintiff can at least be given the reliefs claimed against the other two defendants.
These, it was contended, do not relate to land and in any event are not claims against the ""Crown"".
415 In my opinion, this is not a suit in which the rights claimed against the other defendants can be divorced from the claim against Government and considered separately.
That is evident enough from paragraph 10 of the plaint.
In para graph 9 the power of Government to deprive the plaintiff of the rights he claims is challenged and in paragraph 10 the plaintiff explains that ""therefore"" the first and second defendants are not entitled to any of the rights and privileges of the Saranjamdar.
One of those rights, as we have seen from Rules VII and IX, is to take the revenues of the entire estate in order that he might fulfil his obligation regarding the payment of maintenance to certain members of the family; and if the defendants claim to hold their lands under the orders of Government and the plaintiff insists on retaining Government as a party in order that it may be bound by the decree he wants against the other defendants it is obvious that his claim against these defendants cannot be separated from his claim against the Government.
In any event, if the claim against Government is to be ignored it can only be on the basis that its orders cannot be challenged and if the orders stand it is evident that the plaintiff can have no hope of success because both sides hold their respective properties on the basis of those orders.
There are two decisions of the Bombay High Court which have taken this view.
Basalingappagouda vs The Secretary of State for India(1) was a Watan case.
Government had recog nised the second defendant as the Watandar.
Plaintiff sued Government and the second defendant and sought a declaration and injunction.
On being faced with the dilemma that the suit against Government did not lie because of section 4 (a) (3) of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act of 1876, he asked the Court, as here, to leave the Government out of consider ation and decree his claim against the second defendant alone.
The learned Judges held that that would amount to striking out the main relief sought against both the defend ants and would entirely (1) 28 Born.
L.R. 651.
54 416 change the character of the suit and added that ""as long as the Secretary of State is a party to the suit, such a decla ration could not be granted.
"" In the other case, Basangauda vs The Secretary State(1), Beaumont C.J. and Baker J. took the same view.
They said ""Mr. Gumaste, who appears for the appellant, says that his claim is not a claim against the Government but in that case he ought to strike out the Government.
He is not pre pared to strike out the Government, because if he does they will not be bound by these proceedings and will follow the decision of their revenue tribunals.
Therefore, he wants to make the Government a party in order that they may be bound.
But, if they remain a party, it seems to me that there is a claim against them relating to property appertaining to the office of an hereditary officer, although no doubt it is quite true that the appellant does not desire to get any order against the Government as to the way in which the property should be dealt ' with or anything of the sort, and he only wants a declaration as to his title which will bind Government."" They held that the jurisdiction of the courts was oust ed.
It was next contended, on the strength of a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council reported in Province of Bombay vs Horrnusji Manekji(2).
that the courts have jurisdiction to decide whether Government acted in excess of its powers and that that question must be decided first.
In my opinion, this decision does not apply here.
Their Lordships were dealing with a case falling under section 4 (b) of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act of 1876.
That provides that "". no Civil Court shall exercise jurisdiction as to. . (b) objections to the amount or incidence of any assess ment of land revenue authorised by the Provincial Govern ment.
"" (1) (2) 74 I A. 103 417 As pointed out by Strangman K.C., on behalf of the plaintiff respondent, ""authorised"" must mean ""duly autho rised,"" and in that particular case the impugned assessment would not be duly authorised if the Government Resolution of 11 4 1990 purporting to treat the agreement relied on by the respondent as cancelled and authorising the levy of the full assessment was ultra vires under section 211 of the Land Revenue Code.
Thus, before the exclusion of the Civil Court 's jurisdiction under section 4 (b) could come into play, the Court had to determine the issue of ultra vires.
Consequently, their Lordships held that that question was outside the scope of the bar.
But the position here is different.
We are concerned here with section 4 (a) and under that no question about an authorised act of Government arises.
The section is general and bars all ""claims against the Crown relating to lands. held as Saranjam.
"" That is to say, even if the Government 's act in relation to such lands was ultra vires, a claim impugning the validity of such an act would fall within the scope of the exclusion in clause (a) provided it relates to such land.
There is a difference of opinion in the Bombay High Court as to whether section 4 is attracted if the only relief sought against Government is a declaration.
One set of decisions holds that that does not amount to a ""claim against Government.
"" Dattatraya Vishwanath vs The Secretary of State for India(1) is typical of that view.
On the other hand, Daulatrao vs Government of bombay(2), a case relating to the Gajendragad estate, took the other view.
In my opin ion, the latter view is correct.
In my opinion, the decision of the High Court was right and I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

","The position of the Gajendragad estate which had been recognised by the British Government as a saranjam and which had been declared by the Bombay High Court in 1868 to be partible, was re examined in 1891 and Government passed a Resolution in 1891 that ""the whole of the Gajendragad estate was a saranjam continuable as hereditary in the fullest sense of the word.
It is continuable to all male legitimate descendants of the holder at the time of the British con quest."" In 1932 by another Resolution Government formally resumed the grant and re granted it to the plaintiff who belonged to the first branch of the family of the original grantee with a direction that it should be entered in his sole name in the accounts of the Collector.
The other two branches felt aggrieved and in 1936 Government passed anoth er Resolution which confirmed the Resolution of 1891 and modified the Resolution of 1932, by declaring that the portions of the 403 estate held by the branches shall be entered as de facto shares and that each share shall be continuable hereditarily as if it were a separate saranjam estate.
The plaintiff instituted a suit impleading the representatives of the other two branches as defendants 1 and 2, and the Province of Bombay as the 3rd defendant, alleging that the Resolution of 1936 was ultra vires and praying (A) for a declaration (i) that the defendants 1 and 2 had no right to go behind the Resolution of 1932 under which the plaintiff was recog nised as the sole saranjamdar and that the assignments held by defendants were held by them as mere potgi holders, (ii) that the plaintiff had the sole right to all privileges appertaining to the post of saranjamdar, and (iii) that the Government had no right to change the Resolution of 1932, and (B) for restraining the defendants 1 and 2 from doing any acts in contravention of the aforesaid right of the plaintiff.
Held, (i) that the suit was a suit ""against the Crown"" and also a suit ""relating to lands held as saranjam"" within the meaning of sec.
4 of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act, 1876, and the Civil Courts had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit; (ii) that the plaintiff could not be given even the reliefs claimed against defendants 1 and 2 alone, as the rights claimed against these defendants could not be di vorced from the claim against the Government and considered separately; (iii) in any event if the claim against the Government was to be ignored it can only be on the basis that its orders could not be challenged and if the orders stood, the plaintiff could not succeed because both sides held their respective properties on the basis of those orders.

Appeal by special leave from a judgment of the High Court of Punjab (Falshaw and Soni JJ.) dated 30th December, 1949, upholding the conviction of the appellant under sections 302 and 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and confirming the sentence of death passed against him by the Sessions Judge of Ferozepore on the 20th July, 1949, in Criminal Appeal Case No. 325 of 1949.

General of the Punjab, (section M. Sikri, with him) for the respondent.
October 17.
The judgment of the court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J.
This is an appeal by special leave from the judgment of the High Court of Punjab upholding the convic tion of the appellant.
Mohinder Singh, under sections 302 and 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, and confirming the sentence of death passed against him by the Sessions Judge of Ferozepore.
The case for the prosecution which has been substantial ly accepted by the trial Judge and the High Court is briefly as follows.
Sometime in January, 1949, one Bachittar Singh, brother of Dalip Singh who is said, to have been murdered, lodged a complaint before the NaibTehsildar at Zira to the effect that a tree belonging to him had been cut by 7 per sons including Mohinder Singh, the appellant.
On the 28th February, 1949, which was the date fixed for the hearing of the case before the Naib TehsiIdar, Jita Singh and Dalip Singh, the two brothers of Bachittar Singh, were attacked by the appellant and one Gurnam Singh, a lad of 17, near a Gurdwara at about mid day, when 823 they were returning from their field.
Jita Singh was then carrying a load of fodder on his head while Dalip Singh had sickles in his hand.
Jita Singh was the first to be at tacked near a tailor 's shop by Mohinder Singh who fired at him from behind hitting him on the neck whereupon he fell down together with the bundle of fodder.
Dalip Singh, who was following Jita Singh, then ran backwards and he was chased by Gurnam Singh round the outer boundary of a tank which was close by.
Mohinder Singh ran on the other side of the tank in the opposite direction and confronted him and shot him with a gun on the chest whereupon he fell down.
Meanwhile, Gurnam Singh had also reached the spot and he fired with his rifle from a distance of about 4 or 5 feet near about Dalip Singh 's ear while he was lying sideways.
The injuries proved fatal and Dalip Singh died on the spot.
The same day at 3 p.m., Jita Singh went to the police station at Dharamkot, which is at a distance of 3 miles from village Augar, where the occurrence had taken place, and lodged a first information report, charging Mohinder Singh, with having caused injury to him, and Mohinder Singh and Gurnam Singh with the murder of Dalip Singh; and the police after investigating the case sent up a charge sheet against the two accused persons.
Thereafter they were tried by the Sessions Judge of Ferozepore under sections 302 and 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
The appellant was sentenced to death under section 302 and Gurnam Singh was sentenced to transportation for life under that section in view of his youth.
They were also sentenced to 3 years ' rigorous imprisonment each under section 307 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code.
It appears that Dalip Singh had 6 injuries altogether which are described by the doctor who performed the post mortem on his body in these words: "" 1.
An irregularly round gun shot wound on the left temporal region, 1"" diameter.
The wound is 22"" behind outer canthus of left eye, its upper portion is at a level with the top of the pinna of the left ear, 824 behind it commences at the cartilages of the ear which are broken.
Brain is visible in the gap of the wound.
An area 4 "" x 4 "" is blackened, the wound being situated in the middle of this area.
A gun shot wound 3/4"" X 1/2"" on the back of right mastoid region, upper end of the wound is 1"" behind the root of the right ear.
Direction is vertically oblique.
On dissection the left temporal bone under injury No. 1 is, hole and its petrous portion shattered.
A linear fracture extends upwards and backwards, from the hole into the left parietal and occipital bones.
After piercing through the left temporal lobe of the brain the projectile has pierced through the brainstem, and emerged out as injury No. 2, holding the mastoid region of the skull on the right side.
A gun shot wound 3/4"" X 5/8"" on the left side of chest 21/2"" above and behind the left nipple and 1/2"" behind the anterior axillary fold as area 1"" below the wound is bruised.
A gun shot wound 1/2""X 3/4"" on the right side of chest in the mid axillary line.
The top of the wound being 1 3/4"" from the apex of right axilla and 4 3/4"" above and behind the right nipple.
A gun shot wound 1/2""x 1/4"" on the inner aspect of the right arm, upper end of the wound is 11/4"" from the top of the anterior axillary fold.
A gun shot wound 3/4""X 1/2"" on the front of the right arm.
Its upper end being 21/2"" from the top of the anterior axillary fold.
Its distance from injury No. 5 being 1"" and it is inter connected with injury No. 5 under the skin.
"" The doctor has stated in his evidence that in all two projectiles appeared to have hit Dalip Singh, and injuries Nos. 1 and 2 were caused by one of them, injury No. 1 being the wound of entrance and injury No. 2 being the wound of exit, With regard to the other 4 injuries, his evidence is as follows : ""Injury No. 3 is the wound of entrance of another projectile and No. 4 is the wound of its exit.
Wound 825 No. 5 is the wound of its re entrance and wound No. 6 the wound of its final exit from the body."" Jita Singh had 4 slight injuries on the back of the neck which are said to have been caused by pellets and two abra sions below the right elbow and right knee said to have been caused by blunt weapons.
It may be stated here that when the investigating police officer arrived at the scene of occurrence, he found an empty cartridge case at the place where Jita Singh is said to have been fired at, and 2 empty cartridge cases and a blood stained cap of a cartridge case near the place where the dead body of Dalip Singh was lying.
Later, when Mohinder Singh appeared before the police, he was asked whether he possessed a gun and he produced a 12 bore gun (exhibit P 16) for which he held a licence.
The gun and the empty cartridges were thereupon sent to Dr. Goyle, Director of the C.I.D. Laboratory, Phillaur, and the opinion that he submitted may be summed up as follows : The gun had signs of having been fired but he could not say when it was fired last.
The cartridge cases P 10 and P 15 could have been fired through the gun P 16, but he could not say wheth er they were actually fired from that particular gun or a similar gun or guns.
He did not make any experiment by firing any cartridge from the gun P 16, nor did he compare the markings on the empty cartridges P 10 and P 15.
A notable feature of the case is that the occurrence is said to have taken place in the vicinity of a Gurdwara and some houses, but in spite of this fact, not a single person of the locality has been cited or examined as a witness by the prosecution.
The whole case rests on the evidence of 3 witnesses, viz., Jita Singh, Harnam Singh and Buta Singh.
Jita Singh, who had been shot at from behind, claims to have seen the two accused firing at his brother.
Harnam Singh admittedly lives at a considerable distance from the place of occurrence but has stated that he was coming from another village where he had gone to fetch some medicine for his maternal cousin, when he 826 saw the occurrence.
Buta Singh, who is a tonga driver, belongs to a distant village and is somewhat remotely related to Harnam Singh, and accounts for his presence near the scene of occurrence by saying that he had come to see Harnarn Singh the evening before.
Harnam Singh admitted in his evidence that there was a dispute between him and Mohinder Singh nearly a month before the occurrence about a wall, but he also says that the dispute ' had been amicably settled by the panchayat"".
There is nothing before us to show what the award of the panchayat was and whether or not it left any ill feeling behind.
But, on the argu ments of the counsel and the apparently trivial motive for which Dalip Singh is said to have been murdered, it would appear that among the class of persons with which we are concerned petty quarrels give rise to enmity which does not die soon or easily.
After the close of prosecution evidence in the Ses sions Court, the appellant was examined under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and he denied that he had fired at Jita Singh and Dalip Singh with the gun P 16 and that Gurnam Singh had fired at Dalip Singh with a rifle.
He added that he was not present in village Augur at the time of the alleged occurrence but had gone to Zira to attend the Naib Tehsildar 's court.
To establish his plea of alibi, he examined 3 witnesses in the court of the Sessions Judge.
The first witness was the Naib Tehsildar before whom Bachittar Singh had lodged the complaint, and he stated that when the case was called on the 28th February, 1949, 6 or 7 persons appeared in court.
He also proved an application for a taccavi loan which purports to have been filed by the appel lant on the 28th February, 1949, and bears his thumb impres sion.
He further stated in his evidence that he had passed orders on that application on the 28th February but he did not know Mohinder Singh and therefore could not say who had produced that application before him on that date.
The second witness for the appellant was his brother in law, Jogindar Singh, who had written the application.
exhibit D C.
He has stated that 827 Mohinder Singh himself was present in the court of the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, that he had signed the application (exhibit D C) and that he was also one of the persons who had appeared before the Tehsildar when Bachittar Singh 's case was called out.
The third defence witness is a hand writing and fingerprint expert.
He has proved that the application (exhibit D C) alleged to have been presented to the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February bore the thumb impression of the appellant, and he has also given evidence to show that certain handwritings which he was asked to compare did not tally.
The evidence given by him with regard to these handwritings has a bearing on the assertion made by the appellant in a petition filed before the committing Magistrate to the effect that the original service report of the process peon showing that the appellant also was one of the persons served for appearance before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, had been suppressed and another report with forged handwriting had been substituted in its place.
Both the courts below have held that the alibi has not been proved by satisfactory evidence and that the charges against the appellant have been made 'out.
It seems that the learned Judges of the High Court were not at all impressed by the evidence of Dr. Goyle which they characterized as unsatisfactory and they were not also confident that the gun, exhibit P 16, had been used in causing the injuries to Dalip Singh.
This appears from the folio.wing observations made by them in their judgment: ""The gun P 16 was identified by Jita Singh as the gun with which Mohinder Singh fired at him and Dalip Singh but he identified the gun because of a brass plate at its butt end.
We have seen the gun.
Its brass plate could be of no use for the identification of the gun.
"" Again, commenting on the nature of the injuries, the learned Judges observed as follows : 828 ""Another difficulty which is created in this case is the nature of injuries found on the body of Dalip Singh .
What kind of bullet it was which, though it had blackened the area where it entered the brain showing that it had been fired from not far away, did not shatter the brain we do not know.
What kind of projectile it was which entered the body (which if the evidence as to be believed was fired at from a few feet at Dalip Singh) and passed through the body without shattering the inside of the chest or causing extensive damage therein is also not known.
Mr. Sethi (counsel for the accused) quoted Taylor 's book on medical jurisprudence and Hateher 's book on ballistics and argued that the firing must have been from a place between 600 and 1,200 yards away in order that the projectile may pass through and through the body and not shatter it.
That of course pre supposes that the barrel of the gun, using the word 'gun ' m ' a generic sense, is grooved which causes a projectile to go forward with a rotatory motion of something under a quarter of a million revolutions a minute and travelling at the rate of about 2,000 miles an hour when it leaves the gun . .
We do not know whether the barrel of this gun (exhibit P 16) is grooved or not.
is a single bar relled gun and is country made.
The likelihood is that the barrel is not grooved.
"" On a careful reading of the judgment under appeal, it appears that the learned Judges of the High Court strongly felt that they had no adequate explanation in the oral evidence before them for certain puzzling features of the injuries on Dalip Singh.
This is exactly what we also feel in this case, and it seems to us that the evidence which has been adduced falls short of proof in regard to a very mate rial part of the prosecution case.
in a case where death is due to injuries or wounds caused by a lethal weapon, it has always been considered to be the duty of the prosecution to prove by expert evidence that it was likely or at least possible for the injuries to have been caused with the weapon with which and in the manner in which they are al leged to have been caused.
It is 829 elementary that where the prosecution has a definite or positive case, it must prove the whole of that case.
In the present case, it is doubtful whether the injuries which are attributed to the appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle.
Indeed, it seems more likely that they were caused by a rifle than by a gun, and yet the case for the prosecu tion is that the appellant was armed with a gun and, in his examination, it was definitely put to him that he was armed with the gun P 16.
It is only by the evidence of a duly qualified expert that it could have been ascertained whether the injuries attributed to the appellant were caused by a gun or by a rifle and such evidence alone could settle the controversy as to whether they could possibly have been caused by a fire arm being used at such a close range as is suggested in the evidence.
It is clear, and it is also the prosecution case, that only 2 shots were fired at Dalip Singh and one of the crucial points which the prosecution had to prove was that these shots were fired by two persons and not by one man, and both the shots were fired in such manner and from such distance as is alleged by the eye witnesses.
There is, in our opinion, a gap in the prosecu tion evidence on a most fundamental point and the error which has been committed by the courts below is to ignore the gap and decide the case merely upon the oral evidence of 3 witnesses, two of whom are mere chance witnesses and not altogether independent persons, and the evidence of the third witness is open to criticism on the ground of his partisanship as well as the improbability of his having been able to see the firing at his brother after he had himself been shot at the back of the neck.
The learned Judges of the High Court, after commenting upon the entire evidence, say in their judgment: "" We are thus left with the evidence of the three wit nesses of the prosecution together with the state of wounds as shown by the medical evidence and an unsatisfactory statement of Dr. Goyle.
"" 106 830 They reject the evidence of Dr. Goyle and they consider the nature of the wounds to have created a serious dificulty in the case.
Having arrived at these conclusions, it was a serious thing to rest the appellant 's conviction wholly upon the oral testimony in the case which has remained unchecked and unconfirmed by expert evidence.
The real position ap pears to be that the prosecution case cannot be said to be wholly proved but only partly proved if it is permissible to use such an expression.
This Court, as was pointed out in Pritam Singh vs The State (1), will not entertain a criminal appeal except in special and exceptional cases where it is manifest that by a disregard of the forms of legal process or by a violation of the principles of natural justice or otherwise substantial and grave injustice has been done.
It seems to us that the present case comes within the rule laid down, because the appellant has been convicted notwithstand ing the fact that the evidence is wanting on a most.material part of the prosecution case.
This is enough to dispose of this appeal, but we are constrained to say that we are not altogether happy about the manner in which the plea of alibi put forward by the appellant has been disposed of by the courts below.
Ordi narily tiffs court will not look beyond the findings of fact arrived at by the courts below, but we find that in the present case the decision on the plea of alibi has been arrived at in disregard of the principle that the standard of proof which is required in regard to that plea must be the same as the standard which is applied to the prosecution evidence and in both cases it should be a reasonable stand ard.
It is common ground in this appeal that the appellant was summoned to appear before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949, which was the date fixed for dealing with Bachittar Singh 's complaint.
Ordinarily and without looking at anything else, there should have been nothing improbable about his appearance before the Naib Tehsildar on that date, but in the present case there is positive (1) 831 evidence that an application for a taccavi loan bearing that date and also bearing the thumb impression the appellant was put up before the Naib Tehsildar and that was dealt with by him on that very day.
There is also affirmative evidence of a witness to prove that the appellant was present in the Naib Tehsildar 's court.
This witness is undoubtedly closely related to the appellant but his evidence is supported by probability and a written document.
One of the points raised by the prosecution was that the summons for appear ance on the 28th February was not served upon Mohinder Singh, but such evidence as there is on the record bearing on this point has certain peculiar features.
The prosecu tion having cited the Naib Tehsildar and the Ahlmad (Bench Clerk) as witnesses in the case gave them up and stated that the former had been won over by the appellant.
This allega tion could have been substantiated in the cross examina tion of the Naib Tehsildar who was examined as a defence witness, but nothing was elicited from him to support such a charge.
From the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar, it appears that on the 5th July, 1949, the Public Prosecutor showed him exhibit P.S. (which is an order directing the appearance of the seven persons including the appellant mentioned by Bachittar Singh in his complaint, before the Naib Tehsildar on the 28th February, 1949).
and that he told the Public Prosecutor that 6 or 7 persons appeared in his court.
on that date.
After this incident, on the 6th July, 1949, the Public Prosecutor informed the Court that he would ""give up the Naib Tehsildar as he has been won over "".
The evidence of the process peon is of a somewhat suspicious character, because he has conveniently forgotten every material detail.
The appellant asserted at the trial that the original report of the process peon had been suppressed and another report had been fabricated and substituted in its place.
An application to this effect was made by him before the committing Magistrate, and he also examined a handwriting expert to prove some of his allegations.
Neither of the courts below has dealt with the evidence 832 of this expert.
The evidence of the Investigating Officer as recorded by the Sessions Judge is to the following effect : ""P.B. and P.C. were obtained by me from the headquar ters.
Along with P.B. and P.C. the Parvana P.S. was also received by me.
After going through the zimnis, the witness states that the aforesaid documents P.B., P.C. and P.S. were summoned by the committing Magistrate and were not sent for by the witness.
On 16th March, 1949, a Foot Constable was certainly sent to Zira to bring the said file.
But since the file had been sent to the headquarters, therefore, the said constable returned quite blank.
I never inspected this file at the headquarters.
"" The most material document with which we are concerned is P.S. which should have contained an endorsement of serv ice of summons on the persons against whom Bachittar Singh had complained.
It is clear from the first part of the evidence of the Investigating Officer that he had received the report of the process peon which was endorsed on the back of P.S., from the headquarters, but he says later that the papers were sent for but they did not arrive.
It is surprising that when a document was the subject of so much controversy he should have said by mistake that he had received it.
One of the comments made by the learned Ses sions Judge in dealing with the application alleged to have been made by the appellant on the 28th February, 1949, for a taccavi loan is that after producing the application before the Naib Tehsildar on that date, Mohinder Singh could have reached his village by noon time, but on this point the learned Sessions Judge seems to have wholly ignored the evidence of the Naib Tehsildar that he usually dealt with such applications between 12 and 4 P.M. on working days, and also the affirmative evidence of Joginder Singh.
In our opinion, there has been in substance no fair and proper trial in this case, and we are constrained to allow this appeal, set aside the conviction of the appellant under sections 302 and 307 read with section S4 833 of the Indian Penal Code, and direct that he be set at liberty forthwith.
In ordinary circumstances, we might have remanded the case for a flesh trial, but we consider that such a course would, in the present case, be unfair and contrary to settled practice, seeing that the appellant has been in a state of suspense over his sentence of death for more than a year.
Appeal allowed.
","In a case where death is due to injuries or wounds caused by a lethal weapon, it has always been considered to be the duty of the prosecution to prove by expert evidence that it was likely or at least possible for the injuries to have been caused with the weapon with which, and in the manner in which, they are have been caused.
Where in a case of murder, the prosecution case was that the accused shot the deceased with a gun, but it appeared likely that the injuries on the deceased were inflicted by a rifle and there was no evidence of a duly qualified expert to prove that the injuries were caused by a gun, and the nature of the inajuries was also such that the shots must have been fired by more than one person and not by one person only, and the prosection had no evidence to show that another person also shot, and the High Court, though realis ing that there was thus a gap in the prosecution evidence, convicted the accused placing reliance on the oral evidence of 3 witnesses which was not, disinterested: Held, that, the present case fell within the rule laid down in Pritam Singh vs The State ([1959] S C R. 453) inas much as the appellant had been convicted notwithstanding the fact that evidence was wanting on a most material part of the prosecution case, and the conviction could not therefore be upheld, 822 Held also, that the standard of proof which is required in regard to the plea of alibi must be the same as the standard which is applied to the prosecution evidence and in both cases it should be a reasonable standard.

Peti tion under article 32 of the Constitution for a writ in the nature of mandamus.
The material facts are set out in the judgment.
Nuruddin Abroad for the petitioner.
K.N. Aggarwal for the respondents.
February 27.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAs J.
This is an application under article 32 of the Constitution made by Mohammad Yasin for the protection of his fundamental right of carrying on his business which, according to him, is being infringed by the respondent.
The case sought to be made out in the petition may be shortly stated as follows: The petitioner is a wholesale dealer in fresh vegetables and fruits at Jalalabad in the district of Muzaffarnagar in the State of Uttar Pradesh and claims to have been carrying on such business for the last 7 years or so at his shop situated in the town of Jalalabad.
The vegetable and fruit growers used to bring their goods to the town and get them auctioned through any of the vegetable dealers of their choice who used to charge one anna in the rupee as and by way of commission.
The respondent Committee which is a Town Area Committee has framed certain bye laws under which all right and power to levy or collect commission on sale or purchase of vegetables and fruits within the limits of the town vest in the respondent Committee or any other agency appointed by the Committee and no one except the respondent Committee is authorised to deal in wholesale vegetables and fruits and collect the commission thereof in any place and in any event.
The respondent Committee has by auction given the contract for sale of 575 vegetables and fruits and for collecting the commission for the current year to the respondent Bishamber who, it is alleged, has never dealt in vegetables and fruits The respondent Committee has not set up any market nor has it framed any bye laws for issue of licences to the vegetable and fruit merchants.
The bye laws also provide for prosecu tion for the breach of any of the provisions of these bye laws.
Although, in terms, there is no absolute prohibition against carrying on business as wholesale dealer in vegeta bles and fruits, the result of the bye laws requiring the wholesale dealers to pay the prescribed fee of one anna in the rupee to the contractor who holds the monopoly is, in effect, to bring about a total prohibition of the business of the wholesale dealers in vegetables and fruits.
The petitioner contends that by granting a monopoly of the right to do wholesale business in vegetables and fruits to the respondent Bishamber the respondent Committee has in effect totally prevented the petitioner from carrying on his busi ness and has thereby infringed his fundamental right under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
In the alterna tive, the petitioner contends that the respondent Committee has no legal authority to impose a tax of the kind it has sought to do, that the imposition of a tax calculated at one anna in the rupee is in the nature of a sale tax and cannot be regarded as a licence fee and such unauthorised impost constitutes an illegal restraint on his fundamental right under article 19 (1) (g).
The notice of motion has been served on the respondent Committee as well as on respondent Bishamber.
The respond ents have entered appearance and filed an affidavit in opposition to the present application affirmed by their agent on record Paragraph 4 of that affidavit is as follows : ""4.
Paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the petition are wrong and misleading and do not convey the correct idea.
If the bye laws are read from beginning to end, the correct posi tion is that the Town Area Committee has lawfully imposed certain taxes on the purchase 576 and sale of fruits and vegetables within the ambit of the Town Area; and instead of collecting the aforesaid taxes departmentally the Committee finds it more convenient and less expensive to auction the 'right to collect the taxes ' and give the contract to the highest bidder or whomsoever it thinks fit and proper.
There is absolutely no restriction on anybody who wants to purchase or anybody who wants to sell; only he must pay the prescribed tax to the Town Area Commit tee through the Contractor.
The market is open, and writ large throughout the territory of the Town Area Committee and anybody can purchase from anybody and anybody can sell to anybody, without any control or intervention by the Contractor, whose position is simply that of a taxcollector on behalf of the Town Area Committee.
Instead of getting the pay, he gets the profits, if any, and runs the risk of incurring losses if his gross realisations are less than what he paid.
This is clearly the position, and it is submitted, there is nothing wrong with it legally and no interference of the petitioner 's rights.
"" The petitioner has to his petition annexed copies of a set of bye laws dated June 24, 1942, and a copy of a resolu tion of the respondent Committee dated March 16, 1950, recommending the addition of several bye laws to the previ ous bye laws.
At the hearing of the petition before us it was agreed by and between counsel on both sides that the petition has to be disposed of on the basis of the bye laws of 1942 only and learned counsel for the respondent Commit tee has produced the original bye laws of 1942 before us.
Bye law 1 only provides that no person shall sell or pur chase any vegetable or fruit within the prescribed limits of the Town Area Committee, Jalalabad by wholesale or auction,without paying the fee fixed under these bye laws to the licensee appointed by the Town Magistrate.
Bye law 4 (b) expressly provides that any person can sell in wholesale at any place in the Town Area provided he pays the pre scribed fees to the licensee.
It is, therefore, clear that these byelaws do not in terms, prohibit anybody from dealing in vegetables and fruits as alleged by the petitioner 577 and in this respect they materially differ from the bye laws which this Court had to consider in the Kairana case(1) which consequently does not govern this case.
Learned counsel, however, contends and we think with considerable force and cogency that although, in form, there is no prohibition against carrying on any wholesale business by anybody, in effect and in substance the bye laws have brought about a total stoppage of the wholesale deal ers ' business in a commercial sense.
The wholesale dealers, who will have to pay the prescribed fee to the contractor appointed by auction, will necessarily have to charge the growers of vegetables and fruits something over and above the prescribed lee so as to keep a margin of profit for themselves but in such circumstances no grower of vegetables and fruits will have his produce sold to or auctioned by the wholesale dealers at a higher rate of commission but all of them will flock to the contractor who will only charge them the prescribed commission.
On the other hand, if the wholesale dealers charge the growers of vegetables and fruits only the commission prescribed by the bye laws they will have to make over the whole of it to the contractor without keeping any profit themselves.
In other words, the wholesale dealers will be converted into mere tax col lectors for the contractor or the respondent Committee without any remuneration from either of them In effect, therefore, the bye laws, it is said, have brought about a total prohibition of the business of the wholesale dealers in a commercial sense and from a practical point of view.
We are not of opinion that this contention is unsound or untenable.
Learned counsel for the petitioner, however, does not leave the matter there.
He goes further and urges that the respondent Committee has no legal authority to impose this fee of one anna in the rupee on the value of goods sold or auctioned and that such imposition is in the nature of a sale tax rather than a licence fee.
(1) ; 578 Learned counsel for the respondent in reply takes a preliminary objection to this line of argument.
He points out that as the levying of a tax without authority of law is specifically prohibited under article 265 of the Constitu tion, article 81(1) must be construed as referring to depri vation of property otherwise than by levying of a tax and that levying of a tax in contravention of article 265 does not amount to a breach of a fundamental right.
He contends, on the authority of the decision of this Court in Ramjilal vs Income tax Officer, Mohindargarh(1), that while an ille gal imposition of tax may be challenged in a properly con stituted suit, it cannot be questioned by an application under article 32.
This argument overlooks the difference between a tax like the income tax and a licence fee for carrying on a business.
A licence fee on a business not only takes away the property of the licensee but also operates as a restriction on his right to carry on his business, for without payment of such fee the business cannot be carried on at all.
This aspect of the matter was not raised or considered in the case relied on by the learned counsel, and that case, therefore, has no application to the facts of this case.
Under article 19(1) (g) the citizen has the right to carry on any occupation, trade or business which right under that clause is apparently to be unfettered.
The only restriction to this unfettered right is the authority of the State to make a law relating to the carrying on of such occupation, trade or business as mentioned in clause (6) of that article as amended by the Constitution (First Amend ment) Act, 1951.
If therefore, the licence fee cannot be justified on the basis of any valid law no question of its reasonableness can arise, for an illegal impost must at all times be an unreasonable restriction and will necessarily infringe the right of the citizen to carry on his occupa tion, trade or business under article 19 (1) (g) and such infringement can properly be made the subject matter of a challenge under article 32 of the Constitution.
(1) [1951] S.C.R.127.
579 Learned counsel for the respondents then refers us to the U.P. Town Areas Act (No. 11 of 1914) which governs the respondent Committee.
Section 14 of this Act requires the Committee to annually determine and report to the District Magistrate the amount required to be raised in any town area for the purposes of this Act and provides that the amount so determined shall be raised by the imposition of a tax to be assessed on the occupiers of houses or lands within the limits of the town area according either to their general circumstances or to the annual rental value of the houses or lands so occupied by them as the Committee may determine.
There were, at the time when the bye laws of the respond ent Committee were framed, five provisos to this section none of which authorised the imposition of any tax on any business and, therefore, they have no bearing on the ques tion now under consideration.
Learned counsel for the respondents, however, draws our attention to section 38 of the Act which authorises the Provincial Government by noti fication in the Official Gazette to extend to all or any or any part of any town area any enactment for the time being in force in any municipality in the United Provinces and to declare its extension to be subject to such restrictions and modifications, if any, as it thinks fit.
Then he proceeds to draw our attention to Notification No. 397/XI 871 E, dated the 6th February, 1929, whereby, in supersession of all previous notifications, the Provincial Government, in exer cise of the powers conferred by section 38(1) of the United Provinces Town Areas Act, 1914, extended the provisions of sections 293(1) and 298(2) (J) (d) of the United Provinces Municipalities Act (11 of 1916) to all the town area in the United Provinces in the modified form set forth therein.
The original bye laws produced by learned counsel purport, however, to have been framed by the respondent Committee under sections 298 (2)(F)(a)and 294 of the United Provinces Municipalities Act (11 of 1916).
We have not been referred to any notification whereby section '294 580 of the United Provinces Municipalities Act was extended to the respondent Committee.
It appears, however, that the bye laws of the respondent Committee were revised in Septem ber 1942 and were then said to have been made under section 298 (2) (J) (d).
It will have, therefore, to be seen wheth er these bye laws come within The purview of section 298 (2) (J) (d) as modified in their application to the respondent Committee.
It will be noticed that under section 298 (2) (J) (d) as modified as aforesaid the respondent Committee is authorised only to make bye laws fixing any charges or fees or any scale of charges or fees to be paid under section 9.93(1) and prescribing the times at which such charges or fees shall be payable and designating the persons authorised to receive payment thereof.
Section 293(1), as modified, authorises the respondent Committee to charge fees to be fixed by bye laws or by public auction or by agreement for the use or occupation (otherwise than under a lease) of any immovable property vested in, or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee, including any public street or place of which it allows the use or occupation whether by allowing a projection thereon or otherwise.
Bye law 1 of the respondent Committee to which a reference has already been made forbids a person from using any land within the limits of the town area for the sale or purchase of fruits and vegetables without paying the prescribed fee.
Bye law 4 (b), however, allows any person to sell in wholesale at any place in the town area, provided he pays the prescribed fees to the licensee.
These bye laws do not purport to fix a fee for the use or occupation of any immovable property vested in or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee including any public street or place of which it allows the use or occupation whether by allowing a projection thereon or otherwise.
Sections 293(1) and 298(2) (J) (d) of the United Province Municipalities Act, 1916, as amended at the time they were extended to the town areas in the United Provinces do not empower the Town Area Committee to make any bye law authorising it to 581 charge any fees otherwise than for the use or occupation of any property vested in or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee including any public street.
Therefore, the bye laws prima facie go much beyond the powers con ferred on the respondent Committee by the sections men tioned above and the petitioner complains against the en forcement of these bye laws against him as he carries on business in his own shop and not in or on any immoveable property vested in the Town Area Committee or entrusted to their management.
Learned counsel for the respondent Commit tee, however, urges that the growers of vegetables and fruits come on foot or in carts or on horses along the public street and stand outside the petitioner 's shop and for such use of the public street the respondent Committee is well within its powers to charge the fees.
From the way the case was formulated by the learned counsel, it is quite clear that if anybody uses the public street it is the growers of vegetables and fruits who come to the petition er 's shop to get their produce auctioned by the petitioner and the petitioner cannot be charged with fees for use of the public street by those persons.
In our opinion, the bye laws which impose a charge on the wholesale dealer in the shape of the prescribed fee, irrespective of any use or occupation by him of immoveable property vested in or en trusted to the management of the Town Area Committee includ ing any public street, are obviously ultra vires the powers of the respondent Committee and, therefore, the bye laws cannot be said to constitute a valid law which alone may, under article 19(16) of the Constitution,ofimpose a restric tion on the right conferred by article 19(1) (g).
In the absence of any valid law authorising it, such illegal impo sition must undoubtedly operate as an illegal restraint and must infringe the unfettered right of the wholesale dealer to carry on his occupation, trade or business which is guaranteed to him by article 19(1) (g) of our Constitution 75 582 In this view of the matter the petitioner is entitled to a suitable order for protection of his fundamental right.
The prayer in the petition, however, has been expressed in language much too wide and cannot be granted in that form.
The proper order would be to direct the respondent Committee not to prohibit the petitioner from carrying on the busi ness of a wholesale dealer in vegetables and fruits within the limits of the Jalalabad Town Area Committee until proper and valid bye laws are framed and thereafter except in accordance with a licence to be obtained by the petitioner under the bye laws to be so framed.
The respondent Commit tee will pay the costs of this application to the petition er.
Agent for the petitioner: Naunit Lal.
","There is a difference between a tax like the income tax and a licence fee for carrying on an occupation, trade or business.
A licence lee on a business not only takes away the property of the licensee but also operates as a restric tion on his fundamental 573 right to carry on his business.
Therefore if the imposition of a licence fee is without authority of law it can be challenged by way of an application under article 32.
Under article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution a citizen has the right to carry on any occupation, trade or business and the only restriction on this unfettered right is the author ity of the State to make a law relating to the carrying on of such occupation, trade or business as mentioned in cl.
(6) of that article as amended by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951.
If therefore a licence fee imposed for carrying on an occupation, trade or business cannot be justified on the basis of any valid law, no question of its reasonableness can arise, for an illegal impost must at all times be an unreasonable restriction and will necessarily infringe the right of the citizen to carry on his occupa tion, trade or business under article 19(1) (g), and such infringement can properly be made the subject matter of a challenge under article 32 of the Constitution.
Bye law No. 1 of the Bye laws of the Town Area Committee of Jalalabad (in the United Provinces) provided that no person shall sell or purchase any vegetables or fruit within the prescribed limits of the Town Area Committee by whole sale or auction, without paying the fees fixed by these bye laws to the licensee appointed by the Town Magistrate.
Bye law No. 4 (b) provided that any person can sell in wholesale at any place in the town area provided he pays the prescribed fees to the licensee.
A person who had been carrying on the business of wholesale dealer in vegetables and fruits in his own shop at Jalalabad for a period of seven years applied for protection under article 32 contending that these bye laws infringed his fundamental right to carry on his trade guaranteed by article 19 (1) (g) and were there fore void.
Held, that section 293 (1) and section 298 (2) (J) (d) of the U.P. Municipalities Act, 1916, as amended at the time they were extended to the town areas in the United Provinces did not empower the Town Area Committee to make any bye law autho rising it to charge any fees otherwise than for the use and occupation of any property vested in or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee including any public street.
The bye laws in question which imposed a charge on the wholesale dealer in the shape of the prescribed fee, irrespective of any use or occupation by him of immovable property vested in or entrusted to the management of the Town Area Committee including any public street, are obvi ously ultra vires the powers of the Committee and, there fore, the bye laws cannot be said to constitute a valid law which alone may, under article 19 (6) of the Constitution, impose a restriction on the right conferred by article 19(1) (g).
In the absence of any valid law authorising it, such illegal imposition must undoubtedly operate as an illegal restraint and must infringe the unfettered right of the wholesale dealer to carry on 74 574 his occupation, trade or business which is guaranteed to him by article 19 (1) (g) of our Constitution.

71.txt,"Appeal No. 159 of 1951.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated 13th of April, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature at Madras (Rajamannar C.J. and Somasundaram J.) in C.M.P. No. 122/15 of 1950.
M.C. Setalvad (C. R. Pattabhi Raman, with him) for the appellant.
C.K. Daphtary (M. Natesan, with him) for the respondent No.1 V.K.T. Chari, Advocate General of Madras (R. Ganapathi lyer, with him) for respondent No. 4. 1952.
March 17.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
This appeal arises as the result of special leave to appeal granted by this Court on the 1st of May, 1951, against an order of the Madras High Court dated 13th April, 1951, quashing certain proceedings of the Regional Transport Authority, Tanjore, and the Cen tral Traffic Board, Madras, dated 19th January, 1950, and 3rd March, 585 1950, respectively, and an order of the first respondent (the State of Madras) dated 7th November, 1950, and direct ing the issue to Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., (Petitioners before the High Court) of permits for the five buses in respect of which a joint application had been made original ly by them and one T.D. Balasubramania Pillai.
The present appellant, G. Veerappa Pillai, was the fourth respondent in the High Court.
The present first respondents (Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd.) were the peti tioners before the High Court Present respondents Nos. 2, 3 and 4 were respectively respondents Nos. 1, 2 and 3 before the High Court.
The dispute is between the appellant and Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., who were competing bus proprietors in the Tanjore District; and it is over the issues of five perma nent permits for buses Nos.
M.D.O. 81, M.D.O. 230, M.D.O. 6, M.D.O. 7 and M. D.O. 759 on the route between Kumbakonam and Karaikal.
It has been a long drawn game with many moves, counter moves, advances and checkmates, both sides display ing unusual assiduity and skill in their manoeuvres for position.
But it is unnecessary to set out in great detail all the steps taken, as they have been narrated in the order of High Court and many of them are of insignificant rele vance for disposal of this appeal.
I shall state here only what is material.
The 'C ' permits for the five buses stood originally in the name of Balasubramania Pillai.
The buses were agreed to be purchased from him by Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., and there was a joint application by the transferor and trans feree on 10th March, 1944, for transfer of the ownership and of the 'C ' permits in the name of the purchasers.
Two days later, Veerappa Pillai, proprietor of the Sri Sathi Viias Bus Service, who is the appellant before us, applied for temporary permits to ply two of his own vehicles over the same route, stating that the vehicles of the two agencies which held the permits were mostly out of action.
It was a fact that out of the five buses sold 586 by Balasubramania Pillai, only two were then running; the other three were under repairs.
The permanent permits for the sold buses were suspended by order of the Secretary dated 28th March, 1944.
Temporary permits for buses M.D.O. 920, 894, 918, M.S.C. 7632 and 7482 had been issued to Veerappa Pillai during the same month.
Now we come to another chapter in the story.
Balasubra mania Pillai resiled from the joint application and repudi ated it as having been got from him by fraud.
The Secre tary, Road Traffic Board, thereupon refused to transfer the ownership on the 19th March, 1944, and this order was con firmed by the Board on 29th May, 1944, Balasubramania Pillai and Veerappa Pillai made a joint application on 10th April, 1944, for transfer of the buses and the original permits in favour of Veerappa Pillai who had on the same date agreed to purchase the vehicles.
The Secretary granted this applica tion on the same date Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., took the matter before the Central Road Traffic Board and they made an order on 16th August, 1944, upholding the issue of tempo rary permits to Veerappa Pillai for his buses M.D.O. 920, 894,918, M.S.C. 7632 and 7482, but setting aside the trans fer of registry of the original buses and the transfer of the permits relating to the same.
On an application by Veerappa Pillai to review its order dated 16th August, 1944, the Central Road Traffic Board allowed on 27th November, 1944, only the transfer of the ownership of the buses but not a transfer of the permits.
Yet another move in the game was this Veerappa Pillai filed a suit in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Kumbako nam, on 3rd October, 1944, for recovery of possession of the original five buses from Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., on the strength of his purchase from Balasubramania Pillai.
The Subordinate Judge appointed Veerappa Pillai as Receiver on 17th March, 1945, and the five disputed buses were deliv ered to him on 26th April, 1945.
Two of the buses M.D.O. 6 and 7 were repaired by him and put on the route under his temporary permits.
The suit was decreed in 587 his favour on 2nd May, 1946.
Later, he repaired the other three buses M.D.O. 759, 230 and 81 and began to run them on the same route under the temporary permits he held.
Veerappa Pillai was discharged from receivership on 18th September, 1946.
On the strength of the Sub Court decree, Veerappa Pillai again applied for a permanent transfer of the permits, and on 22nd July, 1946, the Central Road Traffic Board trans ferred the petition to the Regional Transport Authority with an intimation that it saw no objection to the issue of regular permits to Veerappa Pillai for the disputed buses or to their transfer in his name, provided there were valid permits in existence.
This view appears to have been modi fied later and on 2nd September, 1946, the Regional Trans port Officer directed the issue of temporary permits to the buses for the period from 3rd September, 1946, to 31st October, 1946, subject to the condition that the issue of the permits did not affect the rights of either party in the matter under dispute.
Thereupon, the Government was moved by Veerappa Pillai and also by Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., but the Government declined to interfere and the result was an order on 30th June, 1947, by the Regional Transport Authority to the following effect: "" Since the subject matter is on appeal before the High Court, the matter will lie over pending the decision of the High Court.
The temporary permits are continued as is being done."" A fresh petition by Veerappa Pillai to the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, was unsuccessful, but a further appeal to the Government of Madras ended in his favour in an order dated 29th March, 1949.
The order is in these terms : ""Shri Sathi Viias Bus Service, Porayar, Tanjore dis trict, have been permitted by the Regional Transport Author ity, Tanjore, to run their buses M.D.O. 6, 7, 81, 230 and 750 on the Kumbakonam Karaikal route on temporary permits from 1944 pending 588 the High Court 's decision on the question of permanent ownership of the buses.
Government consider it undesirable to keep these buses running on temporary permits for a long and indefinite period.
Further Sri Sathi Vilas Bus Service have secured the decision of the Sub Court, Kumbako nam, in their favour about the permanent ownership of the buses.
In the circumstances the Regional Transport Authori ty, Tanjore, is directed to grant permanent permits for the buses of Sri Sathi Vilas Bus Service, Porayar, referred to above in lieu of the existing temporary permits.
"" On the basis of this Government order, permanent permits were issued in favour of Veerappa Pillai on 18th April, 1949.
Getting to know of this last order, Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd.,approached the Government Madras with a petition praying for clarification of the order by making it expressly subject to the decision of the High Court regarding the title to the said five buses and that in the event of the High Court deciding the appeal in favour of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd. ""the above said five permanent permits will be taken away from Veerappa Pillai and given to them."" The Minister of Transport, who dealt with the matter, stated on the petition ""that was my inten tion also.
"" The High Court reversed the decree of the Sub Court on 2nd September, 1949, and came to the conclusion that the title of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., to the five buses prevailed over that of Veerappa Pillai.
On 19th September, 1949, they applied to the Government for cancellation of the five permits issued to Veerappa Pillai and for grant of the same to them.
The Government declined to interfere as the Regional Transport Authority was the competent authority, vide order dated 16th November, 1949.
In their application to the Regional 'Fransport Authority dated 28th November, 1949, Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., asked for withdrawal of the permits.
In the meantime, that is on 14th October, 1949, Veerappa Pillai applied for renewal of his permanent permits held for his own 589 buses Nos.
M.D.O. 1357, 20, 1366, 1110, 1077, M.D.O. 1368 and M.S.C.7632, which had been substituted for the disputed buses as they had become unroadworthy and useless.
The application for renewal has under section 58, sub clause (2), of the Act to be treated as a fresh application for new permits.
This procedure was followed and on 22nd October, 1949, a notification was issued inviting objections against the renewal and giving 30th November, 1949, as the date of hearing.
No objections were received and the Secretary renewed the permits for two years from 1st January, 1950.
This order was dated 3rd January, 1950.
The Regional Trans port Authority dealing with the application of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., dated 28th November, 1949, resolved on 19th January, 1950, that the permanent permits issued to Veerap pa Pillai should be cancelled, that the route should be declared vacant in respect of the five buses and fresh applications should be invited and dealt with on the merits.
The order further stated that ""in the meanwhile Sri G. Veerappa Pillai and Raman and Raman will be given temporary permits for running two and three buses respectively on the route.
The permanent permits will be cancelled with imme diate effect.
Raman and Raman should put in the buses as quickly as possible.
Till then Sri Veerappa Pillai will be given temporary permits so as not to dislocate public traf fic.
"" Both the parties were dissatisfied with this order and preferred appeals to the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, which dismissed the appeal of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., and restored the permanent permits of Veerappa Pillai by order dated the 3rd March, 1950.
Messrs Raman and Raman Ltd., moved the Government, but it declined to interfere by G.O., dated 7th November, 1950.
Thereupon, Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., moved the High Court on 4th December, 1950, under article 226 of the Constitution in Civil Miscellaneous Petition No. 12215 of 1950 for a writ of certiorari for quashing the orders and the proceedings of the 590 Regional Transport Authority, the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, and the State of Madras dated 19th January, 1950, 3rd March, 1950, and 7th November, 1950, respectively, and for the issue of a writ of mandamus or other such appro priate directions to the first respondent to transfer, issue or grant ""the five pucca permits in respect of the route Kumbakonam to Karaikkal to the petitioner herein"" (Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd.) It is on this petition that 'the order challenged in this appeal was made by the High Court.
The High Court took the view that throughout all the stages prior to the High Court 's decree, the parties, the transport authorities vested with the power to issue per mits, and the Government also proceeded upon the footing that the transfer of the permits was dependent on the title to the buses and that Veerappa Pillai obtained the temporary and permanent permits only in his capacity as transferee and not in his individual right.
To quote the learned Chief Justice:""the conduct of the parties, the attitude of the transport authorities including the Government are all explicable only on the assumption that the rights of parties were consequent on the ownership of the five vehicles in question.
The fourth respondent having obtained the benefit of temporary and permanent permits as a transferee from Balasubramania Pillai all this time cannot be heard now to say after the decision of this Court which has negatived his claim and upheld the claim of the applicant that the appli cant should not enjoy the fruits of his success.
"" He further points out that the procedure laid down by the Motor Vehi cles Act and the rules for grant of fresh permits was not followed and that long before the application for renewal was allowed, the Regional Transport Authority had been informed of the decision of the High Court.
The order of the Central Road Traffic Board was in his opinion most unsatis factory, as it was based on a quibbling distinction between ""withdrawal"" and ""cancellation"" of the permits.
In his view, the orders complained against deprived Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., of the fruits of the 591 decree obtained by them at the hands of the High Court after much expenditure of time and money.
An examination of the relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act does not support the view that the issue of a permit for a bus which falls within the definition of a ""stage carriage "" is necessarily dependent on the ownership of vehicle.
All that is required for obtaining a permit is possession of the bus.
As ownership is not a condition precedent for the grant of permits and as a person can get a permit provided he is in possession of a vehicle which satisfies the requirements of the statute or the rules framed thereunder, we have to hold that the parties and the authorities were labouring under a misconception if they entertained a contrary view.
But the assumption on which they proceeded may perhaps be explained, if not justified, on the ground that it was supposed that the question of ownership of the vehicles had an important or material bearing on the question as to which of them had a preferen tialclaim for the permits.
It may well be it Was one of the factors to be taken into account and it seems to us that this was apparently the reason why the question of issue of permanent permits was postponed from time to time till we come to the order of the Government dated 29th March, on petitions presented by both the contestants.
If matters had stood as they were till the Government had made this order, something could have been said in favour of Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., in the event of their ultimate success in the High Court as regards the title to the five buses.
But the said order altered the situation.
In the order, the direction for the grant of permanent permits is not rested solely on the decision of the Sub Court in favour of Veerappa Pillai but another reason was also given, namely, that Government considered it undesirable to keep the buses running on temporary permits for a long and indefinite period.
In giving this reason, they were stating a policy.
77 592 As observed already, the High Court by their judg ment dated 2nd September, 1949, reversed the decree of the Subordinate Judge and dismissed Veerappa Pillai 's suit for possession of the buses based on his title.
If it were the law that the question of possession based on ownership was decisive as regards the grant of permits, and if no other circumstances were available to be taken into account when the question of the issue of permanent permits again came up for consideration, it would have been easy to hold that Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., had at least a preferential claim.
But unfortunately for them, both these requisites are not satisfied.
It has been point ed out already that nowhere do we find in the Act anything to indicate that the issue of permits depends on ownership.
Other circumstances which had a material bear ing as to which of them was entitled to the permits had come into existence since the date of the original joint application and were taken into account by the transport authorities and by the Government.
The order of 19th January, 1950, of the Regional Transport Authority sought to render rough and ready justice between the par ties by the adoption of what may be called a middle course.
The terms of the order have already been set out.
Before disposing of the appeals of both the parties, the Central Traffic Board appears to have called for a report from the Regional Transport Officer.
In this report, attention was drawn to the fact that all the five buses had been replaced by new vehicles and that the registration certificates had been cancelled as a result of the replacement.
After Balasubramania Pillai, it was Veerappa Pillai who was running the buses continuously on this route for nearly 5 years and he also obtained the privilege of securing the permanent permits.
The Central Traffic Board 's order of 3rd March, 1950, restoring the permanent permits of Veerappa Pillai was based on the fact that Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd. asked for withdrawal of the permits and not their cancellation and that no opportunity had been given to Veerappa Pillai to show cause why his permits should not be cancelled; and 593 the procedure prescribed for cancellation was not followed.
When the Government was moved by Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd., under section 64 (a) of the Motor Vehicles Act, they had before them a petition for withdrawal of the perma nent permits issued to Veerappa Pillai and for transfer or grant of five 'pucca permits ' relating to the five buses.
The Government granted stay of the appellate order of the Central Road Traffic Board pending disposal of the revision petition 'and called for a report from the subordinate trans port authorities.
Two important facts were brought to the notice of the Government in the report Messrs. Raman and Raman Ltd. did not file any objections to the renewal of the permits sought by Veerappa Pillai.
What is more important, they had no permits from the French authorities enabling them to run any buses on the portion of the route which lay in French territory.
It was further pointed out that there was no subsisting joint application to support the request for transfer and that the original permits in the name of Bala. subramanian had ceased to exist after 31st December 1944.
The Government had also before them two petitions dated 8th March, 1950, and 25th October, 1950, from Messrs Raman and Raman Ltd. and two petitions dated 29th March, 1950, and 8th June, 1950, from Veerappa Pillai.
It is on the basis of all these materials that the Government de clined to interfere with the decision of the Central Road Traffic Board.
It is contended for the appellant that in this state of affairs the High Court acting under Article 226 of the Constitution had no right to interfere with the orders of the transport authorities.
It is unnecessary for the disposal of this appeal to consider and decide on the exact scope and extent of the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 226.
Whether the writs it can issue must be analogous to the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari specified therein and the power is subject to all the limitations, or restrictions 594 imposed on the exercise of this jurisdiction, or whether the High Court is at liberty to issue any ""suitable directions or orders or writs untramelled ,by any condi tions, whenever the interests of justice so require, is a large and somewhat difficult problem which does not arise for solution now.
Mr. Setalvad appearing for the appellant urged two narrower grounds as sufficient for his purposes.
Firstly, he urged that however wide the jurisdiction of the High Court might be under Article 226, it could never exer cise its powers under the article in such a manner as to convert itself into a court of appeal sitting in judgment over every tribunal or authority in the State discharging administrative or quasi judicial functions.
Secondly, he maintained that the Motor Vehicles Act with the rules framed thereunder dealing with the grant of permits is a self contained code and that in respect of the rights and liabil ities created by such a statute the manner of enforcement must be sought within the statute itself.
It was further urged by him that in any event, the High Court could not substitute its own view or discretion for the view taken or discretion exercised by the specified authorities, even if it was erroneous or unsound.
Such writs as are referred to in Article 226 are obvi ously intended to enable the High Court to issue them in grave cases where the subordinate tribunals or bodies or officers act wholly without jurisdiction, or in excess of it, or in violation of the principles of natural justice, or refuse to exercise a jurisdiction vested in them, or there is an error apparent on the face of the record, and such act, omission, error, or excess has resulted in manifest injustice.
However extensive the jurisdiction may be, it seems to us that it is not so wide or large as to enable the High Court to convert itself into a Court of appeal and examine for itself the correctness of the decision impugned and decide what is the proper view to be taken or the order to be made Mr. Daphtary, who appeared for the respondent, said nothing to controvert this position.
His argument 595 was that if all along the authorities and the Government had proceeded upon a particular footing and dealt with the rights of the parties on that basis, it was not open to them afterwards to change front and give the go by altogether to the conception of the rights of parties entertained by them till then.
According to him, there was manifest injustice to his client in allowing them to do so and this was the reason which impelled the High Court to make the order which is the subject matter of challenge in this appeal.
The Motor Vehicles Act is a statute which creates new rights and liabilities and prescribes an elaborate procedure for their regulation.
No one is entitled to a permit as of right even if he satisfies all the prescribed conditions.
The grant of a permit is entirely within the discretion of the transport authorities and naturally depends on several circumstances which have to be taken into account.
The Regional Transport Authority and the Provincial Transport Authority are entrusted under section 42 with this power.
They may be described as administrative bodies exercising quasijudicial functions in the matter of the grant of per mits.
Under rule 8 of the Madras Motor Vehicles Rules the Regional Transport Authority is called the Road Traffic Board and the Provincial Transport Authority is called the Central Road Traffic Board.
These bodies or authorities are constituted by the Provincial ' Government.
The matters which are to be taken into account in granting or refusing a stage carriage permit are specified in section 47.
By delegation under rule 134 A, the Secretary of the Road Traf fic Board may exercise certain powers as regards the grant or refusal of stage carriage permits and under rule 136 there is an appeal to the Board from these orders.
Similar powers of delegation are vested in the Secretary to the Central Board and an appeal lies to the Central Board under rule 148(1).
From an original order of the Road Traffic Board there is an appeal to the Central Board and from the original orders of the Central Board to the Government, vide rules 147 and 148 An amendment introduced by the Madras Act XX of 1948 596 and found as section 64 A in the Act vests a power of revi sion in the Provincial Government.
Besides this specific provision, there is a general provision in section 43 A that the Provincial Government may issue such orders and direc tions of a general character as it may consider necessary to the Provincial Transport Authority or a Regional Transport Authority in respect of any matter relating to road trans port; and such transport authority shall give effect to all such orders and directions.
There is, therefore, a regular hierarchy of administrative bodies established to deal with the regulation of transport by means of motor vehicles.
Thus we have before us a complete and precise scheme for regulating the issue of permits, providing what matters are to be taken into consideration as relevant, and prescribing appeals and revisions from subordinate bodies to higher authorities.
The remedies for the redress of grievances or the correction of errors are found in the statute itself and it is to these remedies that resort must generally be had.
As observed already, the issue or refusal of permits is solely within the discretion of the transport authorities and it is not a matter of right.
We are accordingly of opinion that this was not a case for interference with the discretion that was exercised by the Transport Authorities paying regard to all the facts and the surrounding circumstances.
Further, it will be noticed that the High Court here did not content itself with merely quashing the proceedings, it went further and directed the Regional Transport Authority, Tanjore, ""to grant to the petitioner permits in respect of the five buses in respect of which a joint application was made originally by the petitioner and Balasubramania Pillai and that in case the above buses have been condemned, the petitioner shall be at liberty to provide substitutes within such time as may be prescribed by the authorities.
"" Such a direction was clearly in excess of its powers and jurisdic tion.
597 For the reasons given above, the appeal is allowed and the order of the High Court set aside.
Each party will bear their own costs of these proceedings throughout.
Appeal allowed.

Where, in a dispute between two rival claimants for running through a particular route five buses, which each of them alleged he had purchased from a third person, the Central Road Traffic Board, Madras, after calling for a report from the Regional Transport Officer and considering several circumstances that had a material bearing on the case, restored the permanent permits which had been granted to one of the claimants, but on an application by the other claimant under article 226 of the Constitution to the High Court of Madras for a writ of certiorari quashing the orders of the Regional Transport Authority, the Central Road Traffic Board and the State of Madras, and for a writ of mandamus to the respondents to transfer, issue or grant 584 permanent permits to the petitioner, the High Court set aside the order of the Central Traffic Board, relying mainly on the fact that the petitioner 's title to the five buses had been established and directed the Regional Traffic Authority to grant to the petitioner permits in respect of the five buses: Held, that under the Motor Vehicles Act, the issue of a permit for a bus was not dependent on the ownership of the bus but on other considerations also, and as the Central Traffic Board had issued an order granting permits to one of the claimants after considering all circumstances the High Court acted erroneously in interfering with the Order of Traffic Board on an application under article 226 and in any event the order of the High Court issuing a direction to the Regional Transport Authority to grant permits to the other party was clearly in excess of its powers and jurisdiction.

72.txt,"N: Criminal Appeal No. 13 of 1951.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order of the High Court of Madras (Rajamannar C.J. and Balakrishna Ayyar J.) dated 10 th April, 1950, in Contempt Application No. 10 of 1949.
426 S.P. Sinha (S.S. Prakasam, with him), for the appellant.
R. Ganapathy Iyer, for the respondent.
February 14.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
This appeal has come up before us on special leave granted by this court on May 23, 1950, and it is directed against a judgment of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated April 10, 1950, by which the learned Judges found the appellant guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to serve simple imprisonment for three months.
The appellant is the publisher and managing editor of a Telugu Weekly known as ""Praja Rajyam"" which is edited and published at Nellore in the State of Madras.
In the issue of the said paper dated 10th February, 1949, an article appeared under the caption ""Is the Sub Magistrate, Kovvur, corrupt?"" The purport of the article was that Surya Narayan Murthi, the stationary Sub Magistrate of Kovvur, was known to the people of the locality to be a bribe taker and to be in the habit of harassing litigants in various ways.
He was said to have a broker, through whom negotiations in connec tion with these corrupt practices were carried on.
Several specific instances were cited of cases tried by that offi cer, where it was rumoured that he had either taken bribes or had put the parties to undue harassment, because they were obdurate enough to refuse the demands of his broker.
The article, which is a short one, concludes with the fol lowing paragraph: ""There are party factions in many villages in Kovvur Taluk.
Taking advantage of those parties many wealthy persons make attempt to get the opposite party punished either by giving bribes or making recommendations.
To appoint Magistrates who run after parties for a Taluk like this. . is to betray the public.
It is tantamount to failure of justice.
Will the Collector enquire into the matter and allay the public of their fears?"" 427 The attention of the State Government being drawn to this article, an application was filed by the AdvocateGener al of Madras before the High Court on November 14, 1949, under section 2 of the Contempt of Courts Act (Act XII of 1926) praying that suitable action might be taken against the appellant as well as three other persons, of whom two were respectively the editor and sub editor of the paper, while the third was the owner of the Press where the paper was printed.
On receiving notice, the appellant appeared before the High Court and filed an affidavit taking sole responsibility for the article objected to and asserting that the article was published because of his anxiety to uphold the highest traditions of the judiciary in the land and to create popular confidence in courts, the duty of which was to dispense justice without fear or favour and without any discrimination of caste, creed or community.
It was said that before the article was published, numerous complaints had reached him from various quarters imputing corruption and disreputable conduct to this Magistrate and the only desire of the appellant was to draw the attention of the higher authorities to the state of public opinion in the matter and to invite an enquiry into the truth or otherwise of the allegations which were not asserted as facts but were based only on hearsay.
The High Court after hearing the parties came to the conclusion that the publication in question did amount to contempt of court, as it was calculated to lower the pres tige and dignity of courts and bring into disrepute the administration of justice.
As the appellant was not prepared to substantiate the allegations which he made and which he admitted to be based on hearsay and did not think it proper even to express any regret for what he had done, the court sentenced him to simple imprisonment for three months.
The other three respondents, through their counsel, tendered unqualified apology to the court and the learned Judges considered that no further action against them was necessary.
428 The propriety of the decision of the High Court so far as it relates to the appellant has been challenged before us in this appeal and Mr. Sinha, who appeared in support of the same, raised before us a two fold contention; his first and main contention is that as the contempt in this case was said to have been committed in respect of a court subordi nate to the High Court and the allegations made in the article in question constitute an offence under section 499 of the Indian Penal Code, the jurisdiction of the High Court to take cognizance of such a case is expressly barred under section 2 (3) of the Contempt of Courts Act.
The other contention advanced by the learned counsel relates to the merits of the case and it is urged that in publishing the article objected to, the appellant acted in perfect good faith, and as the article amounted to nothing else but a demand for enquiry into the conduct of a particular person who was believed to be guilty of corrupt practices in the discharge of his judicial duties, there was no contempt of court either intended or committed by the appellant.
So far as the first point is concerned, the determina tion of the question raised by the appellant would depend upon the proper interpretation to be put upon section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act which runs as follows : ""No High Court shall take cognizance of a contempt alleged to have been committed in respect of a court subor dinate to it where such contempt is an offence punishable under the Indian Penal Code.
"" According to Mr. Sinha, what the sub section means is that if the act by which a party is alleged to have commit ted contempt of a subordinate court constitutes offence of any description whatsoever punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the High Court is precluded from taking cognizance of it.
It is said that in the present case the allegations made in the article in question amount to an offence of defama tion as defined by section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and consequently the jurisdiction of the High Court is barred.
Reliance 429 is placed in support of this proposition upon the decision of the Nagpur High Court in Kisan Krishna Ji vs Nagpur Conference of Society of St. Vincent de Paul(1).
This con tention, though somewhat plausible at first sight, does not appear to us to be sound.
In our opinion, the sub section referred to above excludes the jurisdiction of High Court only.
in cases where the acts alleged to constitute contempt of a subordinate court are punishable as contempt under specific provisions of the Indian Penal Code but not where these acts merely amount to offences of other description for which punishment has been provided for in the Indian Penal Code.
This would be clear from the language of the sub section which uses the words ""where such contempt is an offence"" and does not say ""where the act alleged to consti tute such contempt is an offence"".
It is argued that if such was the intention of the Legislature, it could have express ly said that the High Court 's jurisdiction will be ousted only when the contempt is punishable as such under the Indian Penal Code.
It seems to us that the reason for not using such language in the sub section may be that the expression ""contempt of court"" has not been used as descrip tion of any offence in the Indian Penal Code, though certain acts, which would be punishable as contempt of court in England, are made offences under it.
It may be pointed out in this connection that al though the powers of the High Courts in India established under the Letters Patent to exercise jurisdiction as Superi or Courts of Record in punishing contempt of their authority or processes have never been doubted, it was a controversial point prior to the passing of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1926, as to whether the High Court could, like the Court of King 's Bench in England, punish contempt of courts subordi nate to it in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction.
The doubt has been removed by Act XII of 1926 which expressly declares the right of the High Court to protect subordinate courts against contempt, but (1) (1943) A.I.R. 1943 Nag.
430 subject to this restriction, that cases of contempt which have already been provided for in the Indian Penal Code should not be taken cognizance of by the High Court.
This seems to be the principle underlying section 2(3)of the Contempt of Courts Act.
What these cases are need not be exhaustively determined for purposes of the present case, but some light is undoubtedly thrown upon this matter by the provision of section 480 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which empowers any civil, criminal or revenue court to punish summarily a person who is found guilty of committing any offence under sections 176, 178, 179, 180 or section 228 of the Indian Penal Code in the view or presence of the court.
We are not prepared to say, as has been said by the Patna High Court in Jnanendra prasad vs Gopal(1), that the only section of the Indian Penal Code which deals with contempt committed against a court of justice or judicial officer is section 228.
Offences under sections 175, 178, 179 and 180 may also, as section 480 of the Criminal Proce dure Code shows, amount to contempt of court if the ""public servant"" referred to in these sections happens to be a judicial officer in a particular case.
It is well known that the aim of the contempt proceeding is ""to deter men from offering any indignities to a court of justice"" and an essential feature of the proceeding is the exercise of a summary power by the court itself in regard to the delin quent.
In the cases mentioned in section 480 of the Indian Penal Code, the court has been expressly given summary powers to punish a person who is guilty of offending its dignity in the manner indicated in the section.
The court is competent also under section 482 of the Criminal Proce dure Code to forward any case of this description to a Magistrate having jurisdiction to try it, if it considers that the offender deserves a higher punishment than what can be inflicted under section 480.
Again, the court is enti tled under section 484 to discharge the offender on his submitting an apology, although it has already adjudged him to punishment under section Pat.
172. 431 or forwarded his case for trial under section 482.
The mode of purging contempt by tendering apology is a further char acteristic of a contempt proceeding.
It seems, therefore, that there are offences which are punishable as contempt under the Indian Penal Code and as subordinate courts can sufficiently vindicate their dignity under the provisions of criminal law in such cases the legislature deemed it proper to exclude them from the jurisdiction of the High Court under section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act;but it would not be correct to ' say that the High Court 's juris diction is excluded even in cases where the act complained of, which is alleged to constitute contempt, is otherwise an offence under the Indian Penal Code.
This view has been taken and, in our opinion quite rightly, in a number of decisions by the Calcutta,(1) Patna,(2) Allahabad(3) and Lahore(4) High Courts.
The only authority which Mr. Sinha could cite in support of his contention is the decision of the Nagpur High Court in Kisan Krishna Ji vs Nagpur Conference of Society of St. Vincent de Paul("").
The authority is undoubtedly in his favour as it proceeds upon the assumption that the idea underlying the provision of section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act is that if a person can be punished by some other tribunal, then the High Court should not entertain any proceeding for contempt.
It is to be noticed that the learned Judge, who decided this case, himself took the opposite view in the case of Subordinate Judge, First Class, Hoshangabad vs Jawaharlal(6) and definitely held that the prohibition contained in section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act refers to offences punishable as contempt of court by the Indian Penal Code and not to offences punishable otherwise than as contempt.
This decision was neither noticed nor dissented from in the subsequent case, and it is quite possible that (1) Narayan Chandra vs Panehu Pramanik (A.I.R. ; Naresh Kumar.v.
Umaromar (A.I.R. 1951 Cal.
(2)Kaulashia vs Emperor (12 Pat. 1).
(3) State vs Brahma Prakash (A.I.R. 1950 All. 556); Emperor vs Jagannath (A.I.R. 1938 All. 358).
(4) Bennett Coleman vs G. section Monga (I.L.R. (5) A.I.R. 1943 Nag.
(6) A.I.R. 1940 Nag.
56 432 the attention of the learned judge was not drawn to this earlier pronouncement of his, in which case the matter would certainly have been more fully discussed.
We think further that the decision of the Calcutta High Court in V.M. Bason vs A. H. Skone(1) which was the basis of the decision of the learned Judge in the subsequent case does not really support the view taken in it.
In the Calcutta case what happened was, that a clerk of the Attorney, who appeared for the respondent decreeholder, went to serve a notice under Order 21, Rule 37(1), of the Civil Procedure Code upon the appellant judgment debtor.
The judgmentdebtor refused to take the notice and abused and assaulted the Attorney 's clerk.
Upon that, contempt proceedings were started against him and Mr. Justice C.C. Ghosh, sitting on the Original Side of the High Court of Calcutta, held the appellant guilty of contempt and fined him Rs. 200.
On appeal, this judgment was affirmed by the appellate Bench and there was a general observation made by Chief Justice Sanderson at the close of his judgment that it is not desirable to invoke the special inherent jurisdiction of the High Court by way of proceeding for contempt if ordinary proceedings in a Magistrate 's court are sufficient to meet the requirements of a case.
This was not a case under section 2(3) of the Contempt of Courts Act at all and no question either arose or was decided as to whether if an act is otherwise punishable as an offence under the Indian Penal Code the jurisdiction of the High Court under that section would be ousted.
Undoubtedly the High Court had jurisdiction in that case and whether such jurisdiction, which is certainly of a special character and is exercised summarily, should be called in to aid in the circumstances of a particular case would depend upon the discretion of the court.
This has, however, no bearing on the point that has arisen for consideration before us.
We would hold, therefore, that the right view was taken by the learned Judge of the Nagpur High Court in the earlier case and not in the later one, (1) I.L R. 433 It is next urged by Mr. Sinha that even assuming that this view is correct, the language of section 499 of the Indian Penal Code is wide enough to cover a case of contempt of court.
What is said is, that if a libel is published against a judge in respect of his judicial functions, that also is defamation within the meaning of section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and as such libel constitutes a contempt of court, it may be said with perfect propriety that libel on a judge is punishable as contempt under the Indian Penal Code.
We do not think that this contention can be accepted as sound.
A libellous reflection upon the conduct of a judge in respect of his judicial duties may certainly come under section 499 of the Indian Penal Code and it may be open to the judge to take steps against the libeller in the ordinary way for vindication of his character and personal dignity as a judge; but such libel may or may not amount to contempt of court.
As the Privy Council observed in Surendra Nath Banerjee vs The Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court,(1) ""although contempt may include defamation, yet an offence of contempt is something more than mere defamation and is of a different character.
"" When the act of defaming a judge is calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice or proper administration of law, it would certainly amount to contempt.
TIle offence of con tempt is really a wrong done to the public by weakening the authority and influence of courts of law which exist for their good.
As was said by Willmot, C.J.(2) ""attacks upon the judges excite in the minds of the people a general dissatisfaction with all judicial determi nations. and whenever man 's allegiance to the laws is so fundamentally shaken it is the most fatal and dangerous obstruction of justice and in my opinion calls out for a more rapid and immediate redress than any other obstruction whatsoever; not for the sake of the judges as private indi viduals but because they are the channels by which the King 's justice is conveyed to the people"".
(1) I.L.R. at 131.
(2) Willmot 's Opinions page 256; Rex vs Davies 30 at p. 40 41. 434 What is made punishable in the Indian Penal Code is the offence of defamation as defamation and not as.
contempt of court.
If the defamation of a subordinate court amounts to contempt of court, proceedings can certainly be taken under section 2 of the Contempt of Courts Act, quite apart from the fact that other remedy may be open to the aggrieved officer under section 499 of the Indian Penal Code.
But a libel attacking the integrity of a judge may not in the circumstances of a particular case amount to a contempt at all, although it may be the subject matter of a libel pro ceeding.
This is clear from the observation of the Judicial Committee in the case of The Matter of a Special Reference from the Bahama Islands(1).
The first contention of Mr. Sinha, therefore, fails.
The second point raised by the learned counsel does not appear to us to have any real substance.
The article in question is a scurrilous attack on the integrity and honesty of a judicial officer.
Specific instances have been given where the officer is alleged to have taken bribes or behaved with impropriety to the litigants who did not satisfy his dishonest demands.
If the allegations were true, obviously it would be to the benefit of the public to bring these matters into light.
But if they were false, they cannot but undermine the confidence of the public in the administration of justice and bring judiciary into disrepute.
The appel lant, though he took sole responsibility regarding the publication of the article, was not in a position to sub stantiate by evidence any of the allegations made therein.
He admitted that the statement was based on hearsay.
Ru mours may have reached him from various sources, but before he published the article it was incumbent upon him as a reasonable man to attempt to verify the informations he received and ascertain, as far as he could.
whether the facts were true or mere concocted lies.
He does not appear to have made any endeavour in this direction.
As the appel lant did not act with reasonable care and caution, he cannot be said to have acted (1) 435 bona fide, even if good faith can be held to be a defence at all in a proceeding for contempt.
What is more, he did not express any regret for what he had done either in the High Court or before us and his behaviour does not show the least trace of contrition.
In these circumstances, we think that the appeal cannot succeed and must be dismissed.
Appeal dismissed.
","Sub sec.
(3) of section 2 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1926, excludes the jurisdiction of the High Court to take cognisance of a contempt alleged to have been committed in respect of a Court subordinate to it only in cases where the acts alleged to constitute contempt are punishable as con tempt under specific provisions of the Indian Penal Code, but not where these acts merely amount to offences of other description for which punishment has been provided for in the Indian Penal Code.
The fact that defamation of a judge of a subordinate Court constitutes an offence under sec.
499 of the Indian Penal Code does not, therefore, oust the jurisdiction of the High Court to take cognisance of the act as a contempt of court.
Defamatory statements about the conduct of a judge even in respect of his judicial duties do not necessarily consti tute contempt of Court.
It is only when the defamation is calculated to obstruct or interfere with the due course of justice or proper administration of justice that it amounts to contempt.

73.txt,"Civil Appeal No. 99 of 1951.
Appeal from a Judgment and Decree of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay (Stone C.J. and Dixit 3.) dated 14th July, 1947, in First Appeal No. 128 of 1943 affirming a decree dated 14th October, 1942, of the Court of the Dis trict Judge of Kaira at Nadiad in Civil Suit No. 15 of 1928.
514 C.K. Daphtary (N. C. Shah, with him) for the appellant.
Rajani Patel for the respondent.
March 7.
The judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
This appeal is on behalf of the defendant and it arises out of a suit, under section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code, commenced by the plaintiffs who were origi nally nine in number in the court of the District Judge of Kaira at Nadiad.
Out of the nine plaintiffs, only one is surviving, and he is now the sole respondent in this appeal, all the rest having died pending this protracted litigation, which began as early as the year 1928.
The case of the plaintiffs, in substance, was that one Kuberdas, who was a religious teacher and a holy man rounded a cult known as Kaivalya or Karunasagar Panth, the principal tenet of which is that the realization of the Infinite is possible only through the medium of a Guru or spiritual preceptor.
Kuberdas received money and lands from his followers and disciples and with this fund he built a temple at Sarsa.
Kuberdas by will appointed his principal disciple Narayandas to succeed him on the Gadi and Narayandas built another and a bigger temple wherein he installed an image of Kuberdas, with the images of two staff bearers on two sides.
The Mahants after Narayandas were Baldevdas, Bhagwandas and Pragdasji, who is the defendant in the suit and each one of them was appointed by a will executed by his predecessor.
The defendant, it is alleged, had been acting in a manner contrary to the usages of the institution and was guilty of incontinence, mismanagement and improper alienation of trust properties.
On these allegations the plaintiffs prayed that: (1) the properties described in the schedule to the plaint as well as other properties under the management of the defendant be declared to be religious and charitable trust properties of the Kaivalya or Karuna sagar Panth; 515 (2) the defendant be removed from the Gadi and posses sion of the properties and a suitable successor appointed in his place; (3) the defendant be called upon to render accounts for the period of his management; and (4) a scheme might be framed for proper management of the institution.
The defendant in his written statement traversed all the material allegations in the plaint and contended infer alia that the suit was not maintainable inasmuch as no public trust of a religious and charitable character existed in respect to the suit properties which were the private properties of the defendant himself.
On these pleadings, a number of issues were framed by the District Judge, of which the two following were tried as preliminary issues, viz., (1) Whether the temple and the properties in suit are public charitable properties ? and (2) if not, whether this court has jurisdiction to try the suit ? By his judgment dated the 18th of July, 1935, the Dis trict Judge decided both these issues against the plaintiffs and dismissed the suit.
Against this decision the plain tiffs took an appeal to the High Court of Bombay.
The learned Judges of the High Court, who heard the appeal, took the view that the ownership of.
the suit properties was so restricted by the obligation to maintain the institu tion for purposes which only could be described as public charitable purposes, that the suit must be regarded as one coming within section 92, Civil Procedure Code.
The result was that the judgment of the trial court was reversed and the case was remanded to that court in order that it might be heard and disposed of on its merits.
The judgment of the High Court is dated 24th of January, 1938.
Being aggrieved by this order, the defendant prayed leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee, but this application was refused.
He thereupon filed a petition before the privy Council praying for special leave.
516 The Privy Council also refused to grant leave on the ground that the matter was still then in an interlocutory stage.
They, however, said specifically that the order of refusal was without prejudice to the presentation of a fresh peti tion after all the issues were determined.
The case then went back to the trial court and on the evidence adduced by the parties, the District Judge came to the conclusion that the allegations of misconduct and breach of trust made by the plaintiffs were not proved and in this view he dismissed the suit, subject to the declaration already given by the High Court that the temple and the properties in possession of the defendant were public, religious and charitable properties.
The plaintiffs filed an appeal against this decision to the High Court of Bombay and the High Court by its judgment dated 14th of July, 1947, affirmed the decision of the District Judge and dismissed the appeal.
The defendant has now come up to this court on the strength of a certificate granted by the High Court; and though formally it is an appeal against the final decree made by the High Court on 14th of July, 1947, in substance it challenges the propriety of the order of remand passed on 24th January, 1938, by which the High Court reversed the decree of dismissal made by the District Judge and remanded the case, being of opinion that the properties in dispute did appertain to a public trust of a religious and charita ble character.
Mr. Daphtary appearing in support of the appeal has contended before us that on the question as to whether or not a public trust existed in respect of the properties in suit, the view taken by the trial judge was right and that the decision of the High Court is based upon a misapprecia tion of the evidence on the record.
We have been taken through the entire evidence by the learned counsel on both sides; but having regard to the view which we propose to take in this case we deem it unnecessary to record any finding as to whether the properties in suit do or do not appertain to a public charitable trust.
In our opinion, after the 517 decision arrived at concurrently, by both the courts below on the merits of the case, it was beyond the scope of a suit framed under section 92, Civil Procedure Code, to give the plaintiffs a bare declaration of this character and make it a part of the decree, although the suit itself was dis missed.
A suit under section 92, Civil Procedure Code, is a suit of a special nature which presupposes the existence of a public trust of a religious or charitable character.
Such suit can proceed only on the allegation that there is a breach of such trust or that directions from the court are necessary for the administration thereof, and it must pray for one or other of the reliefs that are specifically men tioned in the section.
It is only when these conditions are fulfilled that the suit has got to be brought in conformity with the provision of section 92, Civil Procedure Code.
As was observed by the Privy Council in Abdur Rahim vs Barkat Ali(1), a suit for a declaration that certain property appertains to a religious trust may lie under the general law but is outside the scope of section 92, Civil Procedure Code.
In the case before us, the prayers made in the plaint are undoubtedly appropriate to the terms of section 92 and the suit proceeded on the footing that the defendant, who was alleged to be the trustee in respect of a public trust, was guilty of breach of trust.
The defendant denied the existence of the trust and denied further that he was guilty of misconduct or breach of trust.
The denial could not certainly oust the jurisdiction of the court, but when the courts found concurrently, on the evidence adduced by the parties, that the allegations of breach of trust were not made out, and as it was not the case of the plaintiffs, that any direction of the court was necessary for proper adminis tration of the trust, the very foundation of a suit under section 92, Civil Procedure Code, became wanting and the plaintiffs had absolutely no cause of action for the suit they instituted.
In these circumstances, the finding of the High Court about the existence of a public trust was wholly inconsequential and as it was (1) (1928) 55 I.A. 96, 67 518 unconnected with the grounds upon which the case was actual ly disposed of, it could not be made a part of the decree or the final order in the shape of a declaratory relief in favour of the plaintiffs.
It has been argued by the learned counsel for the respondents that even if the plaintiffs failed to prove the other allegations made in the plaint, they did succeed in proving that the properties were public and charitable trust properties a fact which the defendant denied.
In these circumstances, there was nothing wrong for the court to give the plaintiffs a lesser relief than what they actually claimed.
The reply to this is, that in a suit framed under section 92 of the Civil Procedure Code the only reliefs which the plaintiff can Claim and the court can grant are those enumerated specifically in the different clauses of t, he section.
A relief praying for a declaration that the properties in suit are trust properties does not come under any of these clauses.
When the defendant denies the existence of a trust, a declaration that the trust does exist might be made as ancillary to the main relief claimed under the section if the plaintiff is held entitled to it; but when the case of the plaintiff fails for want of a cause of action, there is no warrant for giving him a declaratory relief under the provision of section 92, Civil Procedure Code.
The finding as to the existence of a public trust in such circumstances would be no more than an obiter dictum and cannot constitute the final decision in the suit.
The result is that in our ' opinion the decision of the High Court should stand, but the decree and the concluding por tion, of the judgment passed by the trial court and affirmed by the High Court on appeal shall direct a ' dismissal of the plaintiff 's suit merely without its being made subject to any declaration as to the character of the properties.
To this extent the appeal is allowed and the final decree modified.
The order for costs made by the courts below will stand.
Each party will bear his own costs in this appeal.
","In a suit under sec.
92 of the Civil Procedure Code alleging that the defendant had been guilty of misconduct and breach of trust as Mahant and praying, inter alia, that the temple and properties in suit be declared as a religious and charitable trust and the defendant be removed from the Gadi and a suitable successor appointed in his place, the District Judge and the High Court held concurrently that the defendant was not guilty of misconduct or breach of trust and dismissed the suit, but made a declaration to the effect that the temple and properties in the possession of defend ant belonged to a public trust of a religious and charitable character: Held, that a suit under sec.
92, Civil Procedure Code, is a suit of a special character which presupposes the existence of a public trust of a religious or charitable character and it can proceed only when there is a breach of such trust or directions from the Court are necessary for the administration thereof and it must pray for one or other of the reliefs that are specifically mentioned in the sec tion; and therefore as the Courts found concurrently that the allegations of breach of trust were not made out and no direction of the Court for proper administration of trust was sought, the very foundation of a suit under sec.
92, Civil Procedure Code, became wanting and the plaintiffs had no cause of action for their suit; and in the circumstances the declaration of the High Court about the existence of a public trust was inconsequential and was no more than an obiter dictum and such declaration must be deleted from the decree dismissing the suit.

74.txt,"Criminal Appeal No. 50 of 1951.
Appeal by SpeciaI Leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 26th September, 1950, of the High Court of Judicature of Nagpur (Herneon Acting C.J. and Hidayat Ullah J.) in Criminal Appeal No. 251 of 1950 arising out of Judg ment dated the 2nd August, 1950, of the Court of Sessions Judge, Jabalpur, in Sessions Trial No. 32 of 1950.
568 S.P. Sinha and M.Y. Sharif, Nuruddin Ahmad and (Shaukat Hussain, with them) for the appellant.
Gopal Singh for the respondent.
March 20.
The Judgment of the court was delivered by BOSE J.
The main question in this case is whether there is a right of private defence.
Most of the facts are not in dispute.
A communal ' riot broke out at Katni on the 5th of March, 1950, between some Sindhi refugees resident in the town and the local Muslims.
The trouble started in the locality known as Zanda Bazar or Zanda Chowk.
Police Constable Bharat Singh, P.W. 17, who made the First Information Re port, said that most of the shopkeepers in Zanda Bazar are Sindhis.
He stated that when he was to1d that trouble had broken out there he proceeded to the spot and found that the goods in the Muslim shops in that locality were scattered.
It is also in evidence that some Muslims lost their lives.
From this place he went on to Subash Chowk, the locality in which the appellant 's shop is situate.
It lies to the West of Zanda Bazar.
He states that when he got there he found a ""crowd"" there but not a ""mob"".
He admitted that he had said in the First Information Report that a gun was fired a minute after he had reached the spot and he said that what he had stated in the First Information Report was true.
It is not disputed that this shot was fired by the appellant, as also a second shot, and that that caused the death of one man (a Sindhi) and injured three others, also Sindhis.
The map, exhibit D 4, shows that the shops of the appellant and his brother Zahid Khan run into each other and form two sides of a rectangle, the appellant 's house facing north and the brother 's house facing east.
Each shop opens out on to a road.
569 It is proved that when the rioting broke out in the Zanda Chowk the alarm spread to the appellant 's locality and the people there, including the appellant, started closing their shops.
The appellant 's version is that the mob approached his locality and broke into the portion of the building facing east in which his brother 's shop is situate and looted it.
The High Court holds that this is proved and holds further that this preceded the firing by the appellant.
There is a hole in the wall between the two portions of the building in which these two shops are situate and the High Court holds that Zahid 's family got into the appel lant 's portion of the building through this hole and took refuge there.
The High Court also holds that the appel lant 's mother then told the appellant that the crowd had burst into his (appellant 's) shop and was looting it.
The learned Judges state that what he said was not quite true because all that the crowd did was to beat the door of the appellant 's shop with lathis as they were passing but had not broken into the shop.
But they accept the fact that the crowd was beating the doors of the appellant 's shop with their lathis.
In our opinion, the facts found by the High Court are sufficient to afford a right of private defence.
Under section 97 of the indian Penal Code the right extends not only to the defence of one 's own body against any offence affecting the human body but also to defending the body of any other person.
The right also embraces the protection of property, whether one 's own or another person 's, against certain specified offences, namely theft, robbery, mischief and criminal trespass.
The limitations on this right and its scope are set out in the sections which follow.
For one thing, the right does not arise if there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities, and for another, it does not extend to the infliction of more harm than is necessary for the purpose of defence.
Another limitation is that when death is 570 caused the person exercising the right must be under reason able apprehension of death, or grievous hurt, to himself or to those whom he is protecting; and in the case of property, the danger to it must be of the kinds specified in section 103.
The scope of the right is further explained in sec tions 102 and 105 of the Indian Penal Code.
Neither the learned High Court Judges nor the Sessions Judge has analysed these provisions.
Both Courts appear to be under the impression that actual looting of the appel lant 's shop was necessary before the right could arise.
In that they are wrong.
Under section 102 the right of private defence of the body commences ""As soon as a reasonable apprehension of the danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed.
"" Examining the provisions we have set out above, it is evident that the appellant had no time to have recourse to the authorities.
The mob or crowd had already broken into one part of the building and was actually beating on the doors of the other part.
It is also evident that the appel lant had reasonable grounds for apprehending that either death or grievous hurt would be caused either to himself or his family learned Sessions Judge has eloquently drawn attention to the lamentable consequences of communal frenzy in India and in Katni in particular, and he refers to the indiscriminate looting of Muslim shops in that town.
So also the High Court holds that "" Looking to the circumstances which had existed in the country before and the fact that the trouble was between the refugees and the local Muslims it cannot be said that there would be no danger to the life of the appellant or at least of grievous hurt if the mob had entered his shop and he prevented it.
The apprehension would undoubtedly be reason able.
"" And we know that Muslim shops had already been broken into and looted and Muslims killed in the 571 rioting at Zanda Chowk which preceded this, in our opinion, the High Court was wrong in thinking that the appellant had to wait until the mob actually broke into his shop and entered it.
They have emphasised this in another part of their judgment also where they say that the shot was fired "" when there was no looting at the shop and thus no right of private defence.
"" It was enough that the mob had actually broken into another part of the house and looted it, that the woman and children of his family fled to the appellant for protection in terror of their lives and that the mob was actually beating at his own doors with their lathis and that Muslim shops had already been looted and Muslims killed in the adjoining locality.
It was impossible for him to know whether his shop would or would not suffer the same fate if he waited, and on the findings it was reasonable for him to apprehend death or grievous hurt to himself and his family once they broke in, for he would then have had the right to protest and indeed would have been bound to do what he could to protect his family.
The threat to break in was implicit in the conduct of the mob and with it the threat to kill or cause grievous hurt to the inmates; indeed the High Court Judges themselves hold that his own shop was menaced.
The circumstances in which he was placed were amply sufficient to give him a right of private defence of the body even to the extent of causing death.
These things cannot be weighed in too fine a set of scales or, as some learned Judges have expressed it, in golden scales.
We have next to see whether the appellant used more force than was necessary, and here also we cannot use golden scales.
He was entitled to cause death and he did not kill more than one man.
He fired only two shots and, as the learned High Court Judges observe, he obviously aimed low.
The High Court holds the mob had moved up to his locality When he fired the shots, so the looting and the beating 572 on the doors were not the isolated acts of a few scattered individuals.
It was the mob that was doing it and in the High Court 's words, ""The very fact that in the town of Katni two shots should have struck four Sindhis and none else shows that the rival community was on the move in that area.
"" In our opinion, the appellant did not use more force than was necessary.
Indeed, the firing, far from acting as a deterrent, spurred them on and they ransacked and looted the place.
We have confined our attention to the right of private defence of the person though in this case the question about the defence of property happens to be bound up with it.
The appeal is allowed.
The convictions and sentences are set aside and the appellant will be released.
","A communal riot broke out in a town between some Sindhi refugees and the local Muslims.
The trouble started in a locality where most of the shopkeepers were Sindhis.
The goods in the Muslim shops there were scattered and some Muslims lost their lives.
Alarm spread to another locality where the shops of appellant and his brother (both Muslims) were situated and the people there, including the appellant, started closing their shops.
The family of the appellant 's brother had taken shelter in the appellant 's portion of the building through a hole in the wall between the two portions of the building in which the two shops were situated.
A mob collected there and approached the appellant 's locality and looted his brother 's shop and began to beat the doors of his shop with lathis.
The appellant fired two shots from his gun which caused the death of one Sindhi and injured three other Sindhis.
The question for determination was whether the appellant acted in his right of private defence: Held, that the facts of the case afforded a right of private defence to the appellant under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code.
The circumstances in which he was placed were amply sufficient to give him a right of private defence of the body even to the extent of causing death as the appellant had no time to have recourse to the authorities and has reasonable grounds for apprehending that either death or grievous hurt would be caused either to himself or to his family.
These things could not be weighed in too fine a set of scales or ""in golden scales.""

April 2.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.
These appeals are directed against the judgment and decrees of the High Court of Judicature at Calcutta, dated 23rd February, 1945, reversing the judgment and decrees passed by the District Judge of Birbhum dated 16th December, 1938.
The principal questions for determina tion are the same in 102 784 all of them and can be conveniently disposed of by one judgment.
It is necessary to set out briefly the history of this half a century old litigation I The seven suits out of which arise Appeals Nos.
68 to 74 were filed in September, 1904, by Maharaja Bahadur Singh in the court of the differ ent Munsifs at Rampurhat, against Raja Ranjit Singh Bahadur, deceased, and others, for a declaration of his title to the lands mentioned in the different suits and for mesne profits from the year 1899 till recovery of possession.
It was alleged that the lands in the several suits were chowkidari chakran lands within the plaintiff 's patnidari, granted to his predecessors in interest on 14th November, 1853, by the ancestors of the defendant, that as the lands were in the possession of village watchmen on service tenures, they were excluded from assessment of land revenue and no rent was paid on them, that in the year 1899 under the provisions of sections 50 and 51 of Bengal Act VI of 1870 Government resumed the lands, terminated the service tenures and settled them with the zamindar, that in this situation the plaintiff as patnidar became entitled to their actual physi cal possession, that the zamindar wrongfully took physical possession of them and denied the right of the plaintiff and hence he was entitled to the reliefs claimed.
The suits were decreed on 17th August, 1905, and 19th August, 1905, by the two courts respectively and the decisions were affirmed on appeal by the District Judge.
On special appeal to the High Court, the suits were remanded for trial on the ques tion of limitation, and after remand they were dismissed by the trial court and the Court of appeal as barred by limita tion.
On second appeal, it was held that the suits were within limitation and were then decreed for the second time.
This decision was affirmed on appeal to His Majesty in Council.
The plaintiff actually obtained possession of the lands involved in these suits in August, 1913.
An applica tion was made for ascertainment of mesne profits on 785 6th November, 1918.
This was resisted by the defendant and it was pleaded that the plaintiff was not entitled to inter est on mesne profits, that the zamindar was entitled to receive the profits of the disputed lands and that deduc tion should be made out of the amount of the mesne profits on account of munafa and the amount of chowkidari dues as well as cesses due to him or paid by him.
Five years later, on 24th June, 1927, another set of objections was filed by the zamindar claiming deduction out of mesne profits by way of equitable set off of the payments made by him subsequent to the date of delivery possession as well as for the amount of munafa that became payable to him after that date.
After a prolonged enquiry the trial court on 18th December, 1937, decreed the plaintiff 's claim for mesne profits after allow ing the zamindar the deductions claimed by him up to the date of assessment of mesne profits but disallowed the amount claimed by way of equitable set off for the subse quent period.
The learned District Judge on appeal reversed this decision and allowed the defendant the amount claimed by him by way of equitable set off, subject, however, to the condition that the dues of the defendant should be deducted from the dues of the plaintiff till the defendant 's dues were wiped off.
The relevant part of his judgment runs thus : ""The broad fact is that they (plaintiffs) have been in possession of the lands since 1910 and have been in enjoy ment of rent from the tenants from that date and according to law they are not entitled to possess the land uncondi tionally.
Now that all the facts are before the court and the time has come for final adjustment of accounts between the parties the court should try to do substantial justice between the parties.
It is not sufficient answer to say that the plea of equitable set off was not raised in the beginning.
The circumstances in all these cases are pecul iar and it could hardly be expected that such plea would have been taken in the very beginning.
The course of liti gation in these cases has not run along 786 easy and smooth channels: on the contrary its course has been extremely tortuous and disturbed frequently by con flicting decisions.
No one could have reason ably antici pated in the beginning that the litigation would be pro tracted in this extraordinary way.
It is the duty of the court to take notice of the subsequent events in order to do justice between the parties .
As we are dealing with the question of equitable set off, no question of time barred debts or unascertained sum can arise .
The plea of equitable set off in respect of time barred debts can be set up as a shield by way of defence nor can any question of payment of court fees arise.
There is, in my opinion, no substantial difference in the character of the respective parties during the entire period and it would be futile to make an attempt at distinction by oversubtle argument where there is really no difference in substance.
There is considerable force in the argument advanced on the side of the appellant, namely, the appellant 's claim to the equitable set off is really in the nature of cross demand arising out of the same transaction and connected in its nature and circumstances .
From whatever standpoint the matter may be looked at I am of the opinion that the claim of the appellant for equitable set off for the subsequent period by way of deduction of the chowkidari revenue and cess paid by him as well as on account of munafa should be allowed.
This amount will also carry interest at 6 per cent per annum up to date.
The subsequent period means the period since the date of delivery of possession up to 1927 28.
"" Against the judgment and decrees of the District Judge the plaintiff preferred appeals to the High Court at Calcut ta.
The High Court by the judgment under appeal modified the decrees of the District Judge and disallowed the claim for equitable set off in its entirety for the subsequent period and restored the decree of the trial court.
The zamindar filed applications for leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council.
These applications were consolidated with similar applications filed in the second batch of suits.
A certifi cate 787 was granted for leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council.
By an order dated 9th June, 1947, all the appeals were admitted and it was directed that the proceedings be printed and.
transmitted to England.
During the pendency of the proceedings in the High Court, Raja Bhupendra Narayan Singh died and the present appellant was impleaded as his heir and representative.
An application was also made in the High Court for permission to urge additional grounds not already taken.
After the abolition of the jurisdiction of the Privy Council these appeals were transmitted to this Court.
An application under Order XIX, rule 4, of the Supreme Court Rules was presented at the hearing of the appeals that the appellant be allowed to urge the following additional grounds in support of the appeals, viz. : (1) That the munafa (rent) should not be calculated on the basis of the principles laid down in Radhacharan vs Maharaja Ranjit Singh(1).
(2) That the said munafa should have been assessed on a fair share of the profits from the land.
The second batch of appeals (Nos. 75 to 92 of 1951) arises out of 18 suits instituted in the court of the Munsif of Rampurhat on 22nd December, 1909, by Ganpat Singh and Narpat Singh, predecessors in interest of respondents 1 to 3 against the predecessor in interest of the appellant, late Raja Ranjit Singh Bahadur, and also some other persons who were tenants under him, for a declaration of the plaintiffs ' title to the resumed chowkidari chakran lands and for khas possession of the same and for mesne profits.
The allega tions in these suits were the same as in the first set of suits.
The defence to the suits was also the same.
The suits were decreed by the trial Judge on 30th September, 1910, in the following terms : ""The plaintiffs ' title is declared to the lands in suit and they will get khas possession of the same by ejecting the tenant defendants; on condition of paying (1) 788 to the defendant No. 1 an additional rent, to be deter mined on the principle that the original patni rent should bear the same ratio to the patni rent now payable by the plaintiffs as the original Hustbood at the time of the creation of the patni should bear to the present increased Hustbood, or any other fair and equitable rent which may be determined at the time of assessing the mesne profits.
The plaintiffs will get Wasilat from defendant No. 1 up to the date of delivery of possession of the land in suit to them.
The amount will be determined in a separate enquiry."" The District Judge on appeal remanded the cases for determination of the conditions and terms under which the patnidar was to hold the lands under the zamindar and directed ascertainment of profits.
The plaintiffs ob tained delivery of possession of the lands in the mean while on 23rd November, 1910.
Against the remand order appeals were preferred to the High Court and the High Court decreed the appeals in these terms : ""We set aside the portion of the decision of the Dis trict Judge which remands the cases to the original court to determine the conditions under which the patnidar is to hold the lands under the zamindar.
Rest of the remand order will stand.
That portion of the Munsif 's decree, which imposes on the appellant, as a condition of obtain ing khas possession, the payment of additional rent to the zamindar will be set aside.
"" Against these decrees appeals were preferred to His Majesty in Council by special leave.
The Privy Council set aside the decrees of the High Court and observed as follows : ""Their Lordships, therefore, see no reason for inter fering with the long series of authorities commencing as far back as the year 1900, which have established the right of the zamindar to have an additional rent fixed for such lands nor can their Lordships overlook the fact that in the cases already referred before this Board no exception was taken by the patnidar to the 789 fixing of such rents as a condition of being put into pos session.
"" On 8th December, 1922, the plaintiffs filed applications in these suits for ascertainment of mesne profits for the years 1906 to 1910.
Objections were taken on behalf of the defendant on the 17th April, 1923, and it was contended that the plaintiffs may be allowed mesne profits to the extent of the amount that would be found due after deduction of the amount of rent to which the defendant was entitled in re spect of the lands in suit according to the judgment of the munsif.
On the 28th May, 1927, another application was filed by the zamindar claiming deduction by way of equitable set off of the amounts due to him for rent from 1910 onwards and on account of subsequent payment made by him towards revenue and cesses.
After a prolonged enquiry the munsif ultimately on the 18th December, 1937, decreed the plaintiff 's claim for mesne profits after allowing deduc tions for the amounts claimed by the defendant up to the date of delivery of possession.
He held that the appellant was not entitled to get any amount by way of equitable set off in respect of sums of money spent by him in payment of revenue and cesses or for the amount of munafa or profits for the period subsequent to the date of delivery of posses sion.
The District Judge on appeal by his judgment dated the 16th December, 1938, allowed the claim of equitable set off for the period subsequent to delivery of possession and directed that ""from the plaintiffs dues, the dues of the defendant are to be deducted and if after these deduc tions any sum is due to the plaintiffs they will get a decree for that sum.
If it is found on calculations in some cases that the dues of the defendant exceed the dues of the plaintiffs, in such cases the prayer of the plaintiffs for mesne profits must be dismissed.
"" Against this decision special appeals were preferred to the High Court and by the judgment under appeal the decision of the trial court was restored.
Applications were then made for leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council and 790 those were allowed and a certificate was granted for pre ferring those appeals.
Because of the abolition of the jurisdiction of the Privy Council those appeals are now before us for decision.
The points for decision in all these appeals are the following : 1.
Whether the appellant is entitled to deduct by way of equitable set off from the amount of mesne profits the amounts due to him on account of rent, revenue and cesses for the period subsequent to the dates of delivery of pos session.
Whether interest should be allowed on the amount of mesne profits found due, and if so, at what rate.
Whether the rent due to the appellant from the patnidar on those funds should be calculated on the basis of annual assets of the land (as in Radhacharan vs Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1), or on a fair and equitable basis.
The claim for set off for the period for which mesne profits were claimed has been allowed and is not in these appeals.
As regards the amounts due to the appellant by way of rent subsequent to the date of transfer of possession, the claim is unconnected with the subjectmatter of the different suits.
It seems clear that a plea in the nature of equita ble set off is not available when the cross demands do not arise out of the same transaction.
Mesne profits due to the plaintiff relate to the period during which the appellant was in wrongful possession of the lands and the amounts claimed by the defendant relate tO a period when he was no longer in possession and had ceased to be a trespasser.
No mesne profits are claimable for that period.
The right of the appellant to recover additional rents from the plaintiff arises out of a different cause of action and independently of the claim for mesne profits.
If the patnidar after having entered into possession had defaulted in the payment of the (1) (1918)27 C.L J. 532, 791 additional rents due for any period, nothing stood in the way of the appellant from recovering the.
in by appropriate legal proceedings.
The prolongation of the enquiry for ascertainment of the mesne profits cannot support a claim for equitable set off for the period subsequent to the delivery of possession to the plaintiff.
It is obvious that no claim for equitable set off against mesne profits during the pendency of the suits could be made for the sums deduction of which is now sought, as the amounts had not then accrued due and his right to them had not yet arisen.
The learned District Judge was in error in holding that the appellant 's claim for equitable set off was in the nature of a cross demand arising out of the same transaction and connected in its nature and circumstances.
He failed to appreciate that the transaction which led to plaintiff 's demand resulted from the defendant 's wrongful act as a trespasser, while the transaction giving rise to the appellant 's demand arises out of the relationship of landlord and tenant and the obligations resulting therefrom.
A wrongdoer who has wrongfully withheld moneys belonging to another cannot invoke any principles of equity in his favour and seek to deduct therefrom the amounts that during this period have fallen due to him.
There is nothing improper or unjust in telling the wrongdoer to undo his wrong, and not to take advantage of it.
Such a person cannot be helped on any principles of equity to recover amounts for the recovery of which he could have taken action in due course of law and which for some unexplained reason he failed to take and which claim may have by now become barred by limitation.
It was contended that it was only after the decree of the Privy Council that the appellant 's rights to the addi tional rent was finally established and till then no legal steps could be taken to enforce this demand.
The contention is without force.
The appellant 's right to additional rent had been established by the decree of the trial court in execution of which possession passed from him to the patni dar.
The Privy 103 792 Council only affirmed this.decision.
The patnidars under the decree were entitled to possession of the lands conditional on payment of the additional rent due for the period they had been out of possession.
That condition having been fulfilled (by adjustment of the appellant 's claim against the mesne profits), the decree must be held to have been satisfied, thus completely settling the cross demands.
The landlord 's demand for subsequent rents has to be enforced in the ordinary way in the civil court if any default has been committed in the payment of these rents.
This claim cannot for ever remain linked with the demand for mesne profits for any anterior period.
The result is that the decision of the High Court on this point is maintained.
On the question of future interest payable on the decretal amount, the learned District Judge observed as follows : ""I may state, however, at this stage that if I were to rule out the fact that I am allowing the claim of the appel lant for equitable set off, I would have allowed interest to the plaintiffs at the uniform rate of 4 per cent.
per annum throughout, i.e., from the beginning of the Washilat period up to date.
As I am allowing the prayer for equitable set off, I am of opinion, however, that interest at the usual rate at 6 per cent.
per annum should be granted for the whole of this period.
"" The High Court disallowed equitable set off but yet maintained this decision.
When the claim for equitable set off is being disallowed, there is no justification for allowing future interest at the rate of more than four per cent.
for such a long period, particularly in a case where the plaintiff himself has not been prompt in getting, the amount of mesne profits ascertained.
The plaintiff did not even ask for an enquiry into this question for a period of about twelve years.
Taking into consideration all the circumstances of the case we think that future interest should not have been allowed to the plaintiff in the several suits at a higher rate than four per cent.
on the amount decreed in the various Suits by way of mesne profits.
793 The appellant 's last contention that the munafa (rent) should not be calculated on the principle laid down in Radhacharan vs Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1) but should have been assessed on a fair share of the profits of the land has no substance because the claim was not made in the grounds of appeal to the Privy Council and was not even mentioned in the additional grounds of appeal.
It was for the first time made before us at the hearing and we see no valid grounds for entertaining it at this late stage.
Moreover, it seems to us that the claim has no substance in the absence of any evidence about the proportion the original patni rent bore to the revenue and cesses.
For the reasons given above all these appeals fail except to the extent that the decree of the High Court is modified in that the amounts decreed by way of mesne profits in the various suits will bear interest at the rate of four per cent.
instead of six per cent.
The parties will bear their own costs in all these appeals.

","Where a patnidar has obtained a decree against his zemindar for possession of resumed chaukidari chakran lands with mesne profits from the date on which the zemindar wrongfully took 783 possession of them, the zemindar is not entitled to deduct by way of equitable set off from the amount of mesne profits payable by him under the decree, the amounts due to him on account of rent, revenue and cesses for a period subsequent to the date of delivery of possession of the lands inasmuch as the two cross demands do not arise out of the same trans action.
The transaction which led to the plaintiff 's demand for mesne profits resulted from the defendant 's wrongful act as trespasser, while the transaction which gave rise to the zemindar 's demand arose out of the relationship of landlord and tenant and the obligations resulting therefrom.

Appeal from a judgment dated 18th May, 1948, of the High Court of East Punjab at Simla (Khosla and Teja Singh JJ.) in Letters Patent Appeal No. 189 of 1946 arising out of the judgment dated 11 th February, 1946, of the Senior Subordinate Judge, Ambala.
The facts are set out in the judgment.
Gopinath Kunzru (B.C. Misra, with him) for the appel lants.
Rang Behari Lal (N.C. Sen, with him) for the respond ents.
March 7.
The judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
This appeal is on behalf of the judgment debtor in a proceeding for execution of a money decree and it is directed against the judgment of a Letters Patent Bench of the Punjab High Court dated 18th of May, 1949.
by which the learned Judges 546 affirmed, in appeal, a decision of a single Judge of that court dated 29th October, 1946.
The original order against which the appeal was taken to the High Court was made by the Senior Subordinate Judge, Ambala, in Execution Case No. 18 of 1945 dismissing the objections preferred by the appel lants under section 47 of the Civil Procedure Code.
To appreciate the contentions that have been raised in this appeal, it would be necessary to give a short narrative of the material events in their chronological order.
On September 30, 1925, Baldev Das, the father of the appel lants, who was, at that time the manager of a joint Hindu family, consisting of himself and his sons, executed a mortgage bond in favour of Mst.
Naraini, the original re spondent No. 1, and another person named Talok Chand, by which certain movable properties belonging to the joint family were hypothecated to secure a loan of Rs 16,000.
On April 16, 1928, the appellants along with a minor brother of theirs named Sumer Chand filed a suit: being Suit No. 23 of 1928 in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Shahjahanpur against their father Baldev Das for partition of the joint family properties.
The suit culminated in a final decree for partition on 20th July, 1928, and the joint family properties were divided by metes and bounds and separate possession was taken by the father and the sons.
On 29th September, 1934, Mst.
Naraini filed a suit in the Court of the Senior Subordinate Judge, Ambala, against Baldev Das for recovery of a sum of Rs. 12;500 only on the basis of the mortgage bond referred to above.
It was stated in the plaint that the money was borrowed by the defendant as manager of a joint Hindu family and the plaintiff prayed for a decree against the mortgaged property as well as against the joint family.
On 18th December, 1934, the appellants made an application before the Subordinate Judge under Order I, Rule 10, and Order XXXIV, Rule 1, Civil Procedure Code, praying that they might be added as parties defendants to the suit and the points in issue arising therein might be decided in their presence.
It was asserted in the 547 petition that Baldev Das was not the manager of a joint family and that the family properties had been partitioned by a decree of the court, as a result of which the proper ties alleged to be the subject matter of the mortgage were allotted to the share of the petitioners.
In reply to this petition, the plaintiff 's counsel stated in court on 7th February, 1935, that his client would give up the claim for a mortgage decree against the properties in suit and would be satisfied only with a money decree against Baldev Das personally.
The plaint was amended accordingly, deleting all reference to the joint family and abandoning the claim against the mortgaged property.
Upon this the appellants withdrew their application for being made parties to the suit and reserved their right to take proper legal action if and when necessary.
On April 17, 1935, Baldev Das died and on 2nd September following the appellants as well as their mother, who figures as respondent No. 5 in this appeal, were brought on the record as legal representatives of Baldev Das.
On October 9, 1935, the appellants filed a written statement in which a number of pleas were taken in answer to the plaintiff 's claim and it was asserted in paragraph 10 of the written statement that Baldev Das dealt Badri or specu lative transactions, and if any money was due to the plain tiff at all in connection with such transactions the debt was illegal and immoral and not binding on the family property.
On the same day the court recorded an order to the effect that as the plaintiff had given up her claim for a mortgage decree, the legal representatives of the deceased could not be allowed to raise pleas relating to the validity or otherwise of the mortgage.
On 20th November, 1935, the parties arrived at a compromise and on the basis of the same, a simple money decree was passed in favour of the plaintiff for the full amount claimed in the suit together with half costs amounting to Rs. 425 annas odd against the estates of Baldev Das in the hands of his legal representa tives.
After certain attempts at execution of this decree which did not prove successful, 548 the present application for execution was flied by the decree holder on March 13, 1945, in the court of the Senior Subordinate Judge, Ambala, and in accordance with the prayer contained therein, the court directed the attachment of certain immovable properties consisting of a number of shops in possession of the appellants and situated at a place called Abdullaput.
On April 23, 1945, the appellants filed objections under section 47, Civil Procedure Code, and they opposed the attachment of the properties substantially on the ground that those properties did not belong to Baldev Das but were the separate and exclusive properties of the objectors which they obtained on partition with their father long before the decree was passed.
It was asserted that these properties could not be made liable for the satisfac tion of the decretal dues which had to be realised under the terms of the decree itself from the estate left by Baldev Das.
After hearing the parties and the evidence adduced by them the Subordinate Judge came to the conclusion that there was in fact a partition between Baldev Das and his sons in the year 1928 and as a result of the same, the properties, which were attached at the instance of the decree holder, were allotted to the share of the sons.
The decree sought to be executed was obtained after the partition, but it was in respect of a debt which was contracted by the father prior to it.
It was held in these circumstances that the separate share of the sons which they obtained on partition was liable under the Hindu law for the pre partition debt of their father if it was not immoral and under section 53 of the Civil Procedure Code the decreeholder was entitled to execute the decree against such properties.
As no point was raised by the objectors in their petition alleging that the debt covered by the decree was tainted with immorality, the objections under section 47, Civil Procedure Code, were dismissed.
The objectors thereupon took an appeal to the High Court of East Punjab which was heard by Rahman J. sitting singly.
The learned judge dismissed the appeal and affirmed the decision of the Subordinate 549 Judge.
A further appeal taken to a Division Bench under the Letters Patent was also dismissed and it is the propriety of the judgment of the Letters Patent Bench that has been challenged before us in this appeal.
Mr. Kunzru appearing for the appellants put forward a three fold contention in support of the appeal.
He contended in the first place that under the terms of the compromise decree the decreeholder could proceed only against the properties of Baldev Das in the hands of his legal represen tatives and no property belonging to the appellants could be made liable for the satisfaction of the decree.
The second contention put forward is that as the decree in the present case was obtained after partition of the joint family property between the father and his sons, the separate property of the sons obtained on partition was not liable under Hindu law for the debt of the father.
It is urged last of all that in any event if there was any pious obligation on the part of the sons to pay the father 's debt incurred before partition, such obligation could be enforced against the sons, only in a properly constituted suit and not by way of execution of a decree obtained in a suit which was brought against the father alone during his lifetime and to which the sons were made parties only as legal representa tives after the father 's death.
As regards the first point, the determination of the question raised by Mr. Kunzru depends upon the construction to be put upon the terms of the compromise decree.
The operative portion of the decree as drawn up by the court stands as follows: ""It is ordered that the parties having compromised, a decree in accordance with the terms of the compromise be and the same is hereby passed in favour of the plaintiff against the estate of Baldev Das deceased in possession of his legal representatives.
It is also ordered that the defendants do also pay Rs. 425 7 0, half costs of the suit.
"" 71 550 There was no petition of compromise filed by the parties and made part of the decree, but there are on the record two statements, one made by Pannalal, the appellant No. 1, on behalf of himself and his mother, and the other by Lala Haraprasad, the special agent of the plaintiff, setting out terms of the compromise.
The terms are worded much in the same manner as in the decree itself and are to the effect that a decree for the amount in suit together with half costs would be awarded against the property of Baldev Das deceased.
It is argued by Mr. Kunzru that the expression ""estate of Baldev Das deceased"" occurring in the decree must mean and refer to the property belonging to Baldev Das at the date of his death and could not include any property which the sons obtained on partition with their father during the father 's lifetime and in respect of which the latter possessed no interest at the time of his death.
Stress is laid by the learned counsel in this connection on the fact that when the appellants were brought on the record as legal representatives of their deceased father in the mortgage suit, they specifically asserted in their written statement that there was a partition between them and their father long before the date of the suit as a result of which the hypothecated properties were allotted to them.
Upon that the plaintiff definitely abandoned her claim to a mortgage decree or to any relief against the joint family and agreed finally to have a money decree executable against the personal assets of Baldev Das in the hands of his heirs.
In these circumstances, it is urged that if it was the intention of the parties that the decreeholder would be entitled to proceed against the separate property of the sons nothing could have been easier than to insert a provi sion to that effect in the compromise decree.
There is undoubtedly apparent force in this contention but there is another aspect of the question which requires consideration.
The terms of the decree that was passed in this suit, though based on the consent of the parties, are precisely the same as are contemplated by section 52 (1) of the Civil procedure Code.
It was a decree for money 551 passed against the legal representatives of a deceased debtor and it provided expressly that the decretal amount was to be realised out of the estate of the deceased in the hands of the legal representatives.
It is argued on behalf of the respondent, and we think rightly, that as the decree fulfils the conditions of section 52 (1) of the Civil Proce dure Code, it would attract all the incidents which attach by law to a decree of that character.
Consequently the decreeholder would be entitled to call in aid the provision of section 53 of the Code; and if any property in the hands of the sons, other than what they received by inheritance from their father, is liable under the Hindu law to pay the father 's debts, such property could be reached by the de creeholder in execution of the decree by virtue of the provision of section 53 of the Civil Procedure Code.
Wheth er the property which the sons obtained on partition during the lifetime of the father is liable for a debt covered by a decree passed after partition and whether section 53 has at all any application to a case of this character are ques tions which we have to determine in connection with the second and the third points raised by appellants.
Section 53, Civil Procedure Code, it is admitted, being only a rule of procedure, cannot create or take away any substantive right.
It is only when the liability of the sons to pay the debts of their father in certain circumstances exists under the Hindu law, is the operation of the section attracted and not otherwise.
The only other question that can possibly arise by reason of the decree being a compromise decree is, whether the parties themselves have, by agreement, excluded the operation of section 53, Civil Procedure Code.
It is certainly possible for the parties to agree among themselves that the decree should be executed only against a particular property and no other, but when any statutory right is sought to be contracted out, it is necessary that express words of exclusion must be usedl.
Exclusion cannot be in ferred merely from the fact that the compromise made no reference to such right.
As nothing was said in the compro mise decree in the present case about the 552 right of the decreeholder to avail herself of other provi sions of the Code which might be available to her in law, we cannot say that the plaintiff has by agreement expressly given up those rights.
The first point, therefore, by itself is of no assistance to the appellants.
We now come to the other two points raised by Mr. Kunzru and as they are inter connected they can conveniently be taken up together.
These points involve consideration of the somewhat vexed question relating to the liability of a son under the Hindu law other than that of the Daybhag school to pay the debts of his father, provided they are not tainted with immorality.
In the opinion of the Hindu Smriti writers, debt is not merely a legal obligation, but non payment of debt is a sin, the consequences of which follow the debtor even after his death.
A text (1), which is attributed to Brihaspathi, lays down: ""He who having received a sum lent or the like does not repay it to the owner, will be born hereafter in the credi tor 's house a slave, a servant, a woman or a quadruped.
"" There are other texts which say that a person m debt goes to hell.
Hindu law givers therefore imposed a pious duty on the descendants of a man including his son, grandson and great grandson to pay off the debts of their ancestor and relieve him of the after death torments consequent on non payment.
In the original texts a difference has been made in regard to the obligation resting upon sons, grand sons and great grandsons in this respect.
The son is bound to discharge the ancestral debt as if it was his own, to gether with interest and irrespective of any assets that he might have received.
The liability of the grandson is much the same except that he has not to pay any interest; but in regard to the great grandson the liability arises only if he received assets from his ancestor.
It is now settled by judicial decisions that there is no difference as between son, grandson and great grandson so far as the obligation to pay the debts of the ancestor is concerned; but none of them has any personal (1) Vide Colebrooke 's Digest I, 228, 553 liability in the matter irrespective of receiving any assets (1).
The position, therefore, is that the son is not person ally liable for the debt of his father even if the debt was not incurred for an immoral purpose and the obligation is limited to the assets received by him in his share of the joint family property or to his interest in such property and it does not attach to his self acquisitions.
The duty being religious or moral, it ceases to exist if the debt is tainted with immorality or vice.
According to the text writers, this obligation arises normally on the death of the father; but even during the father 's lifetime the son is obliged to pay his father 's debts in certain exceptional circumstances, e.g., when the father is afflicted with disease or has become insane or too old or has been away from his country for a long time or has suffered civil death by becoming an anchorite (2).
It can now be taken to be fairly well settled that the pious liability of the son to pay the debts of his father exists whether the father 1s alive or dead (3).
Thus it is open to the father during his lifetime, to effect a transfer of any joint family property including the interests of his sons m the same to pay off an antecedent debt not incurred for family necessity or bene fit, provided it is not tainted with immorality.
It is equally open to the creditor to obtain a decree against the father and in execution of the same put up to sale not merely the father 's but also the son 's interest in the joint estate.
The creditor can make the sons parties to such suit and obtain an adjudication from the court that the debt was a proper debt payable by the sons.
But even if the sons are not made parties, they cannot resist the sale unless they succeed in establishing that the debts were contracted for immoral purposes.
These propositions can be said to be well recognised and reasonably beyond the region of controversy(4).
All of them, however, (1) Vide Masitullah vs Damodar Prasad, 53 I.A. 204.
(2) Vide Mayne 's Hindu Law, 11th edition, p. 408.
(3) Vide Brij Narain vs Mangla Prasad, 51 I.A. 129.
(4) Vide Girdharee Lall vs Kantoo Lall, 1 I.A. 321; Maddan Thakoor vs Kantoo Lall, 1 I.A, 333; Suraj Bunsi vs Sheo Prasad, 6 I.A.88; Brij Narain vs Mangla Prosad, 51 I.A. 129.
554 have reference to the period when the estate remains joint and there is existence of coparcenership between the father and the son.
There is no question that so long as the family remains undivided the father is entitled to alienate, for satisfying his own personal debts not tainted with immorality, the whole of the ancestral estate.
A creditor is also entitled to proceed against the entire estate for recovery of a debt taken by the father.
The position is somewhat altered when there is a disruption of the joint family by a partition between the father and the sons.
The question then arises, whether the sons remain liable for the debt of the father even after the family is divided; and can the creditor proceed against the shares that the sons obtain on partition for realization of his dues either by way of a suit or in execution of a decree obtained against the father alone ? It must be admitted that the law on the subject as developed by judicial decisions has not been always consist ent or uniform and the pronouncements of some of the Judges betray a lack of agreement in their approach to the various questions involved in working out the law.
As regards debts contracted by the father after parti tion, there is no dispute that the sons are not liable for such debts.
The share which the father receives on partition and which after his death comes to his sons, may certainly, at the hands of the latter, be available to the creditors of the father, but the shares allotted on partition to the sons can never be made liable for the post partition debts of the father (1).
The question that is material for our present purpose is, whether the sons can be made liable for an unsecured debt of the father incurred before partition, in respect to which the creditor filed his suit and obtained decree after the partition took place.
On this point admit tedly there is divergence of judicial opinion, though the majority of decided cases are in favour of the view that the separated share of a son remains liable even after partition for the pre partition debts of the father which (1) Vide Mayne 's Hindu Law, 11th Edition, 430.
555 are not illegal or immoral (1).
The reasons given in support of this view by different Judges are not the same and on the other side there are pronouncements of certain learned Judges, though few in number, expressing the view that once a partition takes place, the obligation of the sons to discharge the debts of their father comes to an end(2).
The minority view proceeds upon the footing that the pious obligation of the son is only to his father and corre sponding to this obligation of the son the father has a right to alienate the entire joint property including the son 's interest therein for satisfaction of an antecedent debt not contracted for immoral purposes.
What the creditor can do is to avail himself of this right of the father and work it out either by suit or execution proceedings; in other words, the remedy of a father 's simple contract credi tor during the father 's lifetime rests entirely on the right of the father himself to alienate the entire family property for satisfaction of his personal debts.
The father loses this right as soon as partition takes place and after that, the creditor cannot occupy a better position or be allowed to assert rights which the father himself could not possess.
The reasoning in support of the other view which has been accepted in the majority of the decided cases is thus expressed by Waller J. in his judgment in the Madras Full Bench case(3): ""On principle, I can see no reason why a partition should exempt a son 's share from liability for a pre parti tion debt for which it was liable before partition.
The creditor advances money to the father on the credit of the joint family property.
Why should he be deprived of all but a fraction of his security by a transaction to which he was not a party and of which he (1) Vide Subramanya vs Sabapathi, ; Anna bat vs Shivappa, ; Jawahar Singh vs parduman, 14 Lab. 399; Atul Krishna vs Lala Nandanji.

556 was not aware ? and what becomes of the son 's pious obliga tion ? It was binding as regards the particular debt before partition; does it cease to apply to that debt simply be cause there has been a partition ?"" The first part of the observation of the learned Judge does not impress us very much.
An unsecured creditor, who has lent money to the father, does not acquire any lien or charge over the family property, and no question of his security being diminished, at all arises.
In spite of his having borrowed money the father remains entitled to alien ate the property and a mere expectation of the creditor however reasonable it may be, cannot be guaranteed by law so long as he does not take steps necessary in law to give him adequate protection.
The extent of the pious obligation referred to in the latter part of the observation of the learned Judge certainly requires careful consideration.
We do not think that it is quite correct to say that the credi tor 's claim is based entirely upon the father 's power of dealing with the son 's interest in the joint estate.
The father 's right of alienating the family property for payment of his just debts may be one of the consequences of the pious obligation which the Hindu law imposes upon the sons or one of the means of enforcing it, but it is certainly not the measure of the entire obligation.
As we have said already, according to the strict Hindu theory, the obliga tion of the sons to pay the father 's debts normally arises when the father is dead, disabled or unheard of for a long time.
No question of alienation of the family property by the father arises in these events, although it is precisely under these circumstances that the son is obliged to dis charge the debts of his father.
As was said by Sulaiman A.C.J. in the case of Bankey Lal vs Durga Prasad(1): ""The Hindu law texts based the liability on the pious obligation itself and not on the father 's power to sell the son 's share.
"" It is thus necessary to see what exactly is the extent of the obligation which is recognised by the Hindu (1) (9931) 53 All. 868 at 876 (F.B.).
557 texts writers in regard to the payment by the son c the pre partition debts of his father.
Almost all the relevant texts on this point are to be found collected in the judg ments of Sulaiman A.C.J. and Mukherji J in the Allahabad Full Bench case referred to above A text of Narada recites(1): ""What is left after the discharge of the father obliga tion and after the payment of the father 's debts shall be divided by the brothers so that the father, may not remain a debtor.
"" Katyan also says(2): ""The sons shall pay off the debts and the gift,, prom ised by the father and divide the remaining among them selves.
"" There is a further passage in Manu(3): ""After due division of the paternal estate if any debt or estate of the father be found out let the brother equally divide the same among themselves."" According to Yagnavalka(4): ""The sons should divide the wealth and the debts equal lyl.
"" It is true that the partition contemplated in these passages is one after the death of the father.
but when ever the partition might take place, the view of the Hindu law givers undoubtedly is that the binding debts on the family property would have to be satisfied or provided for before the coparceners can divide the property.
In Sat Narain vs Das (5), the Judicial Committee pointed out that when the family estate is divided, it is necessary to take account of both the assets and the debts for which the undivided estate is liable.
It was argued in that case on behalf of the appellants that the pious obligation of the sons was an obligation not to object to the alienation of the joint estate by the (1) Narada., 13, 32.

(5) (1936) 63 I.A. 384 72 558 father for his antecedent debt unless they were immoral or illegal, but these debts were not a liability on the joint estate for which provision was required to be made before partition.
This contention did not find favour with the Judicial Committee and in their opinion, as they expressed in the judgment, the right thing to do was to make provision for discharge of such liability when there was partition of the joint estate.
If there is no such provision, ""the debts are to be paid severally by all the sons according to their shares of inheritance,"" as enjoined by Vishnu(1).
In our opinion, this is the proper view to take regarding the liability of the sons under Hindu law for the pre partition debts of the father.
The sons are liable to pay these debts even after partition unless there was an arrangement for payment of these debts at the time when the partition took place.
This is substantially the view taken by the Allahabad High Court in the Full Bench case referred to above and it seems to us to be perfectly in accord with the princi ples of equity and justice.
The question now comes as to what is meant by an ar rangement for payment of debts.
The expressions ""bona fide"" and ""mala fide"" partition seem to have been frequently used in this connection in various decided cases.
The use of such expressions far from being useful does not unoften lead to error and confusion.
If by mala fide partition is meant a partition the object of which is to delay and defeat the creditors who have claims upon the joint family property, obviously this would be a fraudulent transaction not binding in law and it would be open to the creditors to avoid it by appropriate means.
So also a mere colourable partition not meant to operate between the parties can be ignored and the creditor can enforce his remedies as if the parties still continued to be joint.
But a partition need not be mala fide in the sense that the dominant intention of the parties was to defeat the claims of the creditors; if it makes no ar rangement or provision for the payment of the just debts payable (1) Vishnu, Chap.
6, verse 36.
559 out of the joint family property, the liability of the sons for payment of the pre partition debts of the father will still remain.
We desire only to point out that an arrange ment for payment of debts does not necessarily imply that a separate fund should be set apart for payment of these debts before the net assets are divided, or that some additional property must be given to the father over and above his legitimate share sufficient to meet the demands of his creditors.
Whether there is a proper arrangement for payment of the debts or not, would have to be decided on the facts and circumstances of each individual case.
We can conceive of cases where the property allotted to the father in his own legitimate share was considered more than enough for his own necessities and he undertook to pay off all his personal debts and release the sons from their obligation in respect thereof.
That may also be considered to be a proper ar rangement for payment of the creditor in the circumstances of a particular case.
After all the primary liability to pay his debts is upon the father himself and the sons should not be made liable if the property in the hands of the father is more than adequate for the purpose.
If the arrangement made at the time of partition is reasonable and proper, an unse cured creditor cannot have any reason to complain.
The fact that he is no party to such arrangement is, in our opinion, immaterial.
Of course, if the transaction is fraudulent or is not meant to be operative, it could be ignored or set aside; but otherwise it is the duty of unsecured creditor to be on his guard lest any family property over which he has no charge or lien is diminished for purposes of realization of his dues.
Thus, in our opinion, a son is liable, even after partition for the pre partition debts of his father which are not immoral or illegal and for the payment of which no arrangement was made at the date of the partition.
The question now is, how is this liability to be enforced by the creditor, either during the lifetime of the lather or after his death ? It has been held 560 in a large number of cases(1) all of which recognise the liability of the son to pay the pre partition debts of the father that a decree against the father alone obtained after partition in respect of such debt cannot be executed against the property that is allotted to the son on partition.
They concur in holding that a separate and independent suit must be instituted against the sons before their shares can be reached.
The principles underlying these decisions seems to us to be quite sound.
After a partition takes place, the father can no longer represent the family and a decree obtained against him alone, cannot be binding on the sepa rated sons.
In the second place, the power exercisable by the father of selling the interests of the sons for satis faction of his personal debts comes to an end with parti tion.
As the separated share of the sons cannot be said to belong to the father nor has he any disposing power over it or its profits which he can exercise for his benefit, the provision of section 60 of the Civil Procedure Code would operate as a bar to the attachment and sale of any such property in execution of a decree against the father.
The position has been correctly stated by the Nagpur High Court(2) in the following passages: ""To say a son is under a pious obligation to pay cer tain debts is one thing; to say his property can be taken in execution is another.
In our view, property can only be attached and sold in execution if it falls within the kind of property that can be attached and sold.
What that is, is found by looking at section 60.
When one looks at section 60 one finds that the property in question should either belong to the judgment debtor or he should have a disposing power over it.
After partition, the share that goes to the son does not belong to the father and the father has no dispos ing power over it.
Therefore such property does not fall within section. . .
It by no means follows that a son cannot (1) Vide Kameswaramma vs Venkatasubba, 20; Subramanya vs Sabapathi, ; Thirumala Muthu vs Subramania, A.I.R. 1937 Mad. 458; Surajmal vs Motiram ; Atul Krishna vs Lala Nandan","B, acting as manager of a joint Hindu family, consisting of himself and his sons executed a mortgage deed in favour of the plaintiff, hypothecating certain movables to secure a loan.
Subsequently the sons obtained a partition decree against their father and the joint family properties were divided by metes and bounds and separate possession was taken by the father and the sons.
Later on, the plaintiff filed a suit against 'B praying for a decree against the mortgaged property as well as against the joint family.
The sons applied for being impleaded as defend ants stating that the mortgaged properties were allotted to them by the parti tion decree and B was not the manager of a joint Hindu family.
In reply the plaintiff gave up the claim for a mortgage decree stating that she would be statisfied with a money decree against B and the plaint was amended according ly B died and his sons were brought on the record as his legal representatives.
The sons pleaded, inter alia, that the debt was illegal and immoral as it related to specula tive transactions by the father.
The parties arrived at a compromise and on the basis thereof a simple money decree was passed in favour of the plaintiff against the estate of B in the hands of his legal representatives.
The judgment debtors (sons) disputed their liability on three grounds, viz., (i) that under the terms of the compromise decree, the decree holder could proceed only against the properties of B in the hands of his legal representatives and no property belonging to the sons could be made liable for the decree;(ii) that, as the decree was obtained after partition of the joint family properties between the father and his sons, the properties of the sons obtained in partition were not liable under Hindu law for the debt of the father, (iii) that in any event if there was any pious obligation on the part of the sons to pay the father 's debt incurred before partition such obligation could be enforced against the sons only in a properly constituted suit and not by way of execu tion of a decree obtained in a suit which was brought against the father alone during his lifetime and to which the sons were made parties as legal representatives after the father 's death: 545 Held, (repelling the contentions), (1) that as the decree fulfilled the conditions of sec.
52 (1) of the Civil Procedure Code it attracted all the incidents which attach by law to a decree of that character 'and therefore the decree holder was entitled to call in aid the provisions of sec.
53 of the Code and if any property in the hands of the sons was liable under the Hindu law to pay the father 's debt, such property would be liable in execution of the decree by virtue of the provision of sec.
53 of the Civil Procedure Code; (2) that a son is liable even after parti tion for the pre partition debts of his father, which are not immoral or illegal and for the payment of which no arrangement was made at the time of the partition; (3) that a decree passed against the separated sons as legal repre sentatives of the deceased father in respect of a debt incurred before partition can be executed against the shares obtained by such sons at the partition and this can be done in execution proceedings and it is not necessary to bring a separate suit for the purpose.
[Case was remanded to the execution court to determine the question whether the debt was immoral or illegal and whether any arrangement was made at the time of partition for the payment of the debt.] Bankey Lal vs Durga Prosad (I.L.R. 53 All. 868 F.B.) approved.

Appeal from a judgment and order of the 1st April, 1949, of the High Court of Judicature, Madras (Rajamannar C.J. and Balakrishna Aiyar J.) in Civil Miscellaneous Peti tion No. 1317 of 1949 arising out of Order dated 29th Janu ary, 1949, of the Commissioner of Labour, Madras.
S.C. Isaacs (section N. Mukherjee, with him), for the appel lant.
The respondent was not represented.
April 10.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
This appeal is directed against a judgment of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated 1st April, 1949, passed in a certiorari proceeding, by which the learned Judges directed the issue of a writ of certiorari for quashing a portion of an order made by the Labour Com missioner, Madras, in any enquiry under section 51 of the Madras Shops and Establishments Act.
520 The facts material for our present purpose lie within a narrow compass and to appreciate the point that requires consideration in this appeal it will be convenient first of all to advert to a few relevant provisions of the Madras Act referred to above.
The Act was passed in 1947 and its ob ject, as stated in the preamble, is to provide for the regulation of conditions of work in shops and other estab lishments.
Section 14(1) of the Act sets a statutory limi tation upon the working hours and lays down: ""Subject to the other provisions of the Act, no person employed in any establishment shall be required or allowed to work for more than 8 hours in any day and 48 hours in any week.
"" A proviso attached to the sub section which by way of exception to the rule enunciated therein, allows employment of a person in any establishment for any period in excess of this statutory limit subject to payment of overtime wages, provided the period of work including overtime work does not exceed 10 hours any day, and in the aggregate 54 hours in any week.
Section 31 provides: ""Where any person employed in any establishment is re quired to work overtime, he shall be entitled, in respect of such overtime work, to wages at twice the rate of ordinary rate of wages.
"" Section 50 preserves the existing rights and privileges of an employee in any establishment if these rights and privileges are more favourable to him than those created by the Act.
The section runs as follows : ""Nothing contained in this Act shall affect any rights or privileges which any person employed in any establishment is entitled to on the date on which this Act comes into operation in respect of such establishment under any other law, contract, custom.
Or Usage applicable to such estab lishment if such rights and privileges are more favourable to him than those to which he would be entitled under this Act.
"" 521 The only other relevant section is section 51 which says : ""If any question arises whether all or any of the provi sions of this Act apply to an establishment or to a person employed thereto or whether section 50 applies to any case or not, it shall be decided by the Commissioner of Labour and his decision thereon shall be final and shall not be liable to be questioned in a court of law"".
The appellant is a limited company carrying on business in Madras, while the respondent is an association of cleri cal employees including those working under the appellant.
On November 10, 1948, the respondent presented an applica tion before the Labour Commissioner, Madras, under section 51 of the Shops and Establishments Act for decision of certain questions referred to in the petition which related to the rights and privileges of the employees of the appel lant.
The Commissioner issued a notice calling upon the appellant to appear and answer the contentions raised on behalf of the employees.
The parties appeared before the Commissioner on 26th November, 1948, and again on 16th December following when they were represented by lawyers.
After hearing the parties and on a consideration of the evidence adduced by them, the Labour Commissioner made his decision on 29th January, 1949.
The questions raised by the employees were classified by the Commissioner under six separate issues and two of them, which are material for our present purpose, are worded as follows : Issue No. 5.
Whether there has been an increase in working hours from 6 to 61/2 on week days from 12th October, 1948, and the increase is permissible ? Issue No. 6.
Whether overtime wages at twice the ordi nary rates should not be paid for work done by the employees after the normal working hours ? On Issue No. 5.
the 'decision of the Commissioner was that the 'business hours of the company were six and half prior to 1st April, 1948 ', when the Act came into force and they continue to be so even now.
It is 522 true that a circular ' was issued which was to take effect from 12th October, 1948, under which the lunch interval was reduced by half an hour, but at the same time it was direct ed that the office would close for business with the general public at 5 P.M. instead of 5 30 P.M.
On all working days so far as business hours are concerned.
As regards Issue No. 6 the Labour Commissioner observes first of all that although it is customary in many estab lishments to fix certain hours of business during which business is transacted with the outside public, yet they are not the 'real hours of employment and as a matter of fact the employees do work outside these business hours, for which they are not entitled to any extra remuneration pro vided.
the statutory limit of 8 hours a day is not exceeded.
In the opinion of the Commissioner if the normal hours of work were previously fixed and strictly adhered to, the employees could have acquired a right or privilege to work only for such hours and they would be entitled to seek protection under section 50 of the Act against the imposi tion of longer hours without a corresponding increase in emoluments.
The Commissioner goes on to say that in such cases it would be sufficient if compensatory wages are paid at the ordinary rate calculated according to rule 10 of the Madras Shops and Establishments Rules for work in excess of the normal hours but less than the statutory hours.
But for work of more than 8 hours a day or 48 hours a week, wages at twice the ordinary rates should be paid as required by the proviso to section 14 (1) and section 31 of the Act.
The conclusion reached by the Commissioner with regard to this issue is expressed by him in the following words: ""I hold that the case of Messrs. Parry and Company 's employees falls under the former category and that the employees in this company will be entitled to overtime wages only when the statutory hours are exceeded.
"" This order, as said above, was made on 29th January, 1949, and on 16th of February following the 523 respondent association filed a petition before the High Court at Madras, praying for a writ of certiorari to quash the same.
This application was heard by a Bench of two Judges and by the judgment dated 1st of April, 1949, the learned Judges allowed the petition in part and quashed the order of the Labour Commissioner in so far as it decided that the employees of the appellant will be entitled to overtime wages only when the statutory hours were exceeded.
It is the/propriety of this decision that has been chal lenged before us in this appeal.
It is somewhat unfortunate that the respondent remained unrepresented before us and the appeal had to be heard ex parte.
Mr. Isaacs, who appeared on behalf of the appellant, has, however, rendered every assistance that he possibly could and has placed before us all the material facts and relevant provisions of law.
Having given the matter our best consideration, we are of the opinion that the order of the High Court cannot be supported and that this appeal should be allowed.
The High Court seems to have based its decision on the ground that the Commissioner of Labour ' failed to answer the question raised by the association as to whether the company was entitled to require the employees to work more than six and half hours a day.
According to the learned Judge, the Labour Commissioner was not right in holding that even if the working hours were fixed at six and half hours a day, the employees would be entitled to overtime wages only when the statutory hours are exceeded.
As has been pointed out already, the Labour Commission er did decide that if the normal hours of work were previ ously fixed and rigidly adhered to, the employees would be entitled to seek protection under Section 50 of the Act against imposition of longer hours of ,work without a corre sponding increase in their emoluments.
The increase in such cases, according to the Labour Commissioner, should be on the scale of compensatory wages allowed under rule 10 of 524 the Madras Shops and Establishments Rules.
If, however, the increase is more than the statutory period, ""the employees will be entitled to wages at double rate under Section 31 of,the Act.
This decision may or may not be right, but it has not been and cannot be suggested that the Labour Commis sioner acted without jurisdiction or in excess of his pow ers.
Under Section 51 of the Madras Shops and Establish ments Act, the Labour Commissioner is the only proper and competent authority to determine the questions referred to it in that section; and there is an express provision in it that the decision of the Labour Commissioner shall be final and not liable to be challenged in any court of/law.
It was the respondent who took the matter before the Labour Commis sioner in the present case and invited his decision upon the questions raised in the petition.
The Commissioner was certainly bound to decide the questions and he did decide them.
At the worst, he may have come to an erroneous conclu sion, but the conclusion is in respect of a matter which lies entirely within the jurisdiction of the Labour Commis sioner to decide and it does not relate to anything collat eral, an erroneous decision upon which might affect his jurisdiction.
The records of the case do not disclose any error apparent on the face of the proceeding or any irregu larity in the procedure adopted by the Labour Commissioner which goes contrary to the principles of natural justice.
Thus there was absolutely no grounds here which would justi fy a superior court in issuing a writ of certiorari for removal of an order or proceeding of an inferior tribunal vested with powers to exercise judicial or quasi judicial functions.
What the High Court has done really is to exer cise the powers of an appellate court and correct what it considered to be an error in the decision of the Labour Commissioner.
This obviously it cannot do.
The position might have been different if the Labour Commissioner had omitted to decide a matter which he was bound to decide and in such cases a mandamus might legitimately issue commanding the authority to determine questions which it left 525 undecided(1); but no certiorari is available to quash a decision passed with jurisdiction by an inferior tribunal on the mere ground that such decision is erroneous.
The judg ment of the High Court, therefore, in our opinion, is plain ly unsustainable.
In the view which we have taken, it is unnecessary to express any opinion as to whether certiorari has been taken away if it can be taken away at all under our Constitution by the provision of section 51 of the Madras Shops and Establishments Act which lays down that the decision of the Labour Commissioner would be final and incapable of being challenged in any court of law.
It was conceded by Mr. Isaacs that in spite of such statutory provisions the superior court is not absolutely deprived of the power to issue a writ, although it can do so only on the ground of either a manifest defect of jurisdiction in the tribunal that made the order or of a manifest fraud in the party procuring it(2).
The result is, that in our opinion the appeal succeeds and the judgment of the High Court is set aside and the order of the Labour Commissioner affirmed.
As the respondent was absent, we do not think it proper, in the circumstances of this case, to make any order for costs.
(1) Vide Board of Education vs Rice and others, [1911] A.C. 179.
(2) Vide Colonial Bank of Australasia vs Robert Willan, 5P.C. Ap, peals 417.
","The High Court cannot issue a writ of certiorari to quash a decision passed with jurisdiction by a Labour Com missioner under the Madras Shops and Establishments Act, 1947, an the mere ground that such decision is erroneous.
Under section 51 of the Madras Shops and Establishments Act, 1947, the Labour Commissioner is the only proper and compe tent authority to.determine the questions referred to him under that section and the decision of the Labour Commis sioner is final and not liable to be challenged in a Court of law.

Appeal under articles 132(1) and 134(1)(c) of the Constitu tion of India against the Judgment and Order dated 28th February, 1951, of the High Court of Saurashtra at Rajkot (Shah C.J. and Chhatpar J.) in Criminal Appeal No. 162 of 1950, The material facts appear in the Judgment.

February 27.
The following Judgments were delivered.
PATANJALI SASTRI C.J.
This appeal raises questions under article 14 of the Constitution more or less similar to those dealt with by this Court in Criminal Appeal No. 297 of 1951, The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar(1), and it was heard in part along with that appeal but was adjourned to enable the respondent State to file an affidavit explaining the circumstances which led to the enactment of the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures (Third Amendment) Ordinance, 1949 (No. XLVI of 1949), hereinafter referred to as the impugned Ordinance.
As in the West Bengal case, the jurisdiction of the Special Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, which tried and convicted the appellant, was challenged on the ground that the impugned Ordinance, under which the Court was constitut ed, was discriminatory and void.
The Objection was overruled by the Special Judge as well as by the High Court of Sau rashtra on appeal and the appellant now seeks a decision of this Court on the point.
The impugned Ordinance purports to amend the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures Ordinance (No. IX of 1948) which had been passed ""to provide for public safety, mainte nance of public order and preservation of peace and tran quillity in the State of Saurashtra"", by the insertion of sections 7 to 18 which deal with the establishment of Spe cial Courts of criminal jurisdiction in certain areas to try certain classes of offences in accordance with a simplified and shortened procedure.
Section 9 empowers the State by notification to constitute Special Courts for such 'areas as may be specified in the notification and section 10 provides for appointment of Special Judges to preside over such courts.
Section 11 enacts that the Special Judge shall try ""such offences or classes of offences or such cases or classes of cases as the Government may, by general or special order in writing; direct"", (1) Since reported as ; 57 57 440 Then follow provisions prescribing the procedure applicable to the trial of such offences.
The only variations in such procedure from the normal procedure in criminal trials in the State consist of the abolition of trial by jury or with the aid of assessors and the elimination of the inquiry before commitment in sessions cases.
Even under the normal procedure trial by jury is not compulsory unless the Govern ment so directs (sections 268 and 269 (1)).
while assessors are not really members of the court and their opinion is not binding on the judge with whom the responsibility for the decision rests.
Nor can the commitment proceeding in a sessions case be said to be an essential requirement of a fair and impartial, trial, though its dispensation may involve the deprivation of certain advantages which an accused person may otherwise enjoy.
Thus the variations from the normal procedure are by no means calculated to imperil the chances of a fair and impartial trial.
In exercise of the power conferred by sections 9, 10 and 11, the Government issued the notification No. H/35 5 C dated 9/11 February, 1950, directing that a Special Court shall be constituted for certain special areas and that it shall try certain specified offences which included offences under sections 302, 307 and 392 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (as adapted and applied to the State of Saurashtra) for which the appellant was convicted and sen tenced.
It is contended on behalf of the appellant that section 11 and the notification referred to above are discriminatory in that the offences alleged to have been committed by the appellant within the specified areas are required to be tried by the Special Judge under the special procedure, while any person committing the same offences outside those areas would be tried by the ordinary courts under the ordi nary procedure.
It is also urged that sections 9 and 11 by empowering the State Government to establish a Special Court and to direct it to try under a special procedure such offences as may be notified by the Government, in effect, authorise the Government to 441 amend section 5 of the Criminal Procedure Code read with the Second Schedule (as adapted and applied to the State of Saurashtra), which provides that ""all offences under the Indian Penal Code shall be investigated, enquired into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions hereinafter contained"", and that delegation of such power to the executive Government was beyond the competence of a legislature and was, therefore, void.
On the first point, many of the considerations which weighed with me in upholding the constitutionality of sec tion 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, which is in identical terms with section 11 of the impugned Act, apply a fortiori to the present case.
The West Bengal case (1) arose out of a reference by the State Government of certain individual cases to the Special Court for trial and 1 there expressed the view that it was wrong to think that classification was something that must somehow be discovera ble in every piece of legislation or it would not be legis lation.
That way of regarding classification, I pointed out, tended only to obscure the real nature of the problems for which we have to find solution.
In the present case, howev er, the State Government referred not certain individual cases but offences of certain kinds committed in certain areas and so the objection as to discriminatory treatment is more easily answered on the line of reasoning indicated in my judgment in the West Bengal case (1).
Again, the varia tions from the normal procedure authorised by the impugned Ordinance are less disadvantageous to the persons tried before the Special Court than under the West Bengal Act.
It was, however, said that any variation in procedure which operates materially to the disadvantage of such persons was discriminatory and violative of article 14.
On the other hand, it was contended on behalf of the respondent State that, in the field of personal liberty, the only constitu tional safeguards were those specifically.
provided in articles 20 to 22, and 'this Court having held in (1) [1952] S.C.R.284.
442 Gopalan 's case (1) that any procedure prescribed by law satisfies the requirements of article 21 (the only article relevant here) the impugned Ordinance which prescribes a special procedure for trial of offences falling within its ambit could not be held to be unconstitutional.
Reliance was placed on a decision of a Full Bench of the Hyderabad High Court (Abdur Rahim and others vs Joseph A. 'Pinto and others (2) which seems to lend some support to this view.
I am, however, of opinion that neither of these extreme con tentions is sound.
All legislative differentiation is not necessarily dis criminatory.
In fact, the word ""discrimination"" does not occur in article 14.
The expression ""discriminate against"" is used in article 15 (1) and article.
16(2), and it means, according to the Oxford Dictionary, ""to make an adverse distinction with regard to; to distinguish unfavourably from others"".
Discrimination thus involves an element of unfa vourable bias and it is in that sense that the expression has to be understood in this context.
If such bias is disclosed and is based on any of the grounds mentioned in articles 15 and 16, it may well be that the statute will, without more, incur condemnation as violating a specific constitutional prohibition unless it is saved by one or other of the provisos to those articles.
But the position under article 14 is different.
Equal protection claims under that article are examined with the presumption that the State action is reasonable and justified.
This pre sumption of constitutionality stems from the wide power of classification which the legislature must, of necessity, possess in making laws operating differently as regards different groups of persons in order to give effect to its policies.
The power of the State to regulate criminal trials by constituting different courts with different procedures according to the needs of different parts of its territory is an essential part of its police power (cf.
Missouri vs Lewis)(3).
Though the differing (1) ; (3) 101 U.S.22 (2) A.I.R. 1951 Hyderabad ll. 443 procedures might involve disparity in the treatment of the persons tried under them, such disparity is not by itself sufficient, in my opinion, to outweigh the presumption and establish discrimination unless the degree of disparity goes beyond what the reason for its existence demands as, for instance, when it amounts to a denial of a fair and impar tial trial.
It is, therefore, not correct to say that arti cle 14 provides no further constitutional protection to personal liberty than what is afforded by article 21.
Notwithstanding that its wide general language is greatly qualified in its practical application by a due recognition of the State 's necessarily wide powers of legislative clas sification, article 14 remains an important bulwark against discriminatory procedural laws.
In the present case, the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent State by one of its responsible officers states facts and figures relating to an increasing number of incidents of looting, robbery, dacoity, nosecutting and murder by marauding gangs of dacoits in certain areas of the State, and these details support the claim that ""the securi ty of the State and public peace were jeopardised and that it became impossible to deal with the offences that were committed in different places in separate courts of law expeditiously.
"" The statement concludes by pointing out that the areas specified in the notification were the ""main zones of the activities of the dacoits as mentioned above.
"" The impugned Ordinance having thus been passed to combat the increasing tempo of certain types of regional crime, the two fold classification on the lines of type and territory adopted in the impugned Ordinance, read with the notifi cation issued thereunder, is, in my view, reasonable and valid, and the degree of disparity of treatment involved is in no way in excess of what the situation demanded.
On the second point, the appellant 's learned counsel claimed that the majority view in In re The , etc.(1) supported his contention.
He attempted to make this out by piecing together certain dicta (1) ; 444 found in the several judgments delivered in that case.
While undoubtedly certain definite conclusions were reached by the majority of the Judges who took part in the decision in regard to the constitutionality of certain specified enact ments, the reasoning in each case was different and it is difficult to say that any particular principle has been laid down by the majority which can be of assistance in the determination of other cases.
I have there expressed my view that legislatures in this country have plenary authori ty to delegate their power to make laws to subordinate agencies of their choice and such delegation, however inex pedient or undesirable politically, is constitutionally competent.
I accordingly reject this contention.
It follows that the Special Judge had jurisdiction to try the appellant and the persons accused along with him.
As the majority concur in overruling the preliminary objection the appeal will be heard on the merits.
FAZL ALI J.
This is an appeal by one Kathi Raning Rawat, who has been convicted under sections 302, 307 and 392.
read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to death and to seven years ' rigorous imprison ment.
The appellant was tried by a Special Court constitut ed under the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures(Third Amendment) Ordinance, 1949 (Ordinance No. LXVI of 1949), which was issued by the Rajpramukh of Saurashtra on the 2nd November, 1949, and his conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal by the State High Court.
He has preferred an appeal to this Court against the decision of the High Court.
The principal question which arises in this appeal is whether the Ordinance to which reference has been made is void under article 13(1) of the Constitution on the ground that it violates the provisions of article 14.
It appears that on the 5th April, 1948, the Rajpramukh of Saurashtra State promulgated an Ordinance called the Criminal Proce dure Code, 1898 (Adaptation) Ordinance, 1948 (Ordinance No. XII of 445 1948), by which ""the Criminal Procedure Code of the Dominion of India as in force in that Dominion on the 1st day of April, 1948"" was made applicable to the State of Saurashtra with certain modifications.
In the same month, another Ordinance called the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures Ordinance (Ordinance No. IX of 1948) was promulgated, which provided among other things for the detention of persons acting in a manner prejudicial to public safety, maintenance of public order and peace and tranquillity in the State.
Subsequently, on the 5th November, 1949, the Ordinance with which we are concerned, namely, the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures (Third Amendment) Ordinance, 1949, was promulgated, which purported to amend the previous Ordinance by inserting in it certain provisions which may be summa rised as follows : Section 9 of the Ordinance empowers the State Government by notification in the Official Gazette to constitute Spe cial Courts of criminal jurisdiction for such area as may be specified in the notification.
Section 11 provides that a Special Judge shall try such offences or classes of offences or such cases or classes of cases as the State Government may, by general or special order in writing, direct.
Sec tions 12 to 18 lay down the procedure for the trial of cases by the Special Judge, the special features of which are as follows : (1) The Special Judge may take cognizance offences without the accused being committed to his court for trial; (2) There is to be no trial by jury or with the aid of assessors; (3) The Special Judge should 'ordinarily record a memo randum only of the substance of the evidence of each wit ness; and (4) The person convicted has to appeal to the High Court within 15 days from the date of the sentence.
446 The Ordinance further provides that the provisions of sections 491 and 526 of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall not apply to any person or case triable by the Special Judge, and the High Court may call for the record of the proceedings of any case tried by a Special Judge and may exercise any of the powers conferred on an appellate court by sections 423, 426, 427 and 428 of the Code.
From the foregoing summary of the provisions of the Ordinance, it will appear that the difference between the procedure laid down in the Criminal Procedure Code and the procedure to be followed by the Special Judge consists mainly in the following matters: (1) Where a case is triable by a court of session, no commitment proceeding is necessary, and the Special Judge may take cognizance without any commitment; (2) The trial shall not be by jury or with the aid of assessors; (3) Only a memorandum of the substance of the evidence of.
each witness is ordinarily to be recorded; (4) The period of limitation for appeal to the High Court is curtailed; and (5) No court has jurisdiction to transfer any case from any Special Judge, or to make an order under section 491 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
It appears that pursuant to the provisions contained in sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Ordinance, the State Government issued a Notification No. H/35 5 C, dated the 9/11th Febru ary, 1951, directing the constitution of a Special Court for certain areas mentioned in a schedule attached to the Noti fication and empowering such court to try the following offences, namely, offences under sections 183, 189, 190, 212, 216, 224, 302, 304, 307, 323 335, 341 344, 379 382, 384 389 and 392 402 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, as adapted and applied to the State of Saurashtra, and most of t, be offences under the.
Ordinance of 1948.
447 In the course of the hearing, an affidavit was filed by the Assistant Secretary in the Home Department of the Sau rashtra Government, stating that since the integration of different States in Kathiawar in the beginning of 1948 there had been a series of crimes against public peace and that had led to the promulgation of Ordinance No. IX of 1948, which provided among other things for detention of persons acting in a manner prejudicial to public safety and mainte nance of public order in the State.
Notwithstanding this Ordinance, the crimes went on increasing and there occurred numerous cases of dacoity, murder, nosecutting, ear cutting, etc.
for some of which certain notorious gangs were respon sible, and hence Ordinance No. LXVI of 1949 was promulgated to amend the earlier Ordinance and to constitute Special Courts for the speedy trial of cases arising out of the activities of the dacoits and other criminals guilty of violent crimes.
As has been already indicated, the main contention advanced before us on behalf of the appellant is that the Ordinance of 1949 violates the provisions of article 14 of the Constitution, by laying down a procedure which is dif ferent from and less advantageous to the accused than the ordinary procedure laid down in the Criminal Procedure Code, and thereby discriminating between persons who are to be tried under the special procedure and those tried under the normal procedure.
In support of this argument, reliance is placed on the decision of this court in The Slate of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar and Gajen Mali (Cases Nos. 297 and 298 of 1951) (1), in which certain provisions of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1949, have been held to be unconstitutional on grounds similar to those urged on behalf of the appellant in the present ease.
A comparison of the provisions of the Ordinance in question with those of the West Bengal Act will show that several of the objectionable features in the latter enactment do not appear in the Ordi nance, (1) ; 58 448 but, on the whole, I am inclined to think that that circum stance by itself will not afford justification for upholding the Ordinance.
There is however one very important differ ence between the West Bengal Act and the present Ordinance which, in my opinion, does afford such justification, and I shall try to refer to it as briefly as possible.
I think that a distinction should be drawn between""dis crimination without reason"" and ' 'discrimination with rea son"".
The whole doctrine of classification is based on this distinction and on the well known fact that the circum stances which govern one set of persons or objects may not necessarily be the same as those governing another set of persons or objects, so that the question of unequal treat ment does not really arise as between persons governed by different conditions and different sets of circum stances.
The main objection to the West Bengal Act was that it permitted discrimination ""without reason"" or with out any rational basis.
Having laid down a procedure which was materially different from and less advantageous to the accused than the ordinary procedure, that Act gave uncon trolled and unguided authority to the State Government to put that procedure into operation in the trial of any case or class of cases or any offence or class of offences.
There was no principle to be found in that Act to control the application of the discriminatory provisions or to correlate those provisions to some tangible and rational objective, in such a way as to enable anyone reading the Act to say : If that is the objective, the provisions as to special treatment of the offences seem to be quite suitable and there can be no objection to dealing with a particular type of offences on a special footing.
The mere mention of speedier trial as the object of the Act did not cure the defect, because the expression ""speedier trial"" standing by itself provided no rational basis of classification.
It was merely a description of the result sought to be achieved by the application of the special procedure laid down in the Act ' and afforded no help in determining what cases required speedier trial.
449 As regards the present Ordinance, we can discover a guiding principle within its four corners, which cannot but have the effect of limiting the application of the special procedure to a particular category of offences only and establish such a nexus (which was missing in the West Bengal Act) between offences of a particular category and the object with which the Ordinance was promulgated, as should suffice to repel the charge of discrimination and furnish some justification for the special treatment of those of fences.
The Ordinance, as I have already stated, purported to amend another Ordinance, the object of which was to provide for public safety, maintenance of public order and preservation of peace and tranquillity in the State.
It was not disputed before us that the preamble of the original Ordinance would govern the amending Ordinance also, and the object of promulgating the subsequent Ordinance was the same as the object of promulgating the original Ordinance.
Once this is appreciated, It is easy to see that there is something in the Ordinance itself to guide the State Govern ment to apply the special procedure not to any and every case but only to those cases or offences which have a ra tional relation to, or connection with, the main object and purpose of the Ordinance and which for that reason become a class by themselves requiring to be dealt with on a special footing.
The clear recital of a definite objective furnishes a tangible and rational basis of classification to the State Government for the purpose of applying the provi sions of the Ordinance and for choosing only such offences or cases as affect public safety, maintenance of public order and preservation of peace and tranquillity.
Thus, under section 11, the State Government is expected to select only such offences or class of offences or class of cases for being tried by the special court in accordance with the special procedure, as are calculated to affect public safety, maintenance of public order, etc., and under section 9, the use of the special procedure must necessarily be confined to only disturbed areas or those areas where adoption of 450 public safety measures is necessary.
That this is how the Ordinance was intended to be understood and was in fact understood, is confirmed by the Notification issued on the 9/11th February by the State Government in pursuance of the Ordinance.
That Notification sets out 49 offences under the Indian Penal Code as adapted and applied to the State and certain other offences punishable under the Ordinance, and one can see at once that all these offences directly affect the maintenance of public order and peace and tran quillity.
The Notification also specifies certain areas in the State over which only the special court is to exercise jurisdiction.
There can be no dispute that if the State Legislature finds that lawlessness and crime are rampant and there is a direct threat to peace and tranquil lity in certain areas within the State, it is competent to deal with offences which affect the maintenance of public order and preservation of peace and tranquillity in those areas as a class by themselves and to provide that such offences shall be tried as expeditiously as possible in accordance with a special procedure devised for the purpose.
This, in my opinion, is in plain language the rationale of the Ordinance, and it will be going too far to say that in no case and under no circumstances can a legislature lay down a special procedure for the trial of a particular class of offences, and that recourse to a simplified and less cumbrous procedure for the trial of those offences, even when abnormal conditions prevail, will amount to a violation of article 14 of the Constitution.
I am satisfied that this case is distinguishable from the case relating to the West Bengal Act, but I also feel that the legislatures should have recourse to legislation such as the present only in very special circumstances.
The question of referring individual cases to the special court does not arise in this appeal, and I do not wish to express any opinion on it.
Certain other points were urged on behalf of the appel lant, namely, that the Ordinance suffers from excessive delegation of legislative authority, and that 451 the Rajpramukh had exceeded his powers in amending the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.
These contentions were found to be devoid of all force and have to be reject ed.
In the result, I would hold that the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures (Third Amendment) Ordinance is not unconstitutional, and accordingly overrule the objection as to the jurisdiction of the special court to try the appel lant.
MAHAJAN J.
The principal point for decision in the appeal is whether section 11 of the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures (Third Amendment) Ordinance (No. LXVI), 1949.
which came into force on 2nd November, 1949, is hit by article 14 of the Constitution inasmuch as it mentions no basis for the differential treatment prescribed in the Ordinance for trial of criminals in certain cases and for certain offences.
Section 11 of the Ordinance is in these terms : ""A Special Judge shall try such offences or classes of offences or such cases or classes of cases as the Government of the United State of Saurashtra may, by general or special order in writing, direct.
"" This section is in identical terms with section 5(1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act (Act X of 1950).
Section 5(1) of that Act provided as follows : ""A Special Court shall try such offences or classes of offences or cases or classes of cases, as the State Govern ment may, by general or special order in writing, direct.
"" The question whether section 5(1) of the Bengal Act (X of 1950) was hit by article 14 of the Constitution was an swered in the affirmative by this court in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar etc.(1) In that case I was of the opinion that even if the statute on the face of it was not discriminatory, it was so in its effect and opera tion inasmuch as it vested in the executive government unregulated official discretion and therefore had to be adjudged unconstitutional.
Section 11 of the Ordinance, like section 5(1) (1) ; 452 of the West Bengal Act, suggests no reasonable basis or classification either in respect of offences or in respect of cases.
It has laid down no measure for the grouping either of persons or of cases or of offences by which meas ure these groups could be distinguished from those outside the purview of the special Act.
The State Government can choose a case of a person similarly situate and hand it over to the special tribunal and leave the case of another person in the same circumstances to be tried by the procedure laid down in the Criminal Procedure Code.
It can direct that the offence of simple hurt be tried by the special tribunal while a more serious offence be tried in the ordinary way.
The notification in this case fully illustrates the point.
Offence of simple hurt punishable with two years ' rigorous imprisonment is included in the list of offences to be tried by the Special Judge, while a more serious offence of the same kind punishable with heavier punishment under section 308 is excluded from the list.
It is the mischief of section 11 of the Ordinance that makes such discrimination possible.
To my mind, offences falling in the group of sections 302 to 308, Indian Penal Code.
possess common characteristics and the appellant can reasonably complain of hostile dis crimination.
I am therefore of the opinion that section 11 of the Ordinance is unconstitutional and the conviction of the appellant under the Ordinance by the special judge is bad and must be quashed.
There will be a retrial of the appellant under the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The contention of the learned counsel for the State that the provisions of the Ordinance are in some respects distinguishable from the provisions of the West Bengal Special Courts Act cannot be sustained.
Reference was made to section 9 of the Ordinance which is in these terms : ""The Government of the United State of Saurashtra may by notification in the official gazette constitute Special Courts of criminal jurisdiction for such area as may be specified in the notification.
"" 453 This section is in the same terms as section 3 of the West Bengal Special Courts Act.
It only empowers the State Government to constitute Special Courts for any area or for the whole of the State of Saurashtra in the like manner in which section 3 empowered the West Bengal Government to constitute special courts for the whole of the State or any particular area, It does not in any way limit or curtail the power conferred on the State Government by the provi sions of section 11.
Reference was also made to the pream ble of the original Ordinance which uses the familiar con ventional phraseology: ""An Ordinance to provide for public safety, maintenance of public order and preservation of peace and tranquillity in the State of Saurashtra.
"" These words cannot limit the plain and unambiguous language of section 11 of the Ordinance which authorises the State Government to send any case or commit persons guilty of any offence to the special judge for trial by the procedure prescribed in the Ordinance.
MUKHERJEA J.
The appellant before us was tried,along with two other persons, by the Special Judge, Court of Criminal Jurisdiction, Saurashtra State, on charges of murder, at tempted murder and robbery under sections 302, 307 and 392 of the Indian Penal Code read with section 34.
By his judgment dated 20th December, 1950, the Special Judge con victed the appellant on all the three charges and sentenced him to death under section 302 and to seven years ' rigorous imprisonment both under sections 307 and 392 of the Indian Penal Code.
The conviction and sentences were upheld by the High Court of Saurashtra on appeal.
The appellant has now come to this court on the strength of a certificate granted by the High Court under articles 132(1) and 134(1)(c) of the Constitution.
The appeal has not been heard on its merits as yet.
It was set down for hearing on certain preliminary points of law raised by the learned counsel for the appellant attacking the legality of the entire trial on the ground that section 11 of the Saurashtra Public 454 Safety Measures Ordinance No. XLVI of 1949 passed by the Rajpramukh of Saurashtra as well as the Notification issued by the State Government on 9/11th February, 1951, under which the Special Court was constituted and the trial held, were void and inoperative.
The first and the main ground upon which the constitutional validity of the section and the notification has been assailed is that they are in conflict with the provision of article 14 of the Constitu tion.
The other point raised is that the provision of section 11 the Ordinance is illegal as it amounts to delegation of essential legislative powers by the State Legislature to the Executive.
So far as the first point is concerned, the learned counsel for the appellant has placed great reliance upon the majority decision of this court in two analogous appeals from the Calcutta High Court (being cases Nos. 297 and 298 of 1951)(1), where a similar question arose in regard to the validity of section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act, 1950.
In fact, it was because of our pronouncement in the Calcutta appeals that it was considered desirable to have the present case heard on the preliminary points of law.
It is not disputed that the language of section 11 of the Saurashtra Ordinance, with which we are now concerned, is identically the same as that of section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Special Courts Act.
The wording of the section is as follows: ""11.
Jurisdiction of Special Judges A Special Judge shall try such offences or classes of offences or such cases or classes of cases as the Government of the United State of Saurashtra may, by general or special order in writing, direct.
"" In the West Bengal Act there is a f","The Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures Ordinance, 1948, was passed ""to provide for public safety, maintenance of public order and preservation of peace and tranquillity in the State of Saurashtra.
"" As crimes involving violence such as dacoity and murder were increasing, this Ordinance was amended by the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures (Third Amendment) Ordinance, 1949, which, by secs.
9, 10 and 11, empowered the State Government by notification in the official gazette to constitute Special Courts of criminal Jurisdiction for such area as may be specified in the noti fication, to appoint Special Judges to preside over such Courts and to invest them with jurisdiction to try such offences or classes of offences or such eases or classes of cases as the Government may, by general or special order in writing, direct.
The procedure laid down by 436 the Ordinance for trial before such Courts varied from the normal procedure prescribed by the Criminal Procedure Code in two material respects, viz., there was no provision for trial by jury or with the aid of assessors, or for enquiry before commitment to sessions.
In exercise of the powers conferred by this Ordinance the Government, by a notifica tion, constituted a Special Court for certain areas and empowered that Court to try offences under sees.
183, 189, 302, 304, 307, 392 and certain other sections of the Indian Penal Code which were specified in the notification.
It was contended on behalf of the appellant who had been convicted by the Special Court under secs.
302, 307 and 392 of the Indian Penal Code read with sec.
34, that the Ordi nance of 1949 and the notification above mentioned contra vened article 14 of the Constitution and were therefore ultra vires and void: Held, per PATANJALI SASTRI C.J, FAZL ALI, MUKHERJEA and DAS JJ. (MEHR CHAND MAHAJAN, CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR and Bose JJ.
dissenting) That the impugned Ordinance in so far as it authorised the State Government to direct offences or class es of offences or classes of cases to be tried by the Spe cial Court did not contravene the provisions of article 14 and was not ultra vires or void.
The notification issued under the Ordinance was also not void.
PATANJALI SASTRI C.J.
All legislative differentation is not necessarily discriminatory.
Discrimination involves an element of unfavourable bias, and it is in that sense that the expression has to be understood in the context.
Equal protection claims under article 14 are examined with the presumption that the State action is reasonable and.
justi fied.
Though differing procedures might involve disparity in treatment of persons tried under them, such disparity is not.
in itself sufficient to outweigh this presumption and establish discrimation unless the degree of disparity goes beyond what the reason for its existence demands, e.g., when it amounts to a denial of a fair and impartial trial.
The impugned Ordinance having been passed to combat the increas ing tempo of certain types of regional crime, the two fold classification on the lines of type and territory adopted by the said Ordinance read with the notification issued there under was reasonable, and the degree of disparity of treat ment involved was in no way in excess of what the situation demanded.
While on the one hand it cannot be said that any variation of procedure which operates materially to the disadvantage of the accused is discriminatory and violates article 14, the other extreme view that article 14 provides no further constitutional protection to personal liberty than what is afforded by article 21 is also wrong, FAZL ALI J. A distinction must be drawn between ""dis crimination without reason"" and ""discrimination with reason"" 437 The whole doctrine of classification is based on this dis tinction and on the well known fact that the circumstances which govern one set of persons or objects may not neces sarily be the same as those governing another set of persons or objects so that the question of unequal treatment does not really arise as between persons governed by different conditions and different sets of circumstances.
The clear recital of a definite objective in the earlier Ordinance and the impugned Ordinance which amended it, furnished a tangi ble and rational basis of classification and the Ordinance and the notification did not violate article 14.
[The Legisla ture should however have recourse to legislation like this only in very special circumstances.] MUKHERJEA J. Where the legislative policy is clear and definite and as an effective method of carrying out that policy a discretion is vested by the statute upon a body of administrators or officers to make selective application of the law to certain classes or groups of persons, the statute itself cannot be condemned as a piece of discriminatory legislation.
In such cases, the power given to the execu tive body would import a duty on it to classify the subject matter of legislation in accordance with the objective indicated in the statute.
If the administrative body pro ceeds to classify persons or things on a basis which has no rational relation to the objective of the legislature, its action can certainly be annulled as offending against the equal protection clause.
The preamble of the main Ordinance (IX of 1948) taken along with the surrounding circumstances disclosed a defi nite legislative policy and objective, and the impugned Ordinance cannot therefore be held to be unconstitutional merely because it vested in the Government the authority to constitute Special Courts and to specify the classes of,offences to be tried by such courts with a view to achieve that objective.
The notification issued by the Government was also not void as it did not proceed on any unreasonable or arbitrary basis but on the other hand there was a reasonable relation between the classification made b.y the notification and the objective that the legislation had in view.
Though it is a sound and reasonable proposition that when the nature of two offences is intrinsically the same and they are punishable in the same manner, a person accused of one should not be treated differently from a person accused of the other, yet in determining the reach and scope of a particular legislation it is not necessary for the legislature to provide abstract symmetry.
A too rigid insistence on anything like scientific classification is neither practicable nor desirable.
DAS J. The relevant part of sec.
11 properly construed and understood does not confer an uncontrolled and unguided power on the State Government; on the contrary, the power is controlled by the necessity of making a proper classifi cation 438 which is to be guided by the preamble in the sense that the classification must have a rational relation to the object of the Ordinance as recited in the preamble.
The classifica tion effected by the impugned Ordinance and the notification thus satisfied the two conditions necessary for a valid classification, viz., that it must not be arbitrary but must be rounded on an intelligible differentia, and that differ entia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act.
The Ordinance and the notification did not therefore contravene article 14 of the Constitution.
MAHAJAN J. Section 11 of the Ordinance suggests no reasonable basis for classification either in respect of offences or in respect of cases, nor has it laid down any measure for the grouping either of persons or of cases or of offences, by which measure these groups could be distin guished from those outside the purview of the Ordinance.
The words used in the preamble to the main Ordinance and the fact that sec.
9 of the impugned Ordinance provides that the power can be exercised for any particular area cannot limit the plain and unambiguous language of sec.
11, and the said section is therefore unconstitutional.
CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J. Sections 9 and 11 do not lay down any classification.
The preamble to the earlier Ordi nance also indicates no classification as the object stated there is a general one which has to be kept in view by every enlightened Government or system of administration.
The classification adopted in the notification also is not a rational one.
BOSE J.
The differentiation effected by the impugned Ordinance and the notification issued thereunder travels beyond bounds which are legitimate and the Ordinance there fore offends article 14 and is invalid.
Held also, per curiam, that the Ordinance was not in valid on the ground that it involved delegation of legisla tive powers.

December 21.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
This appeal is directed against an appellate judgment of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court dated November 27, 1945, reversing the decision of the Subordinate Judge of ' Mayuram made in Original Suit No. 34 of 1943.
There is no dispute about the material facts of the case which lie within a short compass and the controversy centers round one point only which turns upon the construction of a will left by one Kothandarama Ayyar to whom the properties in suit admittedly belonged.
Kothandarama, who was a Hindu inhabitant of the District of Tanjore and owned considerable properties, died on 25th April 1905, leaving behind him as his near relations his adoptive mother Valu Ammal, his widow Parbari and two daughters Nagammal and Gnanambal, of whom Nagammal,who became a widow during the testator 's life time had an infant daughter named Alamelu Kothandarama executed his last will on 13th March, 1905, and by this will, the genuineness of which is not disputed in the present litigation, he gave an authority to his widow to adopt unto him a son of his second daughter Gnanambal, should she beget one before January., 1908, or in the alter native any of the sons of his two nephews, if the widow so chose.
The suit, out of which the appeal arises, was commenced by Raju Ayyar, who was a son of the testator 's nephews and was taken in adoption by the widow in terms of the will; and it was for recovery of possession of certain properties, known as Kothangudi properties which formed part of the testator 's estate on the allegation that under the will mentioned above, these properties were given to Nagarnmal, the wid owed daughter of the testator for her life time, but as there was no disposition of the remaining interest after the death of the life tenant, the properties vested in the 952 plaintiff as the adopted son and heir of the deceased on the death of Nagammal which took place on 3rd of January, 1943.
Gnanambal, the second daughter of the testator, was the first and main defendant in the suit, and she resisted the plaintiff 's claim primarily on the ground that there was no intestacy as regards the suit properties after the termina tion of the life interest of Nagammal, and that under the terms of the will itself she was entitled to get these properties in absolute right after the death of Nagammal, subject to payment of a sum of Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu, the daughter of Nagammal.
Alamelu was made the second defendant in the suit and as she died when the suit was pending in the trial court, her heirs were impleaded as defendants 3 to 9.
The first court accepted the contention of the defendant No. 1 and dismissed the plaintiff 's suit.
On appeal to the High Court, the judgment was reversed and the plaintiff 's claim was allowed.
The defendant No. 1 has now come up appeal to this court.
To appreciate the contentions that have been raised by the parties to this appeal, it would be convenient first of all to refer briefly to the relevant provisions of the will: After cancelling his previous wills.
the testator in the third paragraph of his will, gave his widow authority to adopt a son.
She was to adopt the son of Gnanambal, if the latter got a son previous to January 1908, or she could adopt any of the sons of the testator 's nephews.
Paragraph 4 provides that if the first course is followed, that is, if the son of Gnanambal is adopted by the widow, then all the properties, movable and immovable, belonging to the testator excepting the village of Kothangudi, the house at Injigudi and the other properties which were disposed of by the will would go to such adopted son.
Paragraph 5, which is materi al for our present purposes runs as follows:. ""The whole village of Kothangudi and the house at Injigudi, both of Nannilam Taluk, my daughter Nagammal, shall enjoy with life interest and after her the said property shall pass to my daughter Gnanambal and her chil dren on payment by the latter of Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu Nagam mal 's daughter.
"" 953 By the sixth paragraph the Nallathukudi and Pungavur villages together with certain house property at Mayavaram are given to the testaor 's adoptive mother and wife in equal shares to be enjoyed by both of them during their life time and after their death they are to pass on to the adopted son.
Paragraph 7 gives a small h.use absolutely to Nagammal for her residence and paragraph 8 makes certain provisions for management of the properties.
In paragraph 9 direction is given to collect the money due on the insurance policy on the life of the testator and to pay off his debts.
Pragraph 10 mentions certain charities, the expenses of which are to be derrayed from the income of the Nallathukudi properties.
Paragraph 11 then says that in the event of the widow adopt ing any of the nephew 's sons of the testator, such son shall inherit the entire property at Kokkur and also the lands of Nallathukudi after the death of the testator 's wife and mother.
By paragraph 12, the village of Maruthanthanallur is given to Gnanambal and paragraph 13 provides that ""the village of Kothangudi shall be enjoyed by Nagammal as stated in paragraph 5"" By paragraphs 15 and 16 the remainder in the house at Mayavaram situated in the east row of Vellalar kovil Street is given to Gnanambal after the death of the testator 's wife and mother.
Paragraph 18 provides for cer tain other charities.
In paragraph 20 it is stated that if the wife of the testator should die before January, 1908, without making any adoption, then the eldest or any son of Gnanambal would be his adopted son without any formality and inherit all the properties subject to the conditions men tioned in the will.
Paragraph 21, which is the penultimate paragraph in the will, further lays down that if all the three contingencies fail and no adoption is taken, the male child or children born to Gnanambal shall inherit as grand sons all the properties of the testator, subject to the conditions specified in the will.
These, in brief, are the dispositions made in the will.
The plaintiff founds him claim upon paragraph 13 of the will which, according to him, contains the enire disposition so far as the Kothangudi 954 property is concerned.
That village is given to Nagarm mal for her life with no disposition of the remaining inter est.
If the remainder has not been disposed of, there is no doubt that the plaintiff would be entitled to the property as the heir of the testator under the ordinary law of inher itance.
The defendant No. 1.
on the other hand, relies on para graph 5 of the will, which gives the Kothangudi village and the Injigudi house to Nagammal to he enjoyed by her so long as she lives and after her death they are to go to Gnanambal and her children subject to the payment of a sum of Rs. 5,000 to be paid to Alamelu, the daughter of Nagammal.
The High Court on a construction of the will has found in favour of the plaintiff primarily on the ground that in the contingency which happened in the present case, viz., that the widow took in adoption a nephew 's son of the testa tor, paragraph 5 of the will did not come into operation at all.
The disposition as regards Kothangudi property is, therefore, to be found exclusively in paragraph 13 of the will and the actual words employed by the testator in that paragraph do not indicate that apart from Nagammal 's taking a life estate in the Kothangudi village the rest of the provisions in regard to this property as laid down in para graph 5 would also be incorporated into paragraph 13.
An Obvious difficulty, according to the learned Judges, in accepting the construction sought to be put upon the will by defendant No. 1 is that paragraph 5 speaks both of Kothan gudi and Injigudi properties, whereas paragraph 13 does not mention the Injigudi house at all, nor does it purport to give a life interest in the same to Nagammal.
It could not be reasonably held on a construction of the will that the intention of the testator was that Gnanambal was to pay Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu for the Kothangudi property alone.
The result was that the plaintiff 's claim was allowed.
It is the propriety of this decision that has been challenged before us in this appeal.
In course of the arguments, we have been referred by the learned Counsel on both sides to quite a large 955 number of decided authorities, both English and Indian, in support of their respective contentions.
It is seldom prof itable to compare the words of one will with those of anoth er or to attempt to find out to which of the wills upon which decisions have been: given in reported cases, the will before us approximates closely.
Cases are helpful only in so far as they purport to lay down certain general princi ples of construction and at the present day these general principles seem to be fairly well settled.
The cardinal maxim to be observed by courts in constru ing a will is to endeavour to ascertain the intentions of the testator.
This intention has to be gathered primarily from the language of the document which is to be read as a whole without indulging in any conjecture or speculation as to what the testator would have done if he had been better informed or better advised.
In construing the language of the will as the Privy Council observed in Venkata Narasimha vs Parthasarathy (1), ""the courts are entitled and bound to bear in mind other matters than merely the words used.
They must consider the surrounding circumstances, the position of the testator, 'his family relationship, the probability that he would use words in a particular sense, and many other things which are often summed up in the somewhat picturesque figure 'The court is entitled to put itself into the testator 's armchair ' .
But all this is solely as an aid to arriving at a right construction of the will, and to ascertain the meaning of its language when used by that particular testator in that document.
So soon as the con struction is settled, the.duty of the court is to carry out the intentions as expressed, and none other.
The court is in no case justified in adding to testamentary dispositions.
In all cases it must loyally carry out the will as properly construed, and this duty is universal, and is true alike of wills of every nationality and every religion or rank of life."" A question is sometimes raised as to whether in constru ing a will the court should lean against (1) 42 I.A. 51 at p.70.
956 intestacy.
The desire to avoid intestacy was considered by the Privy Council in the case referred to above as a rule based on English necessity and English habits of thought which should not necessarily bind an Indian court.
It seems that a presumption against intestacy may be raised if it is justified by the context of the document or the surrounding circumstances; ""but it can be invoked only when there is undoubted ambiguity in acertainment of the intentions of the testator.
As Lord Justice Romer observed in Re Edwards; Jones vs Jones (1), ""it cannot be that merely with a view to avoiding intestacy you are to do otherwise than construe plain words according to their plain meaning"".
It is in the light of the above principles that we should proceed to examine the contents of the will before us.
The present will, which is the last of four testamentary document executed by the testator, appears to have been prepared with a great deal of care and circumspection.
The testator had clearly in mind the different situations that might arise in case his widow adopted either Gnanambal 's son or a son of one of the nephews of the testator.
He envis aged also the possibility of the widow dying without making any adoption at all.
Besides the son to be adopted, the only other relations who had natural claims upon the affection and bounty of the testator and for whom he desired to make provisions were his wife, his adoptive mother, the two datughters and the infant grand daughter.
The interests given to his wife, the adoptive mother and the eldest daugh ter, who were all widows, were for their life time, except a small house property which was given absolutely for the residence of the eldest daughter.
On the other hand., the bequests in favour of Gnanambal, who was a married daughter, and the adopted son of the testator, were absolute in their character.
Besides these dispositions, there were certain gifts for charity which were to be met out of the income of the properties given to the wife and the adoptive mother for their lives.
One singular feature (1) [1906]1 Ch. 570 at p. 574. 957 in the will is that the testator took scrupulous care to include in it every item of property that he owned.
There are two provisions in the will relating Kothan gudi property to which the dispute in the present suit relates.
One is in paragraph 5 which gives this property along with the house at Injigudi to Nagammal, the remainder being given to the appellant subject to the payment of a sum of Rs. 5, 000 to Alamelu, the daughter of Nagammal.
The other is in paragraph 13, which merely says that Nagammal was to get it for life as stated in paragraph 5.
The view taken by the High Court and which has been pressed for our acceptance here by the learned Counsel for the respondents is that paragraph 5 was meant to be operative only if Gna nambal 's son was adopted by the widow.
As that was not done, paragraphs 4 to 8 of the will, it is urged, will go out of the picture alttgether and it is not permissible to refer to them except to the extent that they were impliedly incorporated in the subsequent paragraphs of the will.
We do not think that this is the correct way of reading the document.
The testator undoubtedly contemplated different contingencies; but a reading of the whole will does not show that he wanted to make separate and self contained provisions with regard to each of the contingencies that might arise and that each set of provisions were to be read as exclusive of the other set or sets.
That does not appear to be the scheme of the will.
The testator 's main desire undoubtedly was that his widow should adopt the son of his daughter Gnanambal, and in the first part his will after making provisions for his two daughters, his wife and adoptive mother and also for certain charities, he left the rest of his properties to the son of Gnanambal that was to be adopted by his widow.
In the second part of the will, which is comprised in paragraphs 11 to 16, the testator sets out the modifications which he desires to make in the earli er dispositions in case a son of one of his nephews was adopted by the widow.
It was not the intention of the testa tor that on the happening of the second contingency, all 958 the earlier provisions of the will would stand cancelled and the entire dispositions of the testator 's property would have to be found within the four corners of paragraphs 11 to 16 of the will.
In our opinion, the provisions made for the two daughters, the widow and the adoptive mother as made in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of the will and also the provisions for charities and payment of debts contained in paragraphs 9 and 10 were meant to be applicable under all the three contingencies referred to above.
This is clear from the fact that provisions of paragraphs 7, 9 and 10 have not been repeated or incorporated in paragraphs 11 to 16, although it cannot be suggested that they were not to take effect on the happening of the second contingency.
Again in the third contingency contemplated by the testator, which is described in paragraph 20, it is expressly stated that if no adoption is made, the eldest or any son of Gnanambal would inher it the properties and he shall take the properties subject to the conditions mentioned in the will.
The conditions spoken of here undoubtedly refer to the provi sions made for the mother, wife and the two daughters of the testator as well as in respect to payment of debts and carrying out of the charities specified in paragraph 10.
The changes that are to take effect on the happening of the second event are in regard to the bequests in favour of the adopted son.
Under paragraph 4 of the will, the adopted son was to get all the p. roperties of the testator with the exception of those given to the two daughters, the mother and the wife.
Under paragraph 11, if the adoption is of a nephew 's son of the testator, the adopted son gets only the Kokkur properties and the reversionary interestin Nallathukudi village after the death of the testator 's wife and mother.
The village Maruthanthanallur which would go to the adopted son under paragraph 4 is taken away under para graph 11 and is given to Gnanambal.
She is also given the remaining interest in the Mayavaram house which was given to the adopted son under paragraph 6.
Subject to the changes thus made, the provisions 959 of paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 would, in our opinion, still remain operative even if the person adopted was a nephew 's son of the testator.
No change is made in paragraphs 11 to 16 with regard to the provision in paragraph 5 of the will.
In paragraph 13 it is only stated that the village Kothangudi shall be enjoyed by Nagammal as stated in paragraph 5.
It may be conceded that this statement by itself does not let in the entire provision of paragraph 5, but that is not material for our present purpose.
It is enough that para graph 5 has not been changed or altered in any way.
The statement in paragraph 13 may, after all, be a loose expres sion which the testator used only for the purpose of empha sising that the Kothangudi village would be enjoyed by Nagammal even if Gnanambal 's son was not adopted.
This is not by way of making any new disposition, but only to affirm what has been already done.
The affirmation of a portion of the provision which is perfectly superfluous cannot exclude the rest.
It is somewhat difficult to say why the rest of the provisions in paragraph 5, particularly the benefit that was meant to be given to Alamelu, was not repeated in para graph 13.
It may be that the testator did not consider it necessary or it may be that it was due to inadvertance.
It is to be noted here that the testator did not mention any where in paragraphs 11 to 16 the small house that was given absolutely to Nagamreal under paragraph 7.
It was certainly not the intention of the testator that Nagammal would not have that house on the happening of the second contingency.
If paragraph 5 itself is held to be applicable and in our opinion it should be so held there is no question of adding to or altering any of the words made use of by the testator.
It is not a question of making a new will for the testator or inventing a bequest for certain persons simply because the will shows that they were the objects of the testator 's affection.
The provision is in the will itself and it is only a question of interpretation as to whether it is ap plicable in the circumstances which have happened in the present case.
The position, therefore, seems 960 to be that the disposition made in paragraphs 5, 6 and 7, which were in favour of the mother, the wife and the two daughters of the testator were meant to take effect immedi ately on the testator 's death.
They were not contingent gifts in the sense of being made dependent upon the adoption of Gnanambal 's son by the wife of the testator.
Only the reversionary interest in the Mayavaram house, which was to vest in the adopted son under the provision of paragraph 6 after the death of the widow and the mother was taken away from the adopted son and given to Gnanambal in case the person adopted was not her own son.
If the whole of para graph 5 remains operative the Injigudi house must also be deemed to have been given to Nagammal for her life and in fact the evidence is that she enjoyed it so long as she was alive.
No difficulty also arises regarding the payment of Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu as has been stated by the High Court in its judgment.
Having regard to the meticulous care with which the testator seems to have attempted to provide for the differ ent contingencies that might arise and the anxiety displayed by him in making an effective disposition of all the proper ties he owned, it is not probable that he would omit to make any provision regarding the future devolution of the Kothan gudi village if he really thought that such direction had to be repeated in the latter part of the will.
The omission of the gift of Rs. 5,000 to Alamelu also cannot be explained on any other hypothesis.
It is not necessary for the purpose of the present case to invoke any rule of presumption against.
intestacy, but if the presumption exists at all, it certainly fortifies the conclusion which we have arrived at.
The result is that the appeal is allowed, the judgment and decree of the of the High Court are set aside and those of the Subordinate Judge restored.
The appellant will have costs of all the courts.
Appeal allowed.

","The cardinal maxim to be observed by courts in constru ing a will is to endeavour to ascertain the infentions of the testator.
This intention has to be gathered primarily from the language of the document which is to be read as a whole without indulging in any conjecture or speculation as to what the testator would have done if he had been better informed or better advised.
The courts are however entitled and bound to bear in mind other matters than merely the words used.
They must consider the surrounding circumstances, the position of the testator, his family relationship, the probability that he would use words in a particular sense, and many other things which are often summed up in the somewhat picturesque figure the court is entitled to put itself into the testator 's armchair '.
But all this is solely as an aid to arriving at a right construetion of the will, and to ascertain the meaning of the language when used by that particular testator in that document.
As soon as the construction is settled, the duty of the court is to carry out the intsentions as expressed.
The court is in no case justified in adding to testamentary dispositions.
In all cases it must loyally carry out the will as properly construed, and this duty is 950 universal, and is true alike of wills of every nationality and every religion or rank of life.
A presumption against intestacy may be raised if it is justified by the context of the document or the surrounding circumstances; but it can be invoked only when there is undoubted ambignity in ascertainment of the intentions of the testator.
It cannot be that merely with a view to avoiding intestacy you are to do otherwise than construe plain words according to their plain meaning.
A Hindu died leaving a widow, a widowed daughter and a married daughter G, after he had made a will giving authori ty to his widow to adopt a son of G should she beget one, or in the alternative a son of one of his nephews.

The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
This is an appeal by the defendants from a decree of the Patna High Court reversing a decree of the Subordinate Judge 's Court at Patna, and de creeing the plaintiffs ' suit for possession against the defendant first party who may be called for the sake of convenience as 'the Gopes '.
The lands were khudkhasht lands, partly belonging to the plaintiffs first party and partly belonging to Mussammat Anaro Kuer, from whom the plaintiffs second and third par ties trace title.
The ancestors of plaintiffs first party gave on 28 9 1899 an ijara with possession to one Lakhandeo Singh an ancestor of the defendant second party under Exhib it I (b) for a term 777 of six years from 1307 Fasli to 1312 Fasli for Rs. 540.
The poshgi money was to be repaid in one lump sum at the end of Fasli 1312.
If there was no redemption then the ijara was to continue in force till the money was repaid.
Mussammat Anaro Kuer gave her share in ijara to the same Lakhandeo Singh orally on 10th June, 1905, for a period of three years for Rs. 542.
Lakhandeo Singh, who is represented now by the defendant second party, made a settlement of the land thus got by him (8.26 acres or 13 bighas in all) with one Ram Lal Gope an ancestor of the defendant first party for a period of three years from Fasli 1315 to Fasli 1318.
There was a patta in favour of the tenant and a kabuliyat in favour of the landlord.
This was in 1908.
The mortgage was redeemed in June 1942 by payment in proceedings under section 83 of the Transfer of Property Act, When the plaintiffs went to take possession, they were resisted by the Gopes (defendant first party), and after unsuccessful criminal proceedings, the plaintiffs filed the present suit.
The Subordinate Judge dismissed it, holding that the Gopes were raiyats having acquired permanent occupancy rights in the lands as the result of the settlement by the mortgagee, Lakhandeo Singh.
On appeal the High Court set aside this decision and gave the plaintiffs a decree for possession on the finding that the defendants were not raiyats and had no permanent rights of occupancy.
This court granted to the defendants special leave to appeal.
The suit was in the alternative for recovery of the value of the lands as compensation or damages from the defendant second party in case it was found that the defendant first party could not be ejected.
The trial court decreed this alternative claim and awarded to the plaintiffs compensation at the rate of Rs. 200 per bigha.
The defendant second party carried the matter in appeal to the High Court and succeeded.
But we have nothing to do with this matter in the present appeal.
At the trial, the plaintiffs alleged and maintained that the lands were their zirat lands within the meaning SUPREME 778 of section 116 of the Bihar Tenancy Act and that the defend ant first party could acquire no rights of occupancy in the same.
The Subordinate Judge found against this contention and held that they were khud kasht or bakasht lands of the proprietor, in which rights of occupancy can be acquired He negatived the plea of the defendants that they were their ancestral raiyati lands.
He also held that there was no collusion between the mortgagee Lakhandeo Singh and Ram Lal Gope in the matter of settlement of lands.
It is on the basis of these findings which were accepted by both the parties that the hearing of the appeal proceeded before the High Court.
It was held by the Privy Council in Bengal Indigo Company vs Roghobur Das(1) that ""a zuripeshgi lease is not a mere contract for the cultivation of the land at a rent, but is a security to the tenant for the money advanced"".
They observed, speaking of the leases before them, that ""the leases in question were not mere contracts for the cultiva tion of the land let; but that they were also intended to constitute, and did constitute, a real and valid security to the tenant for the principal sums which he had advanced, and interest thereon.
The tenants ' possession under them was, in part at least, not that of cultivators only, but that of creditors operating repayment of the debt due to them, by means of their security.
"" These words apply to the ijara deed before us; its dominant intention was to provide a security for the loan advanced and not to bring into existence any relationship of landlord and ten ant.
The general rule is that a person cannot by transfer or otherwise confer a better title on another than he himself has.
A mortgagee cannot, therefore, create an interest in the mortgaged property which will enure beyond the termina tion of his interest as mortgagee.
Further, the mortgagee, who takes possession of the mortgaged property, must manage it as a person of ordinary prudence would manage it if it were his own; and he must not commit any act which is de structive (1) 779 or permanently injurious to the property; see section 76, sub clauses (a) & (e)of the Transfer of Property Act.
It follows that he may grant leases not extending beyond the period of the mortgage; any leases granted by him must come to an end at redemption.
A mortgagee cannot during the subsistence of the mortgage act in a manner detrimental to the mortgagor 's interests such as by giving a lease which may enable the tenant to acquire permanent or occupancy rights in the land thereby defeating the mortgagor 's right to khas possession; it would be an act which would fall within the provisions of section 76, subclause (e), of the Transfer of Property Act.
A permissible settlement by a mortgagee in possession with a tenant in the course of prudent management and the springing up of rights in the tenant conferred or created by statute based on the nature of the land and possession for the requisite period is a different matter altogether.
It is an exception to the general rule.
The tenant cannot be ejected by the mortgagor even after the redemption of the mortgage.
He may become an occupancy raiyat in some cases and a non occupancy raiyat in other cases.
But the settle ment of the tenant by the mortgagee must have been a bona fide one.
This exception will not apply in a case where the terms of the mortgage prohibit the mortgagee from making any settlement of tenants on the land either expressly or by necessary implication.
Where all the zamindari rights are given to the mortga gee, it may be possible to infer on the proper construction of the document that he can settle lands with tenants in the ordinary course of management and the tenants might acquire certain rights in the land in their capacity as tenants.
In the case of Manjhil Lal Biswa Nath Shah Deo vs Shaikh Mo hiuddin(1), there was a bona fide settlement of mortgaged rayati land by the mortgagee with tenants and it was held that the mortgagor was not entitled to evict them after redemption.
The earlier decision of Babu Bhairo Nath Ray vs Shanke Pahan(2), related to bakasht lands, and (1) (2) Pat.31.
780 there was no provision in the zuripeshgi lease restricting the power of the mortgagee lessee as regards settlement of tenants.
Khudkasht lands and bakasht lands are really in the nature of raiyati lands which come into the possession of the proprietor by surrender, abandonment or purchase.
In the present case.
we have the following clause in the ijara deed: ""It is desired that the ijaradar should enter into possession and occupation of the share let out in ijara (being the khudkasht land under his own cultivation), culti vate them, pay 2 annas as reserved rent year after year to us, the executants, and appropriate the produce thereof year after year on account of his having the ijaradari interest.
"" This term disentitles the mortgagee from locating tenants on the land mortgaged.
Ram Lal Gope, the grandfather of the defendants first party, who executed the kabuliat in 1908 must have known of the title of Lakhandeo Singh the mortga gee and the terms under which he held the lands under the registered zuripeshgi ijara deed and this is most probably why the tenant not only took the lease for a period of 3 years, but expressly undertook to give up possession over the thika lands on the expiry of the period of lease without urging any claim on the score that the lands were his old kasht lands.
His kabuliat (Exhibit 11) in fact refers to Lakhandeo Singh 's ijaradari interest.
In view of these facts, the learned Judges of the High Court stated that they were not prepared to hold that the settlement was a bona fide one or the mortgagee was within his rights in settling these lands.
Strong reliance was placed for the appellants on the Full Bench decision Binad Lal Pakrashi and Others vs Kalu Pramanik and Others (1) where it was held that a person inducted into possession of land as a raiyat even by a trespasser became a non occupancy raiyat within the meaning of section 5, sub section, 2 of the Bengal Tenancy Act and was protected from ejectment.
But this decision has been subsequently (1) Cal.
781 explained away in several cases as based on the proposition that the rights must have been bona fide acquired by them from one whom they bona fide believed to ' have the right to let them into possession of the land.
Such, however, is not the case here, in view of the recitals in the ijara deed in favour of Lakhandeo Singh and the kabuliat by Ram Lal Gope.
Sections 20 and 21 of the Bihar Tenancy Act were re ferred to by the learned counsel for the appellants in the course of his arguments and he pointed out that the land in this case was held ' continuously by his clients and their predecessors from 1908 to 1942, when they were sought to be ejected.
For these sections to apply, we must be in a position to hold that the appellants were ""settled raiy ats"".
""Raiyals"" is defined in sub clause 2 of section 5 as meaning ""primarily a person who has acquired a right to hold land for the purpose of cultivating it by himself or by members of his family . "" Sub clause 3 provides that a person shall not be deemed to be a raiyat unless he holds land either immediately under a proprietor or immediately under a tenure holder.
Lakhandeo Singh was not a ""proprie tor"" by which term is meant a person owning, whether in trust or for his own benefit, an estate or part of an es tate: he was only a mortgagee.
Nor was he a tenure holder or under tenureholder, as he does not comply with the defi nition given in sub clause (1) of section 5, namely, a person who had acquired from a proprietor or from another tenure holder a right to hold land for the purpose of col lecting rents, or for the purpose of bringing the land under cultivation by establishing tenants on it.
Such proof as there is in this case only goes to show that the lands were under the cultivation of the plaintiffs and that they were made over to the possession of the mortgagee so that he might cultivate them himself.
Hence, Ram Lal Gope could not claim that he was a settled raiyat of the village and that under the statute he secured occupancy rights in the lands Which he took on lease from Lakhandeo Singh.
782 Lastly, it was urged that the ijara by Mst.
Anaro Kuer was admittedly an oral transaction and there was no proof of any prohibition against the settlement with tenants so far as her share (3.97 acres) was concerned and that the rights of the parties as regards this area would stand on a differ ent footing from the rights in respect of the 4 acres and 29 cents belonging to the plaintiff first party.
This point was not taken in the courts below where the two ijaras given to Lakhandeo Singh were dealt with as if they were part and parcel of one and the same transaction, the rights and liabilities, whatever they were, being common to both.
We cannot allow the point to be taken now.
The result is that the High Court 's decree is con firmed and the appeal is dismissed with costs of the plain tiffs respondents.
There will be no order as to costs of the other respondents.
Appeal dismissed.

March 21.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZL ALl J.
The three appellants were tried by the Additional Sessions Judge at Amritsar and found guilty of having murdered two persons named Darshan Singh and Achhar Singh and sentenced to transportation for life.
The High Court of Punjab upheld their 841 conviction and sentence and granted them a certificate under article 134(1)(c)of the Constitution that the case is a fit one for appeal to this Court.
Hence this appeal.
The facts of the case may be briefly stated as follows.
On the evening of 16th December, 1948, a little before sunset, Achhar Singh, one of the murdered persons, went to the house of one Inder Singh in village Dalam for getting paddy husked.
Achhar Singh 's brother, Darshan Singh, who was working as a driver at Amritsar, came to Dalam from Amritsar the same evening, and, on coming to know from his father that Achhar Singh had gone to Inder Singh 's house, he also went there.
while the two brothers were returning home, they were attacked by the three appellants and two of their relatives in a lane adjoining Inder Singh 's house.
The five assailants, who were armed with deadly weapons, in flicted a number of injuries on the two victims, as a result of which they died then and there.
After the murder, the appellants and their companions tied the two dead bodies in two kheses (wrappers) and took them to village Saleempura where two other persons, named Ajaib Singh and Banta Singh, joined them, and the dead bodies after being dismembered were thrown into a stream known as Sakinala at a place about five miles from village Dalam.
Bela Singh, father of the deceased persons, who was one of the persons who claims to have witnessed the occurrence, did not leave the village at night on account of fear, but he started about two hours before sunrise on the next morning and lodged the first information report at 10 A.M. at the nearest police station.
A police officer arrived in village Dalam shortly after wards, and after investigation a charge sheet was submitted against seven persons including the present appellants.
At the trial, five of the accused were charged with offences under section 302 read with section 149 and under section 201 read with section 149 of the Indian Penal Code.
and the remaining two accused were charged with the offence under section 201 read with section 149 of that Code.
The learned Judge who tried 842 the accused, convicted the appellants and two other persons under section 302 read with section 149 of the Penal Code and sentenced them to transportation for life, and convicted Ajaib Singh under section 201 read with section 149 and sentenced him to three years ' R.I. Bantu Singh, accused, was acquitted.
On appeal, the Punjab High Court upheld the conviction of the present appellants and acquitted the remaining three persons.
Before proceeding to discuss the evidence in the case, it is necessary to refer to what has been.
described as the motive for the murder.
It appears that in June, 1947, Natha Singh, father of the third appellant, Swaran Singh, was murdered, and Darshan Singh and Achhar Singh, the two mur dered persons in the case before us, and their third broth er, Sulakhan Singh, were charged with the murder of that person.
As a result of the trial, Darshan Singh was acquit ted and Achhar Singh was sentenced to 11/2 years ' R.I., while Sulakhan Singh was sentenced to 7 years ' R.I.
The judgment of the Sessions Judge in that case was delivered shortly before the date of the present occurrence, and it is common ground that Achhar Singh had been released on bail by the appellate court and was at large at that time.
It is said that the appellants and their relatives felt aggrieved by the acquittal of Darshan Singh and by the light sentence passed on Achhar Singh, and therefore committed this murder in a spirit of frustration and revenge.
It was conceded before us by the learned counsel for the appellants that the facts stated above constituted a strong motive for the murder, but he also contended that they constituted an equally strong motive for the appellants being falsely implicated in case the murder was committed, as was suggest ed by him, in circumstances under which the murderers could not be seen or identified.
It therefore becomes necessary to set out the evidence adduced by the prosecution in support of the murder.
The evidence led by the prosecution may be divided under two main heads : (1) Direct evidence, and(2) Circumstantial evidence.
The direct evidence consists 843 of the testimony of four eye witnesses, namely, Bela Singh, father of the deceased, who claims to have gone to the scene of occurrence on hearing an outcry and to have witnessed the murderous assault on his sons; Inder Singh and his wife, Mst.
Taro, to whom the murdered persons had gone for getting paddy husked and who lived in a house adjoining the lane where the murder took place; and Gurcharan Singh, a resident of a different village, who states that he saw the occur rence when he was going towards village Dhadar on a cycle.
The circumstantial evidence in the case, on which the High Court has relied, may be briefly summarised as follows : (1) The second appellant, Massa Singh, who was arrested on the 18th December, 1948, was wearing a pyjama stained with human blood.
(2) The third appellant, Swaran Singh, who was arrested on the 18th December, 1948, took the police on the 19th December to his haveli which was locked, and, on opening it two kheses (wrappers) which were stained with human blood were recovered.
(3) Swaran Singh pointed out a spot on the way to Saki nala, where the two dead bodies were placed for a short time while they were being taken to Sakinala, and the police scrapped blood stained earth from that spot.
He also led the police to the bank of Sakinala and pointed out the trunk of the body of Darshan Singh which was lying in the nala.
(4) Lachhman Singh, who was arrested on the 28th Decem ber, 1948, pointed out a dilapidated khola near Sakinala where 3 spears, one kirpan and a datar, all stained with human blood, were recovered.
The learned Sessions Judge, who heard the evidence, seems to have been impressed by the evidence of the eye witnesses, and he has summed up his conclusion in these words : ""This evidence was so consistent, so reliable, and of such nature that in my opinion it is definitely established that the five accused Lachhman Singh, Katha 844 Singh, Massa, Singh, Charan Singh and Swaran Singh are proved to have actually murdered both Darshan Singh and Achhar Singh.
This fact is further proved from subsequent events as deposed by P.W. 8 Bahadur Singh and P.W. 9 Gian Singh and P.W. 11 Bhagwan Singh.
These witnesses had wit nessed the various recoveries in this case which were made at the instance of all the accused.
"" The learned Judges of the High Court, though they re pelled most of the criticisms levelled against the witness es, ultimately came to the conclusion that ""in all the circumstances (of the case) it would be proper not to rely upon the oral evidence implicating particular accused unless there is some circumstantial evidence to support it"".
Having laid down this standard, they examined the circum stantial evidence against each of the accused persons and upheld the conviction of the three appellants on the ground that the circumstantial evidence, to which reference has been made, was sufficient corroboration of the oral evi dence.
The case of the appellants was argued at great length by Mr. Sethi, who appeared for them, and everything that could possibly be said in their favour was urged by him with great force and clarity.
Proceeding, however, upon the principles laid down by this court, circumscribing the scope of a criminal appeal after the case has been sifted by the trial court and the High Court, it seems to us that the question involved in the present appeal is a short and simple one.
According to our reading of the judgment of the High Court, the learned Judges, who dealt with the case, did not condemn the oral evidence outright, but, as a matter of prudence and caution, they decided not to convict an accused person unless there were some circumstances to lend support to the evidence of the eye witnesses with regard to him.
It is quite clear on reading the judgment that the corroboration which the learned judges required to satisfy themselves was not that kind of corroboration which one requires in the case of the evidence of an approver or an accomplice, 845 but corroboration by some circumstances which would lend assurance to the evidence before them and satisfy them that the particular accused persons were really concerned in the murder of the deceased.
Judged by this standard, which it was open to them to prescribe, it seems to us that the case of each of the appellants clearly fell within the rule which they had laid down for their own guidance.
The comment of the learned counsel for the appellants with regard to the blood stained pyjama which was recovered from Massa Singh was, firstly, that it was not possible to gather from the evidence the extent of the blood stains, and secondly that it would be highly improbable that this ac cused person would be so reckless as to continue to wear a blood stained pyjama after having perpetrated the crime.
This criticism has been considered by the courts below, and it does not appear to us to be of such a nature as to affect the conclusion arrived at by them.
As to the recovery of blood stained weapons at the instance of Lachhman Singh, it was urged that the entire evidence with regard to this recovery should be discarded, as the police investigation in the case was not a straightforward one but was conducted in such a way as to raise suspicion that the police were delib erately trying to create some evidence of recovery against each of the accused persons.
It is sufficient to say that it is not the function of this court to reassess evidence and an argument on a point of fact which did not prevail with the courts below cannot avail the appellants in this court.
The comment against the discoveries made at the instance of Swaran Singh was that they are not admissible in evidence under section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act, which provides ""When any fact is deposed to as discovered in conse quence of information received from a person accused of an offence in the custody of a police officer, so much of such information, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as ' relates distinctly to the fact there.
by discovered, may be proved,"" 846 The main facts which it is necessary to state to under stand the argument on this point, may be summed up as fol lows : According to the prosecution, all the three accused, namely, Katba Singh, Massa Singh and Swaran Singh, were interrogated by the police on the morning of the 19th Decem ber, 1948, and they made certain statements which were duly recorded by the police.
In these statements, it was disclosed that the dead bodies were thrown in the Sakinala.
Thereafter, the police party with the three accused went to Sakinala where each of them pointed out a place where dif ferent parts of the dead bodies were discovered.
The learned counsel for the appellants cited a number of rulings in which section 27 has been construed to mean that it is only the information which is first given that is admissible and once a fact has been discovered in conse quence of information received from a person accused of an offence, it cannot be said to be re discovered in conse quence of information received from another accused person.
It was urged before us that the prosecution was bound to adduce evidence to prove as to which of the three accused gave the information first.
The head constable, who record ed the statements of the three accused has not stated which of them gave the information first to him, but Bahadur Singh, one of the witnesses who attested the recovery memos, was specifically asked in cross examination about it and stated: ""I cannot say from whom information was got first"".
In the circumstances, it was contended that since it cannot be ascertained which of the accused first gave the informa tion, the alleged discoveries cannot be proved against any of the accused persons.
It seems to us that if the evidence adduced by the prosecution is found to be open to suspicion and it appears that the police have deliberately attributed similar confessional statements relating to facts discovered to different accused persons, in order to create evidence against all of them, the case Undoubtedly demands a most cautious approach.
847 But as to what should be the rule when there is clear and unimpeachable evidence as to independent and authentic statements of the nature referred to in section 27 of the Evidence Act, having been made by several accused persons, either simultaneously or otherwise, all that we wish to say is that as at present advised we are inclined to think that some of the eases relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants have perhaps gone farther than is warranted by the language of section 27, and it may be that on a suitable occasion in future those cases may have to be reviewed.
For the purpose of this appeal, however, it is sufficient to state that even if the argument put forward on behalf of the appellants.
which apparently found favour with the High Court, is correct, the discoveries made at the instance of Swaran Singh cannot be ruled out of consideration.
It may be that several of the accused gave information to the police that the dead bodies could be recovered in the Sakinala, which is a stream running over several miles, but such an indefinite information could not lead to any discov ery unless the accused followed it up by conducting the police to the actual spot where parts of the two bodies were recovered.
From the evidence of the head constable as well as that of Bahadur Singh, it is quite clear that Swaran Singh led the police via Salimpura to a particular spot on Sakinala, and it was at his instance that blood stained earth was recovered from a place outside the village, and he also pointed out the trunk of the body of Darshan Singh.
The learned judges of the High Court were satisfied, as appears from their judgment, that his was ""the initial pointing out"" and therefore the case was covered even by the rule which, according to the counsel for the appellants, is the rule to be applied in the present case.
The learned counsel for the appellants pointed out that the doctor who performed the post mortem examination of the corpses, found partially digested rice in the stomach of the two deceased persons, and he 110 848 urged that from this it would be inferred that the occurrence must have taken place sometime at night after the deceased persons had taken their evening meals together.
This argument again raises a question of fact which the High Court has not omitted to consider.
It may however be stated that a reference to books on medical jurisprudence shows that there are many factors affecting one 's digestion, and cases were cited before us in which rice was not fully digested even though considerable time had elapsed since the last meal was taken.
There are also no data before us to show when the two deceased persons took their last meal, and what article of food, if any, was taken by them along with rice.
The finding of the doctor therefore does not neces sarily affect the prosecution case as to the time of occur rence.
It was also contended that there being no charge under section 302 read with section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, the conviction of the appellants under section 302 read with section 149 could not have been altered by the High Court to one under section 302 read with section 34, upon the acquit tal of the remaining accused persons.
The facts of the case are however such that the accused could have been charged alternatively, either under section 302 read with section 149 or under section 302 read with section 34.
The point has therefore no force.
In our opinion, there is no ground for interfering with the judgment of the courts below, and we accordingly dismiss this appeal and uphold the conviction and sentence of the appellants.
We however wish to endorse the opinion of the High Court that having regard to the gruesome nature of the crime, the sentence imposed by the Additional Sessions Judge was inappropriate and his reasons for imposing the lighter penalty are wholly inadequate.
Appeal dismissed.
Agent for the appellant : R.N. Sachthey.
","Three persons K, M and S, who were accused of murder made statements to the police which disclosed that the dead bodies after being dismembered were thrown into a stream and the police party thereafter went with the three accused to the stream where each of them pointed out a place where different 109 840 parts of the dead bodies were discovered.
It was contended on behalf of the accused that it was only the information which was first given that was admissible under sec.
27 of the Evidence Act, that once a fact has been discovered in consequence of information received from a person accused of an offence, it cannot be said to be re discovered in consequence of information received from another accused person, and that in the absence of evidence to show which of the accused first gave the information the discoveries alleged cannot be proved against any of the accused persons: Held, that, even assuming that this argument was correct, as it appeared from the evidence that S led the police to a particular spot on the stream and it was at his instance that some blood stained earth was recovered from a place outside the village and he had also pointed out the trunk of one of the dead bodies, and the High Court was satisfied that there was an ""initial pointing out"" by S, the case was covered by the rule and the evidence as to the discoveries was admissible.
With regard to the rule applicable to cases where there is clear and unimpeachable evidence as to independent and authentic statements of the nature referred to in sec.
27 of the Evidence Act having been made by several accused persons either simultaneously or otherwise, some of the decided cases have gone further than is warranted by the language of sec.
27 of the Evidence Act and may have to be reviewed on a future occasion.

Appeal by special leave from the Judgment dated the 10th April.
1951, of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla (Kapur J.) in Civil Revision No. 286 of 1950 arising out of Order dated the 24th March, 1950, of the Court of Subordinate Judge, 1st Class, Delhi, in an Application under Section 33 of Indian Arbitration Act, X of 1940.
Rattan Lal Chawla (K. N. Agarwal, with him) for the appellant.
Som Nath Chopra for the respondent.
February 25.
The Judgment of the court was deliv ered by FAZL ALI J.
This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the Punjab High Court upholding the decision of a Subordinate Judge of Delhi relating to a petition filed by the appellant company under section 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act against the respondents, 503 The material facts are these.
On the 22nd April, 1947, the appellant company insured a car belonging to the first respondent and issued a policy which fully sets out the terms and conditions of the agreement relating to the insur ance.
The first respondent left his car in a garage at Lahore and came away to India on the 31st July, 1947.
Subsequently, he learned about the loss of his car, and sent a legal notice dated the 18th March, 1948, through his advocate Mr. A.R. Kapur to the Head Office of the company at Calcutta, claiming a sum of Rs. 7,000 for the loss of the car.
On the 10th April, 1948, Mr. Kapur received a letter from the Branch Manager of the Company 's office at Amrit sar asking for information regarding certain matters stated in the letter.
This information appears to have been sup plied on the 30th April, 1948.
On the 26th May, 1948, the company 's Branch Manager at Amritsar wrote to the first respondent repudiating the liability of the company for the loss of the car on the ground that the loss was ""due to communal riots which were going on in the whole of Punjab"" and was not covered by the agreement of insurance.
A simi lar letter was written again by the Branch Manager on the 3rd July, 1948, to the first respondent, and another letter was written by one Mr. Rattan Lal Chawla representing him self to be counsel for the company, to Mr. A.R. Kapur, on the 1st August, 1948.
On the 21st November, 1949, the first respondent wrote a letter to the Branch Secretary of the Company 's office at Calcutta, stating that his claim was valid and nominating Mr. T.C. Chopra, Assistant Manager, Lakshmi Insurance Company Ltd., Delhi, as arbitrator on his behalf and requesting the company to appoint another person as arbitrator on its behalf.
Thereafter, the company pre sented an application on the 29th December, 1949, in the court of the Senior Sub judge, Delhi, under section 33 of the Indian Arbitration Act, against the first respondent and Mr. T.C. Chopra, the arbitrator, who is the second respond ent in this appeal, praying for 504 (1) a declaration to the effect that the reference to arbitration and the appointment of respondent No. 2 as sole arbitrator was illegal; (2) a declaration to the effect that if the respondent No. 2 made any award it would not be binding on the company;and (3) an injunction restraining the respondents Nos. 1 and 2 from taking any proceeding in the matter and the respond ent No. 2 from making any award.
Upon this petition, notice was issued to the respond ents, and an injunction was issued directing them not to file any award till the date of the next hearing, which was fixed for 31st January, 1950.
On the 4th February, 1930, the first respondent wrote to the second respondent (the arbitrator) that since no arbitrator had been appointed by the company and since the company had refused to appoint any arbitrator, he (Mr. Chopra) was to act as the sole arbitra tor.
On the 6th February, 1950, Mr. Chopra wrote to inform the insurance company that he had been appointed sole arbi trator and asked the company to send the statement of its case and to produce all the evidence on the 14th February, 1950.
On the 10th February, 1950, the insurance company filed a petition before the Subordinate Judge, Delhi, pray ing that the respondents be stopped from proceeding further in the matter so that its application under section 33 may not become infructuous.
On the 11th February, the Subordi nate Judge issued notice to the respondents fixing the 17th February as the date of hearing and passed the following order: ""Moreover (till) the decision of this application the arbitrator should not give or pronounce his award but should continue the proceedings.
"" On the 14th February, 1950, the second respondent pronounced his award after making a note to the following effect: "" Mr. G.R. Chopra, the counsel of the defendants, sent a telephonic message at 12 A.M. requesting extension till 1 P.M.
I agreed and accordingly I waited for 505 him and the plaintiff with his counsel also waited up to 1 P.M.
Nobody turned up on behalf of the defendants.
I commenced the proceedings and took the statement of the plaintiff and the documents that he had produced."" He made a further note at the end of the award to this effect : ""As after the giving of the award a notice was served upon me not to give the award, I have not sent any formal letter to the parties informing them of the award and its costs.
"" On the 24th March, 1950, the Subordinate Judge passed an order on the company 's application under section 33, dis missing it and holding that the terms of clause 7 of the agreement ""were comprehensive enough to include the points of disputes between the parties now and as such are triable by the arbitrator and not by the court.
"" The Subordinate Judge concluded his order by observing: ""I, therefore, hold that the reference to the arbitra tion of the differences is perfectly valid and the points raised by the parties to this application with regard to the abandonment of claim and its becoming irrecoverable are to be decided by the arbitrator.
"" The judgment of the Subordinate Judge was upheld in revision by the Punjab High Court and the company has now preferred an appeal to this court by special leave.
The points that were urged on behalf of the appellant in this appeal are these: (1) that the arbitration clause had ceased to be opera tive and the question as to the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement was triable by the court under section 33 of the Arbitration Act and not by the arbitrator; and (2) that the award was invalid and not binding on the appellant, because it was pronounced in spite of the order of the court dated the 11th February, 1950, directing the arbitrator not to pronounce his award.
506 Clause 7 of the policy of insurance rims as follows : ""All differences arising out of this policy shall be referred to the decision of an arbitrator to be appointed in writing by the parties in difference or if they cannot agree upon a single arbitrator to the decision of two arbi trators one to be appointed in writing by each of the parties within one calendar month after having been required in writing so to do by either of the parties or in case the arbitrators do not agree of an umpire appointed in writing by the arbitrators before entering upon the reference.
The umpire shall sit with the arbitrators and preside at their meeting and the making of an award shall be a condition precedent to any right of action against the company.
if the company shall disclaim liability to the insured for any claim hereunder and such claim shall not within twelve calendar months from the date of such disclaimer have been referred to arbitration under the provisions herein con tained then the claim shall for all purposes be deemed to have been abandoned and shall not thereafter be recoverable hereunder.
"" It will be noticed that this clause provides among other things that if the company disclaimed liability to the insured for any claim under the policy and such claim was not within twelve calender months from the date of such disclaimer referred to arbitration, then the claim should be deemed to have been abandoned and was not recoverable.
The case of the company is that it disclaimed liability for the loss of the car on three successive occasions, namely, on the 26th May, 1948, the 3rd July, 1948, and the 1st August, 1948.
The first respondent however did not take any action in regard to the appointment of an arbitrator until the 21st November, 1949, i.e, until more than 12 months after even the last disclaimer by the company.
For this reason, the claim put forward by the first respondent must be deemed to have been abandoned and he cannot recover anything from the company.
On the other hand.
the case of the first respond ent, which 507 is set out in.
his affidavit dated the 17th February, 1950, is that there was never any valid disclaimer by the company of its liability.
The position that he took up was that the Branch Manager of the company had no authority to disclaim the liability, and it could have been disclaimed only by a resolution of the company.
Now these being the respective contentions of the parties, the question is whether the point in dispute fell to be decided by the arbitrator or by the court under section 33 of the Arbitration Act.
Section 33 is to the following effect: ""Any party to an arbitration agreement or any person claiming under him desiring to challenge the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement or an award or to have the effect of either determined shall apply to the Court and the Court shall decide the question on affidavits: Provided that where the Court deems it just and expedi ent, it may set down the application for hearing on other evidence also.
and it may pass such orders for discovery and particulars as it may do in a suit.
"" The question to be decided is whether the point on which the parties are in dispute is a difference ""arising out of the policy"" in terms of clause 7 of the policy.
The test for determining such a question has been laid down in a series of cases and is a simple one.
The test is whether recourse to the contract by which the parties are bound is necessary for the purpose of determining the matter in dispute between them.
If such recourse to the contract is necessary.
then the matter must come within the scope of the arbitrator 's jurisdiction.
In the present case, both the parties admit the contract and state that they are bound by it.
Indeed, the appellant company, in order to make good its contention, is obliged to rely and does rely on that part of clause 7 of the policy which states that if the company should disclaim liability and the claim be not referred to arbitration within 12 months of such disclaimer, the claim shall be deemed to have been abandoned.
Evidently, the company cannot succeed without calling in aid this clause and 508 relying on it.
Again, the first respondent does not say that he is not bound by the clause but states that the matter was referred to arbitration before any valid disclaimer was made.
The position therefore is that one party relying upon the arbitration clause says that there has been a breach of its terms and the other party, also relying on that clause, says that there has been no breach but on the other hand the requirements of that clause have been fulfilled.
Thus, the point in dispute between the parties is one for the decision of which the appellant is compelled to invoke to his aid one of the terms of the insurance agreement.
It is thus clear that the difference between the parties is a difference arising out of the policy and the arbitrator had jurisdic tion to decide it, the parties having made him the sole judge of all differences arising out of the policy.
A large number of cases were cited before us on behalf of the parties, but it is unnecessary to refer to them, since the question which arises in this appeal is a simple one and is covered by the statement of law which is to be found in the decision of this Court in A.M. Mair & Co. vs Gordhandass Sagarmull C), and in a series of English author ities, some of which only may be referred to.
In Heyman vs Darwins, Ltd. (2) the law on the subject has been very clearly stated in the following passage : ""An arbitration clause is a written submission, agreed to by the parties to the contract, and, like other written submissions to arbitration, must be construed according to its language and in the light of the circumstances in which it is made.
If the dispute is as to whether the contract which contains the clause has ever been entered into at all, that issue cannot go to arbitration under the clause, for the party who denies that he has ever entered into the contract is thereby denying that he has ever joined in the submission.
Similarly, if one party to the alleged contract is contending that it is void ab initio (because, for exam ple, the making of such a contract is illegal)the arbitra tion (1)[1950] S.C.R. 792.
(2) [1941] 1 A.E.R.337,343 509 clause cannot operate, for on this view the clause ' itself is also void.
however, the parties are at one in asserting that they entered into a binding contract, but a difference has arisen between them as to whether there has been a breach by one side or the other, or as to whether circumstances have arisen which have discharged one or both parties from fur ther performance, such differences should be regarded as differences which have arisen 'in respect of, ' or 'with regard to, ' or 'under ' the contract, and an arbitration clause which uses these, or similar expressions, should be construed accordingly.
"" In Macaura vs Northern Assurance Co. (1), the appellant had insured a large quantity of timber against fire and the greater part of the timber having been de stroyed by fire, he sued the insurance company to recover the loss but the action was stayed and the matter was re ferred to arbitration in pursuance of the conditions con tained in the policy.
The arbitrator held that the claimant had no insurable interest in the goods insured and disal lowed the claim.
One of the points raised in the case was that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to decide the mat ter, but that contention was rejected by Lord Sumner in these words: ""The defendants do not repudiate the policy or dispute its validity as a contract; on the contrary, they rely on it and say that according to its terms, express and implied, they are, relieved from liability: see Stebbing 's case(2), Woodall vs Pearl Assurance Co.(3).
It is a Fallacy to say that they assert the policy to be null and void."" In Stebbing vs Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company Limited(2), to which reference was made by Lord Summer, the policy of insurance contained a clause referring to the decision of an arbitrator ""all differences arising out of this policy "".
It also (1) (3) , (2) , 66 510 contained a recital that the assured had made a proposal and declaration as the basis of the contract, and a clause to the effect that compliance with the conditions indorsed upon the policy should be a condition precedent to any liability on the part of the insurers.
One of the conditions provided that if any false declaration should be made or used in support of a claim all benefit under the policy should be forfeited.
In answer to a claim by the assured, the insurers alleged that statements in the proposal and declaration were false.
When the matter came before the arbitrator, the assured objected that this was not a difference in the arbitration and that the arbitrator had no power to deter mine whether the answers were true or not, or to determine any matters which called in question the validity of the policy.
In holding that the arbitrator had jurisdiction to decide the matter, Viscount Reading C.J. observed as fol lows: "" If the company were seeking to avoid the contract in the true sense they would have to rely upon some matter outside the contract, such as a misrepresentation of some material fact inducing the contract, of which the force and effect are not declared by the contract itself.
In that case the materiality of the fact and its effect in inducing the contract would have to be tried.
In the present case the company are claiming the benefit of a clause in the contract when they say that the parties have agreed that the statements in question are material and that they induced the contract.
If they succeed in escaping liability that is by reason of one of the clauses in the policy.
In resisting the claim they are not avoiding the policy but relying on its terms.
In my opinion, therefore, the question whether or not the statement is true is a question arising out of the policy.
"" The main contention put forward on behalf of the appel lant is that the points in dispute fall outside the juris diction of the arbitrator, firstly because the existence of the arbitration agreement is challenged, and secondly, because the sole object of the application under section 33 of the Arbitration Act is tO have the 511 effect of the arbitration agreement determined.
In our opinion, neither of these objections is sound.
How can it be held that the existence of the arbitration agreement is challenged, when both parties admit that the clause in the policy which contains that agreement binds them.
It is neither party 's case that there is no arbitration agreement in the policy.
On the ,:other hand, both parties admit that such agreement exists, and each of them relies on it to support its case.
It is true that the appellant contends that the arbitration agreement has ceased to be applicable, but that contention cannot be sustained without having recourse to the arbitration agreement.
It is said that the agreement no longer subsists,but that is very different from saying that the agreement never existed or was void ab initio and therefore is to be treated as non existent.
Again, no question of determining the effect of the arbitration agreement arises, because there is no dispute between the parties as to what it means.
The language of the arbitration clause is quite clear, and both,parties construe it in the same way.
The real question between them is whether the first respondent has or has not complied with the conditions of the agreement.
But this question does not turn on the effect of the agreement.
This is the view which has substantially been taken by the High Court, and in our opinion it is correct.
The second point urged before us is that the award is invalid, since it was made in spite of the court 's injunc tion directing the arbitrator not to pronounce any award.
This point however does not, in our opinion, fall within the scope of this appeal.
The application under section 33 of the Arbitration Act, which is the subject of this appeal, was filed before the award was pronounced.
In that applica tion, there is no reference to the award; nor is there any reference to the circumstances which are now stated to invalidate the award and which happened after the applica tion was filed.
The learned counsel for the appellant made an application before us praying for the amendment of the petition under section 38 by introducing certain 512 additional facts and adding a prayer for declaring the award to be invalid, but it was rejected/by us.
It should be stated that as early as the 24th March, 1950, the Subordi nate Judge in dismissing the appellant 's petition under section 33, made the following observations : ""During the pendency of the arbitration proceedings the arbitrator pronounced the award. .
The award has now been filed in the court of section Mohinder Singh, Sub Judge, 1st class, Delhi.
Any objection against the award can be filed there.
In this application in which there is no prayer for setting aside the award, which exists, I do not think it proper to decide the question of the validity of the award.
"" In our opinion, the Subordinate Judge correctly indi cated the course which it was open to the appellant in law to adopt for the purpose of questioning the validity of the award, but not having taken that course and not having made any application in the courts below for amending the petition under section 33, the company cannot ask this court to go into the validity of the award by widening the scope of the original petition.
This court is always in favour of shortening litigation, but it would be a very unusual step to allow the petition under section 33 to be amended now and to decide a question involving investigation of facts with out having the benefit of the judgments of the courts below.
In the result, the appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
Agent for respondent No. 1.: S.D. Sekhri.
","The appellant company insured a car belonging to re spondent No. 1 and issued a policy which contained, inter alia, the following terms : ""All differences arising out of this policy shall be referred to the decision of an arbitra tor to be appointed by the parties. .
If the company shall disclaim liability to the insured for any claim here under and such claim shall not within twelve calendar months from the date of such disclaimer have been referred to arbitration then the claim shall have been deemed to have been abandoned and shall not be recoverable.
"" The car was lost, and the company through its Branch Manager disclaimed liability on three different dates.
The insured did not take any action in regard to the appointment of an arbitra tor until more than twelve months after the last disclaimer by the company.
The case of the company was that the in sured must be deemed to have abandoned his claim by virtue of the contract of insurance policy while 'the respondent averred that there was never any valid disclaimer by the company of its liability as the Branch Manager had no au thority to disclaim the liability and it could have been disclaimed only by the resolution of the company.
The company presented the present application under see.
33 of the Indian Arbitration Act praying for a declaration that the reference to arbitration was illegal and the award if made by the arbitrator would not bind the company.
It was contended on its behalf that the arbitration clause had ceased to be 65 502 operative and the question as to the existence and validity of the Arbitration agreement was triable by the court under sec.
33 of the Arbitration Act and not by the arbitrator.
Held, (i) that the point on which the parties were in dispute was a difference ""arising out of the policy "", because recourse to the contract by which both the parties were bound was necessary for the purpose of determining the matter in dispute between them as there was no contention raised in the present case by either of the parties that there was no contract entered into at all or that it was void ab initio, and therefore the arbitrator had jurisdic tion to decide the matter referred to him.
A contention that the arbitration agreement has ceased to be applicable or that it no longer subsists will not oust the jurisdiction of the arbitrator.
(ii) No question of determining the effect of the arbitra tion within the meaning of sec.
33 arose because there was no dispute between the parties as to what it meant.

Bakshi Tek Chand, (Gopal Singh, with him) for the appellant.
section K. Kapoor, for the respondent.
March 4.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.
The appellant Kashmira Singh has been convicted of the murder of one Ramesh, a small boy aged five, and has been sentenced to death.
He was granted special leave to appeal.
Three other persons were tried along with him.
They were his brother Gurudayal singh, his nephew Pritipalsingh (son of Gurudayal), a boy of eleven, and one Gurubachan singh.
Gurudayal and pritipal have been acquitted.
Guruba chansingh confessed and was convicted.
He was also sentenced to death.
He has not appealed here.
The murder was a particularly cruel and revolting one and for that reason it will be necessary to examine the evidence with more than ordinary care lest the shocking nature of the crime induce an instinctive reaction against a dispassionate judicial scrutiny of the facts and law.
The prosecution case is this.
The deceased Ramesh was the son of P.W. 48 L.P. Tiwari who was the Food Officer at Gondia at the relevant date.
The appellant Kashmira Singh was an Assistant Food Procurement Inspector there.
On the 1st of July, 1949, Tiwari found the appellant and Harbilas (P.W. 31) getting rice polished at a certain rice mill.
At that date the polishing of rice was prohibited by a State law.
Tiwari accordingly reported the matter to the Deputy Commissioner of Bhandara.
He suspended the 528 appellant and later his services were terminated by an order of the State Government with effect from the 7th of July.
The orders were communicated on the 17th of November.
This embittered the appellant who on at least two occasions was heard to express a determination to be revenged.
In pursuance of this determination he got into touch with the confessing accused Gurubachan singh and enlisted his services for murdering the boy Ramesh.
On the 26th of December, 1949, festivities and religious ceremonies were in progress all day in the Sikh Gurudwara at Gondia.
The boy Ramesh was there in the morning and from there was enticed to the house of the appellant 's brother Gurudayalsingh and was done to death in a shockingly revolt ing fashion by the appellant, with the active assistance of Gurubachansingh, in the middle of the day at about 12 or 12 30.
The body was then tied up in a gunny bag and rolled up in a roll of bedding and allowed to lie in Gurudayal 's house till about 7 p.m.
At 7 p.m. the body wrapped as above was carried by Gurubachan on his head to a chowkidar 's hut near the Sikh Gurudwara.
The appellant accompanied him.
The map, Exhibit P 18A, shows that the distance along the route indicated was about half a mile to three quarters of a mile.
It was left there till about midnight.
Shortly before midnight the appellant and Gurubachan engaged the services of a rickshaw coolie Shambhu alias Sannatrao, P.W. 14.
They took him to the chowkidar 's hut, recovered the bundle of bedding and went in the rickshaw to a well which appears from the map, Exhibit 1 ' 18A, to be about half a mile distant.
There the body was thrown into the well. ]hat in brief is the prosecution ease.
Gurubachan 's confession has played an important part in implicating the appellant, and the question at once arises, how far and in what way the confession of an accused person can be used against a co accused ?
It is evident that it is not evidence in the ordinary 529 sense of the term because, as the Privy Council say in Bhuboni Sahu vs The King(1) ""It does not indeed come within the definition of"" 'evidence ' contained in section 3 of the Evidence Act.
, It is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused, and it cannot be tested by crossexamination.
"" Their Lordships also point out that it is ""obviously evidence of a very weak type. .
It is a much weaker type of evidence than the evidence of an approv er, which is not subject to any of those infirmities.
"" They stated in addition that such a confession cannot be made tile foundation of a conviction and can only be used in ""support of other evidence.""
In view of these remarks it would be pointless to cover the same ground, but we feet it is necessary to expound this further as misapprehension still exists.
The question is, in what way can it be used in support of other evidence ? Can it be used to fill in miss ing gaps ? Can it be used to corroborate an accomplice or, as in the present case, a witness who, though not an accom plice, is placed in the same category regarding credibility because the judge refuses to believe him except in so far as he is corroborated ? In our opinion, the matter was put succinctly by Sir 'Lawrence Jenkins in Emperor vs Lalit Mohan Chuckerbutty(2) where he said that such a confession can only be used to ""lend assurance to other evidence against a co accused ""or, to put it in another way, as Reilly J. did in In re Periyas wami Moopan(3) ""the provision goes no further than this where there is evidence against the co accused sufficient, if believed, to support his conviction, then the kind of confession de scribed in section 30 may be thrown into the scale as an additional reason for believing that evidence.""

530 Translating these observations into concrete terms they come to.
The proper way to approach a case of this kind is, first, to marshal the evidence against the accused excluding the confession altogether from consideration and see whether, if it is believed, a conviction could safely be based on it.
If it is capable of belief independently of the confession, then of course it is not necessary to call the confession in aid.
But cases may arise where the judge is not prepared to act on the other evidence as it stands even though, if believed, it would be sufficient to sustain a conviction.
In such an event the judge may call in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other evi dence and thus fortify himself in believing what without the aid of the confession he would not be prepared to accept.
Then, as regards its use in the corroboration of accom plices and approvers.
A co. accused who confesses is natu rally an accomplice and the danger of using the testimony of one accomplice t0 corroborate another has repeatedly been pointed out.
The danger is in no way lessened when the ""evidence"" is not on oath and cannot be tested by cross examination.
Prudence will dictate the same rule of caution in the case of a witness who though not an accomplice is regarded by the judge as having no greater probative value.
But all these are only rules of prudence.
So far as the law is concerned, a conviction can be based on the uncorroborat ed testimony of an accomplice provided the judge has the rule of caution, which experience dictates, in mind and gives reasons why he thinks it would be safe in a given case to disregard it.
Two of us bad occasion to examine this recently in Rameshwar vs The State of Rajasthan(1).
It follows that the testimony of an accomplice can in law be used to corroborate another though it ought not to be so used save in exceptional circumstances and for reasons disclosed.
As the Privy Council observe in Bhuboni Sahu vs The King(2): ""The tendency to include the innocent with the guilty is peculiarly prevalent in India, as judges have (1) ; (2) (1949) 76 I A.147 at 157.
531 noted on innumerable occasions, and it is very difficult for the court to guard against the danger. .
The only real safeguard against the risk of condemning the innocent with the guilty lies in insisting on independent evidence which in some measure implicates such accused.
"" Turning now to the facts of the present case.
The evidence on which the prosecution relies, apart from the confession, is this : (1) Previous association between Gurubachan and the appellant.
The only evidence about this is P.W. 23 Upasrao, a water carrier.
He speaks of three meetings and is curiously definite about days of the week and times though he did not know on what day of the week diwali fell nor could he give the names of anybody else he met on those occasions.
Howev er, for what it is worth.
he says he saw them talking (1) three weeks before the murder, (v) on the 24th and (3) on the 25th.
They spoke in Punjabi which he does not under stand, but on the second occasion he heard them mention the name of Ramesh.
Two of these meetings, namely the first and the third tally with two of the only three meetings de scribed in the confession.
It is proved that the witness did not disclose these facts to the police but despite that the Sessions Judge believed him because of the confession.
The High Court appear to have disbelieved him, for in paragraph 37 of the judgment the learned judges point out that he is contradicted by his own statement to the police.
There his story was that the three brothers met and not Gurubachan and the appellant.
This evidence can therefore be disregarded and consequently the confession cannot be used to prove previous association.
It was argued however that if it is proved that the appellant helped in disposing of the body after the murder, then their previous association can be inferred because one would hardly seek the assistance of a stranger for a task like that.
That has some force but the weakness of that in this case lies on the fact that, 532 according to the prosecution case, as disclosed in the confession, Gurubachan was a stranger to Gondia.
i He had come there only six weeks before the murder and did not meet the appellant till three weeks later and then only casually.
Their second meeting, equally casual, was on the 21st, that is, five days before the murder, and on that date the appel lant is said to have disclosed his intention to this strang er whom he had only met once before.
It is true this strang er knew the appellant 's brother, but how ?
The brother was a travelling ticket inspector on the railway and used to allow Gurubachan to travel without a ticket, presumably because he was also a Sikh.
If probabilities are to be called in aid, the story disclosed in the confession has distinct weakness es, particularly as Gurubachan 's assistance was wholly unnecessary.
If the confession is true there was a well thought out plot timed with the precision almost of a minor military operation.
At a given moment the nephew Pritipal was to decoy the deceased away from his companions and isolate him.
Then, after leading him several hundred yards down the road, hand him over to Gurubachan.
Gurubachan was to take him down to point No. 6 on the map well over half a mile from the spot where he took over from Pritipal.
In the meanwhile, the appellant was to walk another half mile at right angles to Gurubachan 's course to the point No. 15 to hire a cycle.
From there he was to cycle close on a mile to point No. 6 and meet Gurubachan and the boy.
As the learned High Court Judges, who made a spot inspection, point out, the route would lie through a crowded bazaar locality.
From point No. 6 Gurubachan was to hand over the child to the appellant who was to cycle with him close on a mile to his brother Gurudayal 's quarters, point No. 16, through this same crowded bazaar.
In the meanwhile, Gurubachan was to walk back to his house (No. 17) and pick up a chisel and a piece of wire for the purpose of the murder and rejoin the appellant at Gurudayal 's house.
As will be seen, the timing would have to be within fairly close tolerances.
Then, at the murder itself, what 533 assistance did Gurubachan give ?
Nothing which a grown man could not easily have accomplished him self on a small helpless victim of five.
The appellant could have accomplished all this as easily without the assistance of Gurubachan, and equally Gurubachan, a mere hired assassin, could have done it all himself without the appellant running the risk of drawing pointed attention to himself as having been last seen in the company of the boy.
We hold that previous association of a type which would induce two persons to associate together for the purposes of a murder is not established.
(2) That the deceased Ramesh was in the Gurudwara about 9 30 or 10 in the morning of the 26th.
This is not disputed.
(3) That Kashmira Singh who had gone to the Gurudwara in the morning was absent between 11 A.M. and 12 45 P.M.
That the appellant was at the Gurudwara in the morning is not disputed, in fact his case is that he was there the entire day.
The evidence to prove that he left it between these hours consists of three persons: P.W. 30 Atmaram, P.W. 35 Tilakchand and P.W. 5 Bisan.
The prosecution story is that the appellant left the Gurudwara about 11 A.M. to go to the shop of P.W. 5 Bisan to hire a cycle.
He was first seen by P.W. 35 Tilakehand, a wood stall keeper, at point No. 13, just near the Gurudwara.
The witness places the time at about 10 30 or 11 A.M.
He says he saw him coming from the direction of the railway station and going past his stall.
Fifteen minutes later, he went past his stall again in the opposite direction, that is to say, towards the railway station which lies on his way to the cycle shop.
Next comes P.W. 30 Atmaram He keeps a bookstall on the broad gauge platform of the Gondia Railway Station.
He says he saw the appellant coming from the bridge and going to wards the Railway Police 69 534 Station of all places in the world.
He came near ,enough the witness to wish him good day.
He places 'the time at about 10 30 or 11.
The only comment we make on this witness is that he says he used to see the appellant at the station almost every day and they used to greet each other.
The possibility that the witness is mixing up this day with one of the other days cannot be excluded.
It is certainly a matter for comment that a would be murderer on his way to hire a cycle for the purpose and keep an assignment with his accomplice and victim should go out of his way and either go on to or very near the railway platform to greet a person he knows there and then walk away towards the police station of all places where the danger of recognition would be strong.
Next there is P.W. 5 Bisan, the man in charge of the cycle shop.
He speaks from his register and says the appel lant hired a cycle from him on that day at 11 20 A.M. and returned it at 12 45 P.M.
The Sessions Judge and the High Court lay great stress on this witness.
But as against this is the evidence of Anupsingh Bedi, D.W. 1, a respectable disinterested witness, who is a resi dent of Nagpur.
He says he saw the appellant at the Gurudwa ra at 11 and again ""about 11 45 A.M."" The sessions Judge thought he was interested because he admits he reported a complaint he had received from Gurudayalsingh, to the effect that the appellant was being harassed by the police and that they threatened to arrest ladies also, to the Inspector General of Police and the Home Minister.
He explained that as head of the Sikh community in that State he felt bound to pass on these complaints to the highest authorities.
We are unable to regard this as disclosing interest.
There is no suggestion that what he did was improper and we are of opinion he did nothing more than any man of responsibility in his position would have done.
The High Court has not criticised him.
The learned Judges merely say that he may be mistaken as to the time; nor of course does he suggest that he is giving more than a mere estimate.
All he 535 says is that, ""It may have been about 11 45 A.M. by this time.
"" We do not think there is much in all this.
Nobody, except P.W. 5 Bisan, pretends to be exact and when one is guessing at the time several days after the event there really is not much discrepancy between 11 20 and 11 45.
Even if it was 11 45 there would still have been sufficient time to commit the murder.
As two Courts have believed the evi dence on this point without calling in aid the confession, we are not prepared to depart from our usual rule regarding concurrent findings of fact.
We will therefore accept the position that the appellant was absent from the Gurudwara long enough to enable him to commit the murder.
We will also take into consideration the fact that he made a false statement on this point when he said he was not away at all.
(4) Disposal of the body.
The rest of the evidence relates to the disposal of the body and the only direct evidence connecting the appellant with this, apart from the confession, is that of Sannatrao P.W. 14, the rickshaw coolie.
He does not bring the appellant into the picture till about midnight.
Now this coolie is a very shaky witness.
We cannot but note the remarkable series of coincidences which emerge from his testimony.
First, he is not a rickshaw coolie at all.
He merely hap pened to hire a rickshaw that night, and he told the police that this was the first time he had ever done that at night after.
a day 's work.
Next, he knew the appellant because he happened to be a chowkidar in the Food Office at Gondia at the same time that the appellant was there as a Food Inspec tor.
But at the date of the incident neither was still in service, so by a somewhat strange coincidence the appellant happens to hire, for the first time, this old co worker in the middle of the night who, in his turn, happened to hire, also for the first time at night, a rickshaw for which he had no licence.
Next comes a still stranger coincidence.
He is taken to within a few paces of his own house and the body 536 is dumped, in his presence, into a welt, a stone 's throw from where he lives.
Gurubachan tells us that earlier in the day, about 7 P.M., he (Gurubachan) had carried, unaided, the ""bedding"" on his head for a distance which we know was hail to three quarters of a mile, namely from Gurudayal 's house to the chowkidar 's hut.
Despite this, the two are said to have engaged this rickshaw coolie to carry it just hall a mile (a shorter distance) to the well and there they threw it in in the man 's presence; and none of this was disclosed to the police till a month later, namely the 17th of January, though the witness was present when the body was recovered and though he was questioned on three previous occasions.
We do not doubt that a rickshaw was used because rick shaw tracks were discovered by the well long before anybody had suggested that a rickshaw had been used.
But we find it difficult to resist the inference that this witness was an accomplice so far as the disposal of the body was concerned.
Consequently, he is in much the same category so far as credibility is concerned, That brings us at once to the rule that save in exceptional circumstances one accomplice cannot be used to corroborate another, nor can he be used to corroborate a person who though not an accomplice is no more reliable than one.
We have therefore either to seek corrobo ration of a kind which will implicate the appellant apart from the confession or find strong reasons for using Guruba chan 's confession for that purpose.
Of course, against Gurubachan there is no difficulty, but against the appellant the position is not as easy.
We will therefore examine the reliability of Guruba chan 's confession against the appellant.
Now there are some glaring irregularities regarding this confession and though it was safe for the Sessions Judge and the High Court to act on it as against Gurubachan because he adhered to it throughout the sessions trial despite his pleader 's efforts to show the contrary, a very different position emerges when we come to the appellant.
537 The first point which emerges regarding this is that the confession was not made till the 25th of February 1950, that is to say, not until two months after the murder.
We do not know when Gurubachan was first interrogated but P.W. 42 Narayandas tells us that when he was taken to the police station house at Gondia for interrogation about the 1st or 3rd January he saw Gurubachan sitting in the police lock up.
We do not know how long he was kept there like this but it is evident that he was not there voluntari ly, at any rate till the 1st or 3rd because the Station Officer P.W. 44 says that ""until Gurubachan Singh was ar rested he used to be allowed to go home.""
Also he says that Gurubachan was interrogated several times and was confronted with Pritipal.
However, eventually Gurubachan was allowed to go away and he went to Balaghat.
Then, on the 16th of February the Station Officer P.W. 44 went to Balaghat, brought Gurubachan back with him to Gondia and handed him over to the C.I.D. Inspector Guha.
Guha P.W. 50 tells us that from then till the 20th of February, when he was arrested, he was kept under observation but was allowed to go home at night.
He did not confess till the 25th and the Station Officer P.W. 44 tells us that from the 20th to the 25th he was kept in one of the rooms in Guha 's quarters.
Then, after the confes sion on the 25th he was taken back to Guha 's custody for a couple of days and then only was he sent to the magisterial lock up.
(See Guha 's evidence).
He was kept in this lock up till the conclusion of the committal proceedings, that is, till the 30th of June, instead of being sent to jail custody in Bhandara where there is a jail.
The other accused includ ing Pritipal who had by then confessed were sent to Bhanda ra.
Now though Gurubachan was kept in the magisterial lock up the distinction between the magisterial lock up and police custody in Gondia is only 538 theoretical.
In practice, it is no better than police custody.
Police constable Lalbahadur P.W. 55 tells us that ""The Station House Officer Gondia deputes constables for duty in the lock up.
The constables in charge take the prisoners out to the latrine and also arrange for their food.
The Head Constable in fact is in charge.
"" Also, Guha admits that he interrogated Gurubachan in the lock up twice within the ten days which succeeded the confession.
This is in disregard of the Rules and Orders (Criminal) of the Nagpur High Court which enjoin at page 25, paragraph 84, of the 1948 edition that ""After a prisoner has made a confession before a a magistrate he should ordinarily be committed to jail and the magistrate should note on the warrant for the information of the Superintendent of the jail that the prisoner has made a confession."" No explanation has been given why these directions, which were made for good reason, were disregarded in Guruba chan 's case.
As we have said, the other prisoners were all committed to jail custody in the usual way, so there was no difficulty about observing the rule.
All this makes it unsafe to disregard the rule about using accomplice testimo ny as corroboration against a non confessing accused.
None of the judges who have handled this ease has given any reason why this rule could safely be departed from in this particular case.
In the circumstances, we do not feel that the confession by itself can be used to corroborate the rickshaw coolie Sannatrao, P.W. 14.
But there is other corroboration.
It consists of the sari border and this is the next point on which the prosecution relies.
There is one argument about this confession advanced on behalf of the appellant with which we shall have to deal.
The prosecution were criticised for not calling the magis trate who recorded the confession as a witness.
We wish to endorse the remarks of their 539 Lordships of the Privy Council in Nazir Ahrnad vs King Emperor (1) regarding the undesirability of such a practice.
In our opinion, the magistrate was rightly not called and it would have been improper and undesirable for the prosecution to have acted otherwise.
(5) Sari borders, Articles F, G, and T. Articles F & G are two pieces of a sari border which were used for tying up the mouth of the gunny bag, in which the body was placed.
The evidence about that is beyond doubt.
Article T is another piece of a sari border which was found in the appellant 's house on the 30th or December, 1949.
It is true the appellant was not present at the time but his mother was there and it will be seen that it was seized on the same day that the body was discovered.
There is strong proof that Articles F and G are a part of the same border as Article T, and as there is a concurrent finding regarding these facts we are not prepared to to take a different view.
That therefore affords corroboration of Sannatrao 's evi dence and the confession can be called in aid to lend assur ance to the inference which arises from these facts, namely that the appellant did help to dispose of the body.
The High Court and the Sessions Judge were accordingly entitled to act on this evidence for establishing that particular fact and we are not prepared to disturb their concurrent conclusions.
But the matter cannot be carried further because, not only are the sari borders not proved to have had any connection with the crime of murder but the confes sion shows that they did not.
The only conclusion permissi ble on these facts is that the appellant, at some time which is unknown, subsequent to the murder assisted either active ly or passively in tying up the gunny bag in which the corpse was placed and that he then accompanied Gurubachan in the rickshaw from the chowkidar 's hut to the well in the middle of the night.
(6) Coat, Article X, and Safa, Article Y, (1) A.I.R. 1936 P.C. 253 at 258, 540 These were seized on the 20th of January 1950 from a trunk in the house of the appellant 's brother Gurudayalsingh.
The appellant 's house is not in this neighbourhood.
It is some distance away in another part of the town.
The coat is a uniform coat of the kind worn by a Travelling Ticket Inspector on the Railways.
Gurudayal is a travelling Ticket Inspector.
The appellant is not.
Here again the appellant was not present when the seizures were made.
This coat and safa were recovered in the fourth search.
The first search was on the 30th of December 1949.
The next on the 10th of January 1950.
The third on the morning of the 20th and the fourth in the afternoon of the 20th.
These Articles were not found in the first three searches.
The Chemical Examiner reports that there is one minute blood stain on the safa and some (the number is not given), also minute, on the coat.
The seizure memo, exhibit P 55, picked out only five.
Those stains are not proved to be of human blood.
Now there is next no evidence to connect either the coat or the safa with the appellant.
The High Court has relied on the evidence of Sannatrao (P.W. 14), Gokulprasad the Station Officer (P.W. 44) and Tiwari (P.W. 48).
Sannatrao does no more than say that he noticed the appellant wearing a popat coloured sara and a black coat.
But he was not able to describe the clothes of the passenger he had carried immediately before the appellant, nor was he able to de scribe the appellant 's coat in detail.
That therefore is no identification of this coat with the one the appellant wore or owns.
The Station Officer Gokulprasad said that he had seen the appellant wear this very coat and sara and there fore he identified them as his clothes.
In cross examina tion he admitted that he had only seen the appellant on three occasions but not to speak to.
Consequently, that is not strong evidence of identification.
But what in our opinion is almost conclusive against this identification is that Tiwari, P.W. 48, who is clearest on the point and who of course had the best opportunities for observation, 541 gives a distinctive feature of the appellant 's coat, namely that it had only one button.
That is one of his reasons for knowing what the appellant used to wear.
But the seizure memo, exhibit P. 55, shows that the coat, Article X, had two buttons.
In the circumstances we find it difficult to see how it can be the appellant 's coat.
There is another strong point in the appellant 's favour which the High Court has not noticed.
P.W. 35 the wood stall keeper Tilakchand, who saw him on his way to pick up his victim, is definite that the appellant was not wear ing a coat at the time.
It is difficult to see why he should have donned a coat and got it stained with blood just for murdering a child of five.
In our opinion, it would be unsafe to conclude on this evidence that any connection is established between the coat and the sara and the appellant.
The furthest point to which this evidence can be pushed is to indicate that the appellant possessed a coat similar to Article X but which was not Article X.
We do not ordinarily interfere with a concurrent finding of fact but when the finding omits to notice these two very important points in the accused 's favour which, in our opinion, swing the balance the other way, we are unable to let the finding stand.
In our opinion, the nexus between the appellant and the coat and the sara is not established.
(7) Motive.
This is the last piece of evidence on which the prosecution rely.
Both courts hold that the motive is established and there is strong evidence to prove it.
We accordingly accept the finding that the appellant had a motive for enmity against Tiwari and that he had expressed a determination to be revenged.
The only comment we will make is that other persons who were also dismissed from service had similar motives.
What then is the summary of the evidence ? In the appel lant 's favour there are the facts that there is no proof of his having been last seen in the company of 70 542 the deceased.
The only evidence of the boy 's movements is that of Krishna (alias Billa) P.W. 9, a boy of seven years, and all he says is that Pritipal asked him to bring Ramesh with him to the Gurudwara that morning about 9 A.M.
The boys played about and had some tea and then Pritipal took Ramesh away in the direction of the prostitute 's house.
Pritipal later returned without Ramesh.
The Sessions Judge thought this witness had been tutored on at least one point.
Pritipal 's so called confession has been rejected because, in the first place, it is not a confession at all, for it is exculpatory, and, in the next, the High Court was not able to trust it.
Therefore, the only evidence of the boy 's last movements is as above.
The next point in the appellant 's favour is that he was seen without a coat shortly before the murder and at a time when he was not in the vicinity of his own house.
According to the prosecution, the murderer wore the coat, Article X, and the sara, Article Y. The third point is that the appellant was not seen by anyone in the vicinity of the place of occurrence.
The fourth point is that if the prosecution case is true, then it is remarkable that no one saw the appellant and the boy on a cycle through nearly a mile of what the High Court, which made a spot inspection, describes as a crowded locality.
The points against the appellant are (1)that he had a motive and that he said he would be revenged, (2) that he was absent from the Gurudwara about the time of the murder long enough to enable him to commit it, and denied the fact, (3) that some twelve hours after the crime he assisted in removing the body from a place between half to three quar ters of a mile distant from the scene of the crime, and (4) that at some unknown point of time he assisted in tying up the mouth of the gunny bag in which the body was eventually placed.
In our opinion, it would be unsafe to convict of murder on these facts.
543 A number of rulings were cited, including one of the Privy Council, and it was argued that in those cases persons were convicted of murder on similar facts.
We do not intend to examine them because no decision can be a. guide on facts.
Each case has its own special circumstances and must be decided on its own facts.
For example, in most of the cases cited the accused was associated with the disposal of the body very soon after the occurrence and at the scene of the crime.
Here, twelve hours had elapsed and the first connection proved with the disposal is at a place over half a mile distant from where the boy is said to have been murdered.
Next, the points we have shown in favour of the appellant in this case were not present there.
We allow the appeal on the charges of murder, conspiracy and kidna","The confession of an accused person against a co accused is not evidence in the ordinary sense of the term.
It does not come within the meaning of evidence contained in sec.
3 of the Indian Evidence Act inasmuch as it is not required to be given on oath, nor in the presence of the accused and cannot be tested by cross examination.
It is a much weaker type of evidence than the evidence of an approver which is not subject to any of these infirmities.
Such a confession can only be used to tend assurance to other evidence against a co accused.
The proper way to approach a case of this kind is, first, to marshal the evidence against the accused excluding the confession alto gether from consideration and see whether, if it is be lieved, a conviction could safely be based on it.
If it is capable of belief independently of the confession, then it is not necessary to call the confession in aid.
But cases may arise where the judge is not prepared to act on the other evidence as it stands even though, if believed, it would be sufficient to sustain a conviction.
In such an event the judge may call in aid the confession and use it to lend assurance to the other evidence and thus fortify him self in believing what without the aid of the confession he would not be prepared to accept.

Gopi Nath Kunzru (K. B, Asthana, with him) the appel lants.
Krishna Shankar for the respondents.
April 25.
The judgment of the Court was delivered by DAs J.
This appeal arises out of an application by five out of ten judgment debtors made under section 8 of the U.P. Debt Redemption Act (No. of 1940) for ascertaining the amount due by them in accordance with the provisions of sections 9 and 10 of that Act and for amending the decree passed on March 31, 1939, by the Additional Civil Judge, Banaras, in O.S. No. 33 of 1938.
The facts materi al for the purposes of this appeal may now be briefly stated.
By a mortgage deed executed on June 22, 1922, Madho Ram, Sita Ram, Jai Ram aud Lakshman, all sons of Pandit Raja Ram Pant Sess, mortgaged cer tain immovable properties in favour of Damodarji, son of Kamta Nathji, owner of the Kothi Joshi Shivanath Vishwanath for the due repayment of the sum of Rs. 8,000 advanced on that date by a cheque together with interest thereon at 12 annas per cent per mensem with quar terly rests.
On July 28, 1931, the said mortgagors and their sons executed a mortgage over the same properties in favour of Kothi Kamta Nathji Vishwanathji for the due repayment of Rs. 3,000 with interest thereon at twelve annas per cent per mensem with quarterly rests.
It is recited in the deed that the sum of Rs. 8,000 was advanced on this date by a cheque and that the amount was utilised in paying up the amount due under the earlier 647 mortgage deed to Damodarji proprietor of Kothi Shivanath Vishwanath.
In 1935 the U.P. Agriculturists ' Relief Act (No. XXVII of 1934) came into force.
On May 1938, Girjadharji, son of Damodarji, and Murlidharji, minor son of Gangadharji who was another son of Damodarji, filed suit No. 33 of 1938 in the Court of the Additional Civil Judge, Banaras, against the mortgagors and their sons for the recovery Rs. 9,477 2 0 due as principal and interest up to date of suit and for further interest under the mortgage deed of July 28, 1931.
It appears from the judgment of the High Court under 'appeal that in their written statement the mortgagors claimed the benefit of the U.P. Agriculturists ' Relief Act (No. XXVII of 1934).
The plaintiffs contended that the mortgagors were members of a joint Hindu family and as Sita Ram one of the mortgagors was assessed to income tax the mortgagors were not agriculturists as defined in section 2 (2) of that Act and, therefore, could not claim the benefit conferred on the agriculturists by that Act.
The trial Court, by its judgment dated March 31, 1939, held that though Sita Ram was assessed to incometax for the year 1931 32, the amount of such in cometax did not exceed the amount of cess payable on the land held by him and consequently the second proviso to section 2 (2) did not apply to him and he was, therefore, an agriculturist and as the other mortgagors were also agricul turists all of them were entitled to the benefits under the Act.
Accordingly, after scaling down the interest, a sum of Rs. 9,497 14 1 was declared to be due for principal, interest and costs up to March 31, 1939, and a preliminary mortgage decree for sale was passed in that suit.
In 1940 the U.P. Debt Redemption Act (No. XIII of 1940) came into force.
On April 11, 1942, five of the judgment debtors made an application under section 8 of this Act before the Additional Civil Judge, Banaras, who passed the decree.
In the petition it was stated that the debt was actually advanced in 1922, that the petitioners were agri culturists within 648 the meaning of Act XIII of 1940, that the decreeholders can only get interest at the reduced rate of Rs. 4 8 0 per cent.
per annum from 1922, and that after adjustment of accounts nothing will be found ,outstanding against the petitioners.
The prayer was that an account of the money lending business be made from the beginning of 1922 and the decree in suit No. 33 of 1938 be modified by reducing the amount due thereunder.
The decree holders filed a petition of objection asserting, inter alia, that the petitioners were by no means agriculturists, that they and the respond ents Nos. 3 to 7 were members of a joint Hindu family at the time of the execution of the mortgage deed of July 28, 1931, that Sita Ram used to pay income tax at the date of the mortgage in suit and paid even at the time of the applica tion, that all the members of the petitioners ' family were not agriculturists within the meaning of the Act and were, therefore, not entitled to the benefits thereof, that the debt advanced under the mortgage deed of July 28, 1931, was not a ""loan"" as defined in the Act and, therefore, the Act did not apply.
It will be noticed that although the judg ment debtors applicants specifically prayed for the accounts being taken from 1922, when the loan was said to have been actually advanced, the decree holders, in their petition of objection, did not contest that position.
At the hearing of the application before the Additional Civil Judge, the learned pleader for the decree holders admitted that with the exception of Sita Ram the remaining judgment debtors were agriculturists under Act No. XIII of 1940 but that as Sita Ram was a party to the mortgage in suit they were not entitled to the benefit of the Act.
Two witnesses, namely Suraj Mani Tripathi and Sita Ram, were examined on behalf of the judgment debtors applicants.
Sita Ram stated that since 1907 he had been a teacher in Harish Chandra Intermediate College of Banaras, that in 1930 his salary was Rs. 90 per month, that since February 1932 to 1936 he paid incometax and that after that he paid no in come tax.
649 His evidence was corroborated by Suraj Mani Tripathi who was the Accountant of the College from 1930 to 1042.
Referring to the College Acquittance Roll Suraj Mani Tripathi deposed that the pay of Sita Ram was Rs. 90 per month throughout 1930, that in 1930 no income tax was levied, that in 1931 also his salary was Rs. 90 per month and that no income tax was deducted in 1931 too, that the first deduction of in come tax from his salary was made in February 1932.
No rebutting evidence was adduced by the decree holders on the hearing of the application under section 8 of the Act of 1940.
The income tax assessment form filed during the trial of the mortgage suit and marked as exhibits is dated Febru ary 9, 1933, and shows that on that date Sita Ram was as sessed at Rs. 1 14 0 as income tax on Rs. 180 for the year 1931 32.
By his judgment delivered on February 22, 1943, the Additional Civil Judge found that Sita Ram was not assessed to income tax either at the date of the application under section 8 or at the date of the mortgage of 1931 and, there fore, held that the applicants were agriculturists and that the case related to a loan as defined in Act XIII of 1940.
He then went on to discuss the question whether the account should be reopened from June 2, 1922, when the earlier mortgage was executed or from July 28, 1931, when the mort gage in suit was executed.
The decree holders who did not adduce any evidence on the hearing of the application evi dently relied on the evidence adduced in suit No. 33 of 1938.
After discussing that evidence the learned Judge came to the conclusion that so far as the judgment debtors were concerned the mortgagees in the two mortgages were one and the same.
He adversely commented on the non production of the books of account by the decree holders.
Re opening the accounts from June 2, 1922, the learned Judge concluded that the whole of the principal and interest payable accord ing to the Act had been fully discharged and that nothing remained due by the judgmentdebtors under the decree in suit No. 33 of 1938.
He 650 accordingly declared that the decree stood discharged in full and directed a note to that effect to be made in the Register of Suits.
The decree holders having appealed to the High Court, a Division Bench (B. Mallik, C.J. and 'Bind Basni Prasad J.) by its judgment delivered on April 16, 1948, held that the question whether Sita Ram was or was not an agriculturist on July 28, 1931, was not material as it was not denied that all the judgment, debtors were agriculturists on the date of suit.
Reference was made by the learned Judges to section 21 and it was stated that by reason of that section the mortgage amount could be recovered only from the mortgaged property and not personally from the mortgagors and accord ingly the proviso to the definition of ""loan"" in section 2 (9) of the Act had no application and it was, therefore, not necessary to show that the borrowers were agriculturists at the date when the advance was made and that as the judgment debtors were admittedly agriculturists at the date of the suit, the case was fully covered by the Full Bench decision of that High Court in Ketki Kunwar vs Ram Saroop (1).
The High Court, therefore, dismissed the appeal on this point alone.
The question whether the account should be reopened from 1922 or from 1931 was not raised by the decree holders at all. ]he decree holders have now come up on appeal before us on a certificate granted by the High Court under section 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Sri G.N. Kunzru appearing in support of this appeal has strongly questioned the correctness of the Full Bench deci sion relied on by the High Court and the interpretation put by the High Court on section 21 and section 2(9) of the Act.
As we think this appeal can be decided on a simpler ground we do not consider it necessary, on this occasion, to express any opinion on either of these questions which are by no means free from doubt.
(1) I.L.R. [1943] All. 35; A.I.R. 1942 All.
390; (1942) A. L.J. 578.
651 The present application has been made under section 8 of the U. P. Debt Redemption Act, 1940, subsection (1) of which, omitting the proviso, runs as ' follows: ""Notwithstanding the provisions of any decree, or of any law for the time being in force, an agriculturist or a workman liable to pay the amount due under a decree to which this Act applies passed before the commencement of this Act, may apply to the Civil Court which passed the decree or to which the execution of the decree has been transferred, for the amendment of the decree by reduction according to the provisions of this Act of the amount due under it, and on receipt of such application the Court shall, after notice to the opposite party, calculate the amount due from the appli cant in accordance with the provisions of sections 9 and 10 and shall amend the decree accordingly.
"" It is clear from the wording of the sub section that there are three pre requisites for exercise of the right conferred by it, namely, (1) that the application must be by an agriculturist and (2)that that agriculturist must be liable to pay the amount due under a decree to which this Act applies and (3) that that decree was passed before the commencement of this Act.
That the judgment debtors appli cants were agriculturists at the date when suit No. 33 of 1938 was filed and also in 1942 when the application under section 8 was made is conceded by Sri G.N. Kunzru.
The decree in that suit was passed on March 31, 1939, which was well before the commencement of the Act.
The only question that remains is whether the amount was due under a decree to which the Act applies.
Under section 2(6) of the Act the phrase ""decree to which this Act applies"" means a decree passed before or after the commencement of this Act in a suit to which this Act applies.
Section 2(17) defines the phrase ""suit to which this Act applies"" as meaning any suit or proceeding relating to a loan.
The question then, arises: was the decree under which the judgment debtors applicants are liable passed in a suit 652 relating to a loan ? Loan is thus defined in sec tion 2(9): 'Loan ' means an advance in cash or kind made before the first day of June, 1940, recoverable from an agriculturist or a workman or from any such person and other persons jointly or from the property of an agriculturist or workman and includes any transaction which in substance amounts to such advance, but does not include an advance the liability for the repayment of which has, by a contract with the borrower or his heir or successor or by sale in execution of a decree been transferred to another person or an advance by the Central or Provincial Government to make advances or by a co operative society or by a schedule bank: Provided that an advance recoverable from an agricul turist or from an agriculturist and other persons jointly shall not be deemed to be a loan for the purposes of this Act unless such advance was made to an agriculturist or to an agriculturist and other persons jointly."" In order to be a ""loan"" the advance must be recoverable from an agriculturist.
The word ""recoverable"" seems, prima facie, to indicate that the crucial point of time is when the advance becomes recover able, i.e., when the amount advanced becomes or falls due.
Under the mortgage of 1931 the date of redemption was 6 years from the date of execution, i.e., in July 1937.
Sri Kunzru concedes that Sita Ram was not as sessed to income tax.since 1936.
Assuming, but without deciding, that the proviso to section 2 (9) applies and that in order to be a ""loan"" it must be shown that the advance was made to one who, at the date of the advance, was an agriculturist as defined in section 2(3) of the Act the question has yet to be answered, namely, had Sita Ram ceased to be an agriculturist by reason of clause (b) of the provi so to section 2(3), that is to say, by reason of his being assessed to income tax on July 28, 1931.
According to the evidence of Surai Mani Tripathi and Sita Ram 653 income tax was first deducted at the source in the month of February 1932 by the College authorities and the actual assessment was made on February 9, 1933.
Therefore, Sita Ram was not assessed to incometax on July 28.
It is not disputed that the taxable minimum was reduced from Rs. 2,000 perannum to Rs. 1,000 per annum by the Indian Finance (Supplementary & Extending)Act, 1931, which was enacted on November 26, 1931.
Therefore, at the date of the advance, i.e., on July 28, 1931, Sita Ram Whose salary was below Rs. 2,000 per annum was not only not actually assessed to in come tax but was not even liable to such assessment.
The evidence of Suraj Mani Tripathi shows that the first deduc tion of incometax out of the salary was in the month of February 1932 and the income tax assessment form for 1931 32 (Ex.S) shows that tax was assessed on Rs. 180 which was evidently salary for February and March 1932 being the last two months of the assessment year.
The position therefore is that Sita Ram was not assessed to income tax at the date of the advance in 1931 or on the due date under the deed, i.e., in July 1937, or on the date of suit in 1938 or on the date of the application under section 8 in 1942.
It consequently follows that he was an agriculturist on all these dates.
The other judgment debtors were admittedly agriculturists.
Therefore, the application under section 8 was made by persons who were all agriculturists and who were liable to pay under a decree to which the Act applies, i.e., under a decree passed in a suit relating to a loan as defined by section 2(9).
The Courts below therefore, were right in their conclusion that the judgment debtors applicants were entitled to the benefit of the Act.
Sri G.N. Kunzru finally submitted that in any case the accounts could not be taken from 1922, for the mortgagees under the two mortgages were different.
We have already pointed out that this point was not specifically taken in the decree holders ' petition of objection.
The trial Court held as a fact that so far as the judgment debtors were concerned the 654 mortgagees were the same in both the mortgages.
Although in the petition of appeal to the High Court it was alleged that the mortgagees were different and the accounts could not be reopened from 1922, that ground was not specifi cally urged before the High Court.
The determination of that question must necessarily involve an investigation into facts.
We do not think, in the absence of a plea in this behalfin the decree holders ' petition of objection and also in view of their failure and neglect to raise this question before the High Court, it will be right for this final court of appeal, at this stage and in the circumstances of this case, to permit the appellants to raise this question of fact.
The result, therefore, is that this appeal must stand dis missed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
","A mortgage was executed by several persons on the 28th July, 1931.
The term of the mortgage, namely six years, expired in July 1937, the mortgagees instituted a suit in May 1938 and a decree was passed in March 1939.
An applica tion for relief under the U.P. Debt Redemption Act (XIII of 1940) was made on 11th April, 1942, and this application was resisted on the ground that S, one of the mortgagors, had been assessed to income tax and was therefore not an agri culturist, and the suit was not consequently ""a suit to which the Act applied.
"" The evidence showed that S was earning a monthly salary of Rs. 90 and that from February 1932 he had been assessed to income tax till the year 1936.
The High Court held, relying on the Full Bench ruling in Ketki Kunwar vs Ram Saroop (I.L.R. 1943 All. 35), that under sec.
21 of the Act the mortgage money could be recovered only from the mortgaged property and not personally and that the proviso to sec.
2 (9) of the Act had therefore no application and the question whether S was an agriculturist on the date of the mortgage was immaterial.
As S was admit tedly an agriculturist on the date of the suit, the High Court held that the judgment debtors were entitled to relief under the Act.
On appeal Held, that, assuming that the proviso to sec.
2 (9) applied and that in order to be a ""loan"" within the meaning of the Act it must be shown that the advance was made to one who at the date of the advance was an agriculturist, S was not an agriculturist on the 28th.
July, 1931, as the Indian Finance (Supplementary and Extending)Act of 1931 which reduced the taxable minimum from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 1,000 was passed only in November 1931 and income tax was first deducted from his salary only in February, 1932.
Quaere: Whether the Full Bench decision in Ketki Kuwar vs Ram Saroop (I.L.R. 1943 All. 35) is correct.

The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by MAHAJAN J.
796 Mst.
Khem Kuer, the young widow of Shah Chiranji Lal, was murdered on the 28th August, 1919, and Mst.
Mohan Kuer, the mother, died on the 5th December, 1932.
Prem Kuer, the respondent in the appeal, claiming herself to be the heir to Shah Chiranji Lal as his sister, brought the suit giving rise to this appeal in the court of the civil judge, Agra, against, amongst others, Mst.
Phool Kuer, the present appellant, for recovery of possession of the properties of Shah Chiranji Lal and mesne profits.
Prem Kuer joined her half sister Mst.
Ram Kuer and their sons as plaintiffs along with herself.
In the array of defendants were impleaded Mst.
Phool Kuer and Mst.
Khem Kuer, widows of Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal and his sons and a host of others as transferees of the properties.
The main defence to the suit was that Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal were recognized to be the owners and heirs to the entire estate of Shah Chiranji Lal by Khem Kuer and Mohan Kuer in a family settlement arrived at between the parties in suit No. 120 of 1915, that by virtue of this family settlement the estate of the deceased was vested in them subject to the life estates of the two women and that the plaintiffs who came to be recognized as reversioners by the Hindu Law of Inheritance (Amendment) Act, 11 of 1929, were not entitled to claim it.
It was further pleaded that on the death of Khem Kuer in 1919, Mohan Kuer surrendered the estate in favour of Jwala Prasad and Madho Lal and they took possession of it as owners and the plaintiffs who subsequently became statutory heirs in 1919 could not be allowed to question the surrender and reopen the succession which could not remain in abeyance.
The learned additional civil judge who tried the suit, dismissed it holding that the compromise of 1915 was a bona fide settlement of a bona fide dispute and was binding as a family settlement being for the benefit of the estate, that Mohan Kuer surrendered the estate validly in favour of Jwala Prasad and Madho 795 MAHAJAN J.
The dispute in this appeal concerns the zemindari and house properties last owned by Shah Chiranji Lal who died at a young age on the 14th May, 1913, leaving him surviving a widow, Mst.

Some of the transferees who had been implead ed as defendants compromised the suit with the plaintiffs and that part of the suit was decided according to the terms thereof between those parties.
Prem Kuer preferred an appeal to the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad against the decree dismissing her suit.
The High Court by its judgment dated the 26th Octo ber, 1943, allowed the appeal, reversed the findings of the learned additional civil judge on the above issues and decreed the plaintiffs ' suit with costs.
Some of the trans feree defendants compromised with the plaintiff appellant in the High Court and the appeal was decided in terms thereof in their favour.
Two main points which are in controversy in this appeal and require consideration, are: 1.
Whether the compromise in suit No. 120 of 1915 amounts to a family settlement and binds the plaintiff respondent, and, 2.
Whether the surrender by Mst.
Mohan Kuer was a valid surrender under Hindu law.
In order to appreciate the respective contentions of the parties, it is necessary to set out shortly in chronological order the history of the events which has resulted in this controversy.
As already stated, Shah Chiranji Lal died on the 14th May, 1913, leaving considerable movable and immovable property.
At the time of his death, his widow Khem Kuer was about eleven years old and his mother Mohan Kuer was about 53 years old.
The two reversioners, Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal, made an application for mutation of names of the estate in their favour claiming it on the basis of a will alleged to have been made by Shah Chiranji Lal on the 13th May, 1913, a day before his death.
On the 10th of September, 1913, an application was made by Mohan Kuer for herself and as guardian of Khem Kuer Challenging the genu ineness of the will and claiming 798 that the estate of the late Shah Chiranji Lal should be mutated in their names.
Notice of this application was given to the two reversioners but they thought it prudent not to appear and to contest the contentions raised by the two ladies.
with the result that the inheritance of the late Chiranji Lal was mutated in the name of the widow as sole heir under the guardianship of Mohan Kuer by an order dated the 28th October, 1913.
The reversioners had also made applications in pending suits for getting themselves im pleaded as legal representatives.
Mohan Kuer applied for the removal of their names and for substitution of the name of the widow and of herself in those cases.
Pending decision of these matters, on the 11th May, 1915, suit No. 120 of 1915 was filed by Jwala Prasad and Madho Lal on the basis of the alleged will of the 13th May, 1913.
On the same day an application was made for the appointment of a receiver and an interim order appointing a receiver was passed by the court.
On the 18th May, 1915, Mohan Kuer for herself and as guardian of the minor widow made an application praying for the discharge of the receiver.
By an order dated the 23rd September, 1915, the receiver was discharged and it was held by the civil judge that the plaintiffs had no prima facie case and that the will propounded by them was a suspicious document.
On the 18th December, 1915, suit No. 120 of 1915 was compromised between the parties.
This compromise is in the following terms : ""1.
The plaintiffs relinquish their claim for possession over the estate of Shah Chiranji Lal.
The defendants shall have all those rights to the estate of Shah Chiranji Lal, which she had as a Hindu widow according to law.
After the death of the two Musammats, the plaintiffs in equal shares and, after them, their heirs, who might have the right of survivorship one after the other, shall be the owners of the estate of Shah Chiranji Lal.
The name of Mst.
Mohan Kunwar defendant against one half of the property in lieu of maintenance, shall continue.
799 4.
Mohan Kunwar and Mst.
Khem Kunwar shall have power to do anything they might choose with the entire income from the movable and immovable property, cash, orna ments, amount of decrees and documents, household goods and other movables, which they might have in their possession.
The plaintiffs or anyone else shall have no power to inter fere or to ask for rendition of accounts.
In case Mohan Kunwar defendant dies first, Mst.
Khem Kunwar shall, as a Hindu widow, become the owner in posses sion of the entire property, of which Mst, Mohan Kuer might have been in possession in any way, subject to the provi sions of condition No. 4.
In ,case Mst.
Khem Kuer defendant dies first, Mst, Mohan Kuer shall as a Hindu widow, become the owner in possession of the entire property of which.
Mst, Khem Kuer might have been in possession in any way, subject to the provisions of condition No. 4."" In accordance with the terms of this compromise suit No. 120 of 1915 was dismissed.
In the proceedings that were pending for substitution of names the court on the 22nd December, 1915, ordered that Khem Kuer and Mohan Kuer be impleaded as legal representatives of the late Shah Chiranji Lal.
On the 2nd September, 1918, Khem Kuer brought a suit against her mother in law Mohan Kuer for a declaration to the effect that she alone was the lawful heir of Chiranji Lal and was the owner of the property, mentioned in schedule A and that the defendant had no concern with it.
This suit was compromised between the parties on the 22nd April, 1919.
Mohan Kuer agreed that Khem Kuer 's suit be decreed.
Khem Kuer undertook to look after Mohan Kuer in every way and if she desired to live separately from her, she agreed to pay her a sum of Rs. 3000 per annum by way of maintenance.
Khem Kuer did not live long after her having become owner of the entire estate of her husband under the terms of this compromise.
As stated already, she was murdered on the 28th August, 1919.
The estate 104 800 thus became vested in Mohan Kuer both according to Hindu law as well as in accordance with the terms of the compromise of the 18th December, 1915.
It is alleged that either on the fourth or the thirteenth day after the death of Khem Kuer, Mohan Kuer when asked about the mutation of the estate, said that she had no concern with it and had relinquished it and had devoted herself to worship.
On the 15th September, 1919, an application bearing the signature of Mohan Kuer in Hindi was presented by her mukhtar Chaturbhuj in the court of the subordinate judge at Agra, praying that the sale certificate in suit No. 1919 (Shah Jwala Prasad vs Rai Bahadur Shah Durga Prasad), be prepared in the names of Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal, for they were the heirs in possession of the properties of Shah Chiranji Lal.
This application (Exhibit N 31) contains the following recital: ""Mst.
Khem Kuer died on the 28th of August, 1919.
I do not want to take any proceedings in my own name.
Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal are the subsequent heirs and it is in their names that all the mutation proceedings etc. are being taken in the revenue court.
They have been made the heirs in possession of the entire property and an applica tion has been filed in their names in this court for prepara tion of the sale certificate.
This petitioner has got no objection to the preparation of the sale certificate in their names, for they are the heirs and are in possession of the property.
"" The sale certificate was prepared accordingly.
On the 16th September, 1919, Jwala Prasad and Madho Lal applied for mutation in respect of the lands relating to mauza Somra in the court of the tahsildar of Etmadpur.
In column 5 of this application (Exhibit A 14) it was alleged that they were entitled to mutation by right of inheritance.
Similar appli cations were made in respect of other villages also.
(Vide Exhibit 128 etc.) Mutations were entered in all the villages on the basis that both of them were heirs in equal shares to the property of the deceased, though according to Hindu law, Shah Jwala Prasad alone was the 801 next heir.
During the course of the mutation proceedings one Chintaman, general attorney of Shah Jwala Prasad was exam ined on the 11th October, 1919 and he stated that Mst.
Khem Kuer died on the 28th August, 1919, that Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal were her heirs in equal shares, that Mohan Kuer was the mother in law of the deceased and she did not want her name to be recorded and had made relinquishment in favour of Shah Madho Lal and Shah Jwala Prasad in the civil court on the 15th September, 1919.
Chaturbhuj, gener al attorney of Mohan Kuer was examined in the same proceed ings on the 27th October, 1919, and he stated that Mohan Kuer did not want her name to be recorded in place of the name of the deceased, that she had no objection to the entry of the names of Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal, that she had sent him for making that statement.
He admitted the relinquishment filed by Mohan Kuer in the civil court with respect to the property of Mst.
Khem Kuer but he was not able to state when that relinquishment had taken place.
The tahsildar after recording these statements ordered the mutation of names in favour of the two reversioners (Exhibit M 2).
On the 22nd November, 1919, the two reversioners Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal, having entered into possession of the estate after the death of Khem Kuer made a gift of property of the value of about Rs. 50,000 in favour of the sisters of Shah Chiranji Lal by means of two deeds of gift.
(Vide Exhibit M 16).
These gift deeds contain the following recitals : ""Shah Chiranji Lal deceased was the owner of Katariha estate in which besides other villages the villages speci fied below were also included, and as he had no issue after his death Mst.
Khem Kuer became his heir as a Hindu widow of a joint family subject to Mitakshara school of law.
On her death we the executants who were entitled to become the absolute owners of the estate of Shah Chiranji Lal according to Shastras became the absolute owner of the entire property 802 of Shah Chiranji Lal by inheriting the estate from him.
We obtained possession over everything and mutation of names also were effected in our favour from the revenue court in respect of all villages.
Shah Chiranji Lal deceased had two sisters Mst.
Ram Kuer and Mst.
Prem Kuer and he had a desire during his lifetime to give them some property but owing to sudden death he could not himself fulfil his intention during his lifetime.
We the executants accept this fact as desired by him.
Besides this the mother of Shah Chiranji Lal also desires the same thing and it is our duty to fulfil the same, and to give property to the Musammats aforesaid is considered to be a pious and good act from the religious point of view.
It is our duty also to respect their wishes and fulfil the same, so that the people of our caste and family might not think that after the death of Shah Chiranji Lal his wishes remained unfulfilled.
Hence for the reasons set forth above and keeping in view the honour of the family and pious nature of the act we the executants while in a sound state of body and mind . . . make a gift of the following villages in favour of the donees.
"" The donees subsequently made a number of transfers of the property gifted to them and in every respect the gift deeds were acted upon.
Jwala Prasad, the presumptive rever sioner, died in the year 1980.
In suit No. 49 of 1928 (same as No. 89 of 1929) one Pandit Rikh Ram had obtained a decree against Shah Madho Lal and his sons and they appealed against it to the High Court and also applied for postponement of the preparation of the final decree.
Stay was ordered on the applicants furnishing security in the sum of Rs. 20,000 for future interest, costs, etc.
On the 26th May, 1930, in compliance with the order of the High Court a security bond was executed by Shah Madho Lal and his sons as first party and by Mst.
Mohan Kuer as second party, containing the following recitals : ""After the death of Mst.
Khem Kuer Mst.
Mohan Kuer was to become the owner of the property with 803 limited interests as a Hindu mother, but she relinquished her inheritance and did not agree to accept any property.
By means of a private arrangement, i.e., a family arrange ment, it was decided as between Shah Jwala Prasad and Shah Madho Lal that they should be the owners of the property aforesaid in equal shares.
Documents in that connection were registered.
Thus Shah Madho Lal executant No.1 is the exclusive owner of the property given below which is being pledged and hypothecated under this security bond.
Execu tant No. 4, the second party, has, after hearing and under standing the contents of this security bond, joined in token of the veracity of the facts noted above so that in future she might not be able to take objection to it and so that she might have no objection of any sort to the security bond."" (Executant No. 4 was Mst.
Mohan Kuer).
On the 30th June, 1930, an affidavit bearing the thumb impression of Mst.
Mohan Kuer was filed in the same pro ceedings containing the following statements : ""I solemnly affirm and say that after the death of Mst.
Khem Kuer I did not agree to accept property nor was I the heir and that I relinquished the entire property in favour of Shah Jwala Prasad who became the owner of the entire property which was in possession of Khem Kuer.
"" The Subordinate Judge expressed the view that the bond could not be held to have been executed by Mohan Kuer, she being a pardanashin lady.
He declined to accept the deed as sufficient and valid security.
On the 9th July, 1930, the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dismissed the applica tion for stay of proceedings.
On the 15th July, 1931, Mohan Kuer instituted suit No. 24 of 1931 in the court of the subordinate judge of Mathura against the widows of Shah Jwala Prasad, Shah Madho Lal and his sons and a number of transferees who had taken the property from these two reversioners.
In para 8 of the plaint it was alleged 804 that the plaintiff was an old pardanashin woman, was simple and of week intellect and illiterate, that on account of the murder of Mst.
Khem Kuer, she was very terror stricken and was full of sorrow and had no knowledge about her rights, that the third defendant and Jwala Prasad who wanted to get the property took undue advantage of the plaintiff 's afore said condition and unlawfully entered into possession of the property left by Chiranji Lal deceased and caused the muta tion of names in their favour.
In para.
12 it was said that the defendants had got the thumb impressions of the plain tiff on certain documents without telling her the contents of those papers, simply by saying that a decree for a con siderable amount had been passed against the property and it was going to be sold in auction and that a security bond must be furnished for saving the property.
She prayed for a decree for possession of the property in dispute in her favour against the defendants.
During the pendency of this suit Mohan Kuer died on the 5th December, and on her death an attempt was made by the present plaintiffs to get them selves impleaded as her legal representatives but on the 9th October 1934 it was held that the claim of Mst.
Mohan Kuer was of a personal character and the suit therefore could not proceed owing to abatement.
It was, however, noted that the legal representatives could file a separate suit, if so advised.
It is in consequence of this order that the suit out of which this appeal arises was filed on the 30th April 1936.
It was contended by the learned Attorney General that the High Court on mere suspicions and unwarranted assump tions had found the main issues in the case against the appellant and had erroneously held that the compromise in suit No. 120 of 1915 was not binding on the 'plaintiffs and that the surrender by Mohan Kuer was not valid surrender under Hindu law.
After hearing the learned counsel at considerable length, we did not think it necessary to hear the respondent in reply, as in our opinion, the decision of the High Court on both the points was right.
805 On the point of surrender, the learned Attorney General contended that the widow effaced herself and put both the reversioners in possession of the property half and half, and agreed to take Rs. 3,000 from them for her maintenance and that the fact of surrender was satisfactorily proved from the conduct of Mohan Kuer in allowing the estate to be mutated in the names of the reversioners and in allowing them to take possession of it, also by the different state ments made by her and from the other documentary and oral evidence led in the case.
Emphasis was laid on the state ments contained in the application (Exhibit M 31), on the statement of her mukhtar Chaturbhuj, and on the recitals of the security bond and the affidavit, Exhibit P 30.
Whether Mohan Kuer effaced herself and surrendered the property, or whether she merely abandoned it, or whether she entered into an arrangement for the division of the estate between herself, the two reversioners and the daughters and their sons it is not possible to predicate with any amount of certainty.
No definite opinion can be offered on the question whether whatever she did, she did voluntarily after fully realizing the consequences of her act and wheth er as a pardanashin lady she had.been properly advised on the matter or whether she merely acted on sentiment.
Considerable doubt is cast on the story of surrender set up by the defendants by the recitals in the two deeds of gift, dated 22nd November, 1919, extracted above.
The donors did not base their title to the property either on the compromise of 1915 or on the surrender of Mohan Kuer of the year 1919 or on the will; on the other hand, they said that they had become owners of the property of Chiranji Lal by inheritance under Hindu law after the death of his widow.
Both of them could not possibly inherit the property half and half under Hindu law.
Moreover, there is no clear or definite evidence of either the time when the arrangement was made or of the terms thereof.
The evidence on these points is vague and 806 unsatisfactory.
It is completely wanting as to the arrange ment under which Mohan Kuer became entitled to receive Rs. 3,000 from them.
The conduct of Mohan Kuer and the various statements by her no doubt do indicate that she cut off her connection with the bulk of the estate of Chiranji Lal after the death of the widow and received a sum of Rs. 3,000 from the rever sioners and it is also clear that at her instance the rever sioners gave property of the value of Rs. 50,000 to her daughters, but in the absence of any satisfactory evidence as to the precise nature of this arrangement it is not possible to conclude that the widow after fully realizing as to what she was doing and after proper advice effaced her self.
In this connection the allegations made by her in the suit of 1931 cannot be altogether ruled out from considera tion.
Assuming however for the sake of argument that Mobart Kuer purported to relinquish her estate in favour of Jwala Prasad and Madho Lal, in our opinion, the relinquishment connot in law operate as an extinction of her title in the estate.
The principle underlying the doctrine of surrender is that it cannot possibly be made in favour of anybody except the next heir of the husband.
Vesting of the estate in the next reversioner takes place under operation of law and it is not possible for the widow to say that she is withdrawing herself from the husband 's estate in order that it may vest in somebody other than the next heir of the husband.
It was held by this court in Mummareddi Nagi Reddi vs Pitti Durairaja Naidu(1) that so far as the next heir is concerned, there cannot be a surrender of the total ity of the interest which the widow had, if she actually directs that a portion of it should be held or enjoyed by somebody else other than the husband 's heirs and that the position is not materially altered if the surrender is made in favour of the next heir with whom a stranger is associat ed and the widow purports to.
relinquish the estate in order that it may vest in (1) [1951] s.c.
R. 655.
807 both of them.
Though in the written statements of the two sets of defendants different versions of the character of the arrangement were pleaded, the learned Attorney General before us stated that the surrender by the widow was made both in favour of Jwala Prasad and Madho Lal in equal moie ties.
Madho Lal admittedly was not the next reversioner entitled to succeed to the estate.
Thus the surrender of the totality of the interest of the widow was not made in favour of the next heir.
That being so, it cannot operate as a valid surrender.
If the surrender could be held a valid one, then obviously succession that had opened out in 1919 and vested in the next heirs could not be divested at the instance of the plaintiffs in the year 1932 on the death of Mohan Kuer, but in view of the invalidity of the surren der it has to be held that succession to Shah Chiranji Lal 's estate opened in 1932 and the plaintiffs as next heirs were entitled to take it.
The next question for consideration is whether the compromise of 1915 entered into between Mohan Kuer as guardian of Khem Kuer, and the two reversioners who had claimed the estate on the basis of a will, was a bona fide family arrangement and thus binding on the ultimate rever sioners, the plaintiffs.
It is well settled that when the estate of a deceased Hindu vests in a female heir, a decree fairly and properly obtained against her in regard to the estate is in the absence of fraud or collusion binding on the reversionary heir, but the decree against the female holder must have involved the decision of a question of title and not merely a question of the widow 's possession during her life (vide Venayeck Anundrow vs Luxumeebaee (1).
This principle of res judicata is not limited to decrees in suits contested and it is competent to a widow to enter into a compromise in the course of a suit bona fide in the inter est of the estate, and not for ' her personal advantage, and a decree passed on such compromise is binding upon the reversioner.
The question whether the transaction (1) 808 is a bona fide settlement of a disputed right between the parties depends on the substance of the transaction and in order that it may bind the estate it should be a prudent and reasonable act in the circumstances of the case.
As observed by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Ram sumran Prasad vs Shyam Kumari (1), the true doctrine is laid down in Mohendra Nath Biswas vs Shamsunnessa Khatun(2), decided in 1914, and it is that a compromise made bona fide for the benefit of the estate and not for the personal advantage of a limited owner will bind the reversioner quite as much as a decree against her after contest.
That being so,we proceed to inquire whether the compromise in the present case is one that can be supported on these principles.
In agreement with the High Court we are of the opinion that it cannot be so supported.
Mohan Kuer in entering into the compromise on behalf of the minor widow never applied her mind to the interests of the ultimate reversioners.
She entered into it for her own personal benefit and for the personal benefit of the minor widow in complete indifference as to what was to happen to the estate after their respective deaths.
Under this compromise these two ladies got all the rights they had under Hindu law without sacrificing an iota of their property and then they agreed that after their death the plaintiffs in equal shares and after them their heirs shall be the owners of the estate of Chiranji Lal.
It did not matter in the least to the two ladies what was to happen to the estate after their deaths and they were quite willing to let this estate go to the plaintiffs in the suit, though one of them was a remote reversioner.
The compromise therefore was made in the interest of the actual parties to the suit in complete disregard of the interests of the ultimate reversioners.
The widows undoubtedly acted with reasonableness and pru dence so far as their personal interest was concerned but further than that they did not see.
The claim, of the two plaintiffs in Suit No. 120 of 1916 was adverse to the inter est of the (1) (1922) 49 I,A. 342.
(2) 809 reversion as they were claiming as legatees under the will.
The widows while entering into the compromise safeguarded their personal rights only and thus in entering into it they only represented themselves and not the estate or the rever sioners and surrendered nothing out of their rights, and it cannot be said that in the true sense of the term it was a bona fide settlement of disputed rights where each party gave up something of its own rights to the other.
The plain tiffs got an admission from the widows in regard to the future succession of the estate that after their deaths they would succeed though they were not heirs in accordance with Hindu law.
By this admission the widows lost nothing what soever.
Those who lost were the ultimate reversioners and their interest was not in the least either considered or safeguarded.
In these circumstances it seems to us that the compromise cannot be held to be a bona fide settlement or family arrangement of disputed rights and was entered into by Mohan Kuer for her personal advantage and of the advan tage of Khem Kuer.
The present case is analogous to the decision of the Privy Council in Imrit Konwur vs Roop Narain Singh (1).
There in a dispute between a person claiming to be an adopted son of the previous owner and the widow and her daughters who would have title after her, the widow gave up her daughters ' rights in consideration of her receiving practically unimpaired what she could.
Their Lordships held that such a compromise could not stand, as indeed it was not a compromise at all.
The learned Attorney General laid considerable emphasis on the decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Mata Prasad vs Nageshar Sahai (2).
In that case the widow admitted the right of the reversioner under Act I of 1869 and agreed that succession will be governed by that Act.
The reversioner agreed to let her remain in possession and undertook that he would not alienate the property during that period.
The widow in that case was not constituted a full owner under Hindu law and she did not get her full rights (1) (2) (1925) 52 I.A.393 810 under the compromise but as a matter of concession was allowed to remain in possession by the reversioner and as a matter of fact she sacrificed her rights to a considerable extent and did not act for her personal benefit at all except to the limited extent mentioned above.
In the cir cumstances of that case it was held ""that the compromise was a bona fide family settlement of disputed claims and was binding on the reversioners.
In the present case the devolu tion of the property after the death of Chiranji Lal was agreed to be in accordance with Hindu law and that being so, the further devolution of the property after their death was no concern of the widows.
That was a matter of law.
The ultimate reversioners were stabbed in the back by the widow and such a compromise cannot be held to be binding on them.
A large number of cases were cited before us in which com promises under different circumstances had been held to be binding on the reversioners.
We consider that it is wholly unnecessary to examine those cases because the circum stances in which those compromises were made were quite different from the circumstances of the present case.
Considering all the materials which were placed before us, we hold in agreement with the High Court that the compromise in the present case was neither prudent nor reasonable so far as it affected the interests of the estate and that of the ultimate reversioners and that being so, is not binding on the plaintiffs.
For the reasons given above this appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
Civil Appeal No. 30 of 1951.
This is an appeal by one of the transferees and arises out of the same suit out of which arises appeal No. 29 of 1951.
On the 13th June, 1928, Shah Madho Lal and his son Shah Madhusudan Lal executed a sale deed (Exhibit M 13) in favour of the appellant for the sum of Rs. 21,000.
The transferee while adopting the defence taken by Madho Lal and by the heirs of Jwala Prasad, pleaded that he was protected by the provisions of section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act.
811 The High Court held that in cases where a person who has allowed another to occupy the position of an ostensible owner has a limited estate, the rule of section 41 applies only during the lifetime of the limited owner and is not available to protect transferees against the claim of the reversioners.
A number of authorities were cited in support of this proposition.
The learned counsel for the appellant was unable to displace this proposition.
It is quit","A relinquishment by a Hindu widow of her estate in favour of the next reversioner and a stranger in equal moieties is not a valid surrender under Hindu law.
A valid surrender cannot be made in favour of anybody except the next heir of the husband.
Mummareddi Nagireddi vs Pitti Durairaja Naidu [1951] (S.C.R. 655) followed.
It is competent to a Hindu widow to enter into a compro mise in the course of the suit bona fide in the interest of the estate and not for her personal advantage and a decree passed on such a compromise will be binding on the rever sioner.
The question whether a compromise is a bona fide settlement of a disputed right between the parties depends on the substance of the transaction and in order that it may bind the estate it should be a prudent and reasonable act.
[On the facts their Lordships held, agreeing with the High Court, that, the compromise in the present case was neither prudent nor reasonable so far as it affected the interests of the estate and of the ultimate reversioners and that it was not, therefore, binding on the reversioners.] Ramsumaran Prasad vs Shyam Kumari (49 I.A. 342), Mohendra Nath Biswas vs Shamsunnessa Khatun (21 C.L.J. 157) and Imrit Kunwar vs Roop Narain Singh fol lowed.
Mata Prasad vs Nageshar Sahai (52 I.A. 393) distin guished.

86.txt,"Criminal Appeal No. 12 of 1952.
Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated 4th June, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature of Punjab at Simla (Bhandari and Soni JJ.) in Criminal Appeal No. 109 of 1951 arising out of Judgment and order dated 19th March 1951 of the Court of the Additional Sessions Judge, Ferozepore, in Sessions Trial No. 18 of 1951.
T.R. Bhasin, for the appellant.
Gopal Singh, for the respondent.
April 30.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.
This is a simple case though it was argued at great length on behalf of the appellant and a number of technical objections to the validity of the trial taken.
The appellant Bhagwan Singh has been convicted of the murder of one Buggar Singh and sentenced to death.
He has also been convicted under section 19(f) of the Indian Arms Act but we are not concerned with that here.
The prosecution story is that the appellant bore a grudge against the deceased because the deceased had fired at the appellant 's brother some six or seven years before the present occurrence and was sent to jail for 814 it.
When he came out of jail the police thought it prudent to take proceedings against both sides under section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
This resulted in the appel lant 's two brothers and his cousins being bound down, as also the deceased.
This, it is said, constituted the motive for the present crime.
On the date of the occurrence, the 7th of September 1950, the prosecution state that the appellant was sitting at the shop of Jit Singh, P.W. 2, when the deceased came there about 12 15 p.m. and borrowed Rs. 5 from Jit Singh who lent him the money and entered the transaction in his ac count book.
When the deceased left the shop he was followed by the appellant who shot him at point blank range with a pistol only 4 or 5 karams from the shop.
This attracted the attention of a number of bystanders who immediately chased the appellant and apprehended him after a short run of about 30 karams.
He was still carrying the pistol.
It was taken away from him by Jagir Singh Patwari, P.W. 4.
The appellant was immediately taken to the local police post about 100 karams distant and the shopkeeper Jit Singh, P.W. 2, made the first information report at 12 a7 p.m. within 15 minutes of the occurrence.
The motive is proved by Bhag Singh, P.W. 7, who has been believed and that part of the case was ' not challenged before us.
The occurrence was witnessed by a large number of persons of whom the prosecution examined only five.
Two of them turned hostile in the Sessions Court and one gave evidence which has been regarded by the High Court as neu tral.
The remaining two, Balbir Singh (P.W. 5) and Jaswant Singh (P.W. 6) have been believed.
The only questions are (1) whether the conviction can be rested on their testimony and(2) whether certain irregularities in the trial vitiate it.
No attack was made on the testimony of Balbir Singh, P.W. 5, except that the two eye witnesses who 815 resiled in the Sessions Court contradict him.
But it was argued that the evidence of Jaswant Singh P.W. 6, is viti ated because he was not examined by the Committing Magis trate.
It was said that makes his evidence in the Sessions Court inadmissible.
This raises a question which is largely academic in this case because the reason Jaswant Singh, P.W. 6, was not examined by the Committing Magistrate is that the witness had gone away and was not available and it would have been a needless, and indeed unjustifiable, holding up of the pro ceedings to wait till he could be found and summoned.
It is evident that the Sessions Court has power to examine wit nesses who were not examined before the Committing Magis trate because of section 540 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and if the witness is treated as a prosecution witness and examined by the prosecuting counsel instead of by the Court itself that at best would be an irregularity curable by section 537.
The proper time to object to such a procedure would be at the trial itself, and as the appellant was represented in the Sessions Court by two counsel it is too late to object to such a venial irregularity in this Court.
The learned counsel for the appellant took us elaborate ly through the provisions of Chapter XVIII of the Criminal Procedure Code and stressed in particular section 208 (1) but we need not enter into this because section 540 is a complete answer in this particular case.
None of the cases cited goes so far as to say that no witness who was not produced in the committal proceedings can be examined at the trial and we would be unable to agree if they did.
The decision most in favour of the appellant 's contention is Sher Bahadur vs The Crown (1)but that does no more than consider such an omission as a curable defect.
Abdul Qadir J. said at pages 338 and 342 that it was conceded before them that section 540 could be called in aid in such a case, and at page 339 the learned Judge dealt with the question of prejudice (1)(1934)I.L.R. 15 lah.331.
106 816 and concluded at page 344 with the remark that the question is one of fact in each case and that in his opinion there was prejudice in that particular case.
The other learned Judge took the same view at pages 3J,7 and 348 and said: ""The Court can, of course, always use its discretion and allow the production of further evidence.
"" It is to be observed that the objection in that case was raised at a very early stage and before the sessions trial had commenced; also that the prosecution wished to examine no less than eight material witnesses (out of a total of sixteen) which they had deliberately withheld in the commit tal proceedings.
We make no remarks about the correctness of the observations which travel beyond the question of prejudice because that is unnecessary here.
It is sufficient to say that the learned Judges conceded the power under section 510 and decided the case on the question of preju dice.
The question raised in Queen Empress vs G.W. Hayfield(1) does not arise here because the Sessions Court did not refuse to examine Jaswant Singh, P.W. 6, and so the question whether the prosecution could demand his examina tion as a matter of right never arose.
The fact remains that they were permitted to do so and the defence raised no objection.
The decision of the Allahabad High Court in S.H. Jhabwa la vs Emperor (2)and the Full Bench of the Lahore High Court in Mussammat Niamat vs The Crown(3) are against the learned counsel 's contention.
The decision of the Full Bench of the Lower Burma Chief Court in Emperor vs Channing Arnold (4) is not in point because the Committing Magistrate there refused to examine witnesses which the prosecution wanted, and indeed insisted that he should examine, and what was worse he prevented the accused from completing the cross examination of the only prosecution witness which the Committing Magistrate thought fit to examine.
Whatever else may be thought of (1) All. 212.
(3) (Z936) I.L.R. 17 Lah.
(2) A.I.R. 1933 All. 690.
(4) (1912) 13 Cr. L,.
J. 877.
817 section 208 it is evident that the accused has the right to cross examine.
at any rate, those of the witnesses who are.examined by the Committing Magistrate on behalf of the prosecution and section :547 cannot be used as a cloak for a hasty committal before such cross examination is complete.
In our opinion, the cases cited do not justify the extreme position taken up by the learned counsel for the appellant and as section 540 is a complete answer in this case all we need consider is the question of prejudice.
We do not hold that the Court is bound to examine a witness called under section 540 itself as a court witness and that it can never entrust the examination to the prosecuting counsel because even if that be the proper procedure no prejudice has been occasioned in this particular case.
The irregularity here on this score, if indeed it is one, is so trivial as to be innocuous.
A more important question is, was the appellant taken by surprise and was prejudice occasioned because of that ? We do not think so because Jaswant Singh was mentioned in the first information report, recorded within 15 minutes of the occurrence, as one of the eye witnesses and he was again mentioned as an eye witness in the calendar of the committal proceedings.
The appellant was presumably supplied with the witnesses ' statement to the police, or at any rate he had the right to demand a copy under section 162 and if he did not do so, It was presumably because neither he nor his two learned counsel wanted it.
The first information report is a full one and sets out all the essentials of the prosecution case; therefore, with all that information in the possession of the appellant and his counsel it could be impossible for him to contend that he did not know what this witness was to prove.
Had the witness travelled beyond the statements embodied in the first information report, objection to the use of any thing not contained in it would have been understandable, though to be effective such 818 objection would ordinarily have to be raised at the trial, but as the witness does not do that, there can be no objec tion on the score of prejudice.
It is to be observed that the Explanation to section 537 requires a Court to take into consideration the fact whether any objection on the score of irregularity could have been raised at an earlier stage.
Now the High Court bases its decision on the evidence of these eye witnesses and on the fact that the appellant was apprehended on the spot within a minute or two of the murder with the pistol still in his possession, and had the learned Judges stopped there, there would have been no foundation for the very elaborate network of technicalities upon which the learned counsel for the appellant embarked.
But Bhand ari J. (Soni J. concurring) after saying that ""After a careful consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the case I entertain no doubt in my mind that Balbir Singh and Jaswant Singh P. Ws. have told nothing but the truth"" went on to say""and that Jit Singh and Jagir Singh who made correct statements before the police and before the Committing Magistrate have given false evidence in the trial Court with the object of saving the appellant from the gallows.
"" It was argued that the learned Judges have here used the evidence of these witnesses before the Committing Magis trate as substantive evidence despite the fact that it was legally inadmissible for that purpose because the formali ties prescribed by section 288 were not observed.
Reliance was placed upon Tara Singh vs The State(1).
Even if that be so, it would make no difference because the evidence of Balbir Singh and Jaswant Singh, whom the learned Judges primarily believe, is sufficient to afford a basis for the conviction and the mere fact that extraneous matter not necessary for the conviction was also called in aid would not affect (1) ; 819 the result.
But as a matter of fact the foundation for this attack is based upon incorrect assumptions.
We will deal with Jit Singh, P.W. 2, first.
He supported the prosecution case in his examination inchief but resiled when cross examined.
He was therefore treated as hostile and the learned Public Prosecutor was permitted to cross examine him.
In cross examination the witness 's statement in the Committal Court was read out to him and he was asked whether he had made such a statement and he said: ""Yes.
"" When that statement is read it is found to tally with his evidence in chief and with the depositions of Balbir Singh and Jaswant Singh and with the first information report.
Now it was not necessary to use the former statement as substantive evi dence at all and the fact that the learned High Court Judges placed this on a par with the statements to the police, including of course the first information report, indicates that they were not using the former statements as substan tive evidence but merely as corroboration of what was said in chief.
The distinction is a subtle one and can perhaps be best explained in the following way.
A witness is called and he says in chief, ""I saw the accused shoot X"".
In cross examination he resiles and says ""I did not see it at all.
"" He is then asked ""but didn 't you tell A, B & C on the spot that you had seen it ?"" He replies ""yes, I did.
"" We have, of set purpose, chosen as an illus tration a statement which was not reduced to writing and which was not made either to the police or to a magistrate.
Now, the former statement could not be used as substantive evidence.
It would only be used as corroboration of the evidence in chief under section 157 of the Evidence Act or to shake the witness 's credit or test his veracity under section 146, Section 145 is not called into play at all in such a case.
Resort to section 145 would only be necessary if the witness denies that he made the former statement.
In that event, it would be necessary to prove that he did, and if the 820 former statement was reduced to writing, then section 145 requires that his attention must be drawn to those parts which are to be used for contradiction.
But that position does not arise when the witness admits the former statement.
In such a case all that is necessary is to look to the former statement of which no further proof is necessary because of the admission that it was made.
Of course, that statement cannot be used as substantive evidence unless section 988 of the Criminal Procedure Code is called in aid.
But even without section 288 a Court would be entitled to say in such a case, basing on the evidence in chief, which is substantive evidence.
that what the witness said to the police, or to the Committing Magistrate, is the true version, not because those statements form substantive evidence but.
because they tally with the evidence in chief which is substantive.
This is only one of the many ways in which a witness 's testimony can be sifted and examined.
Corroboration is as useful to test the truth of a story as any other method.
In such a case, what the Court really does, though it may happen to put the matter the other way round, is to say that in its opinion the substantive evi dence given in chief is true because it is corroborated by an earlier statement and for that reason, namely because the version in chief is the true one the contradictory version given in cross examination is wrong, not because of the contradiction embodied in the former statement but because of what was said in chief, a version which it is now safe to believe on account of the corroboration afforded by the earlier statement.
It is true the earlier statement could also have been used for contradicting the version given in crossexamination and in that event, if it is in writing, the limitations imposed by section 145 of the Evidence Act would have to be observed, but the prosecution is not bound to do that.
It has a choice.
It can, if it so chooses, build up the version given in chief in any way it pleases and, having done that, use the version in chief to destroy the version in cross examination.
821 But in the case before us there is no need to resort to these subtleties because here the depositions were brought on record and could be used as substantive evidence even if the formalities prescribed by section 145 of the Evidence Act were not observed for the very simple reason that there was no need in this cause to resort to section 145.
As we have said, the prosecution had a choice here because of the two conflicting versions given in chief and in crossexami nation.
It was entitled to use the former statement either to contradict what was said in crossexamination or to corroborate what was said in chief.
In either event, sec tion 288 of the Criminal Procedure Code could be used to make the former statement substantive evidence because what the section says is ""subject to the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act,"" and not subject to any particular section in it.
Section 157 is as much a provision of the Indian Evi dence Act as section 145 and if the former statement can be brought in under section 157 it can be transmuted into substantive evidence by the application of section 288.
Tara Singh vs The State(1) is to be distinguished because there, there were no two versions in the course of the same testimony.
The witness in question was hostile from the start in the Sessions Court and the whole purpose of resort ing to section 288 was to contradict what he said there and no question of corroboration arose.
The prosecution had no choice there, as it was here, of using the former statement either to contradict or to corroborate.
We turn next to Jagir Singh, P.W. 4.
In his case there was no choice.
He was hostile from the start and in his ease our observations in the ruling just referred to apply in full.
But on an examination of his evidence we find that the formalities prescribed by section 145 were complied with.
His cross examination, in contrast to Jit Singh 's where such a procedure was not necessary.
shows that every circumstance intended to be used as contradiction was put to him point by point and passage by passage.
That was (1) ; at 743.
822 conceded, but it was argued that this was done without drawing the witness 's attention to the parts of the writing which were to be used for the purposes of contradiction.
We are by no means satisfied that is the ease because at least one of the passages is reproduced in inverted commas and so must have been read out from the statement.
But that apart.
Immediately after the witness had been questioned about each separate fact point by point, the whole statement was read out to him and he admitted that he had made it in the Committing Court.
Now this procedure may be open to objection when the previous statement is a long one and only one or two small passages in it are used for contradiction that may, in a given case, confuse a witness and not be a fair method of affording him an opportunity to explain but in the present case the previous statement is a short one and the witness was questioned about every materi al passage in it point by point.
Accordingly, the procedure adopted here was in substantial compliance with what sec tion 145 requires.
There can be no hard and fast rule.
All that is required is that the witness must be treated fairly and be afforded a reasonable opportunity of explaining the contradictions after his attention has been drawn to them in a fair and reasonable manner.
We are satisfied that was done here.
The matter is one of substance and not of mere form.
Jit Singh, P.W. 2, said that the statement made by him in the committal proceedings was not read over to him and so did Jagir Singh, P.W. 4.
It was argued that in the absence of an enquiry that must be accepted as true, and if true, the evidence becomes inadmissible.
Now the certificate of the Committing Magistrate en dorsed on the deposition sheet states that the deposition was read out to the witness and that the witness admitted it to be correct.
The Court is bound to accept this as correct under section 80 of the Indian Evidence Act until it is proved to be untrue.
The burden is on 823 the person seeking to displace the statutory presumption and if he chooses to rely on the testimony of a witness which the Court is not prepared to believe the matter ends there.
The duty of displacing the presumption lies on the person who questions it.
The Court is of course bound to consider such evidence as is adduced but it is not bound to believe such evidence nor is there any duty whatever on the Court to conduct an enquiry on its own.
There is nothing in this point.
But we again wish to discountenance the suggestion that the Committing Magistrate should have been examined to prove the truth of his certificate and we endorse the re marks we made in Kashmera Singh vs The State of Madhya Pradesh (1) based on the decision of the Privy Council in Nazir Ahmad vs King Emperor(2) regarding the undesirability of any such practice.
But even if the fact be true that the deposition was not read over, that would only amount to a curable irregularity and, as the Privy Council observed in Abdul Rahman vs King Emperor (3), in the absence of prejudice which must be disclosed in an affidavit which shows exactly where the record departs from what the witness actually said, there is no point in the objection.
The object of the reading over prescribed by section 360 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not to enable the witness to change his story but to ensure that the record faithfully and accurately embodies the gist of what the witness actually said.
Therefore, before prejudice can be substantiated on this score, it must be disclosed by affidavit exactly where the inaccuracy lies.
The next and last objection is on similar lines.
Jit Singh, P.W. 2., and Jagir Singh, P.W. 4, said that their statements before the Committing Magistrate were made under the threats and duress of the police.
It was argued that that should not have been rejected without further enquiry, and a ruling in which a further enquiry was considered necessary was cited.
Here (1) ; (2) A.I.R. 1936 P.C. 253 at 258.
(3) A.I.R 1927 P.C. 44 at 45 47.
107 824 again, it is no part of a Court 's duty to enter upon a roving enquiry in the middle of a trial on matters which are collateral to the main issue.
The burden is on the person making these allegations to substantiate them and if he chooses to rely on evidence.which does not satisfy the Court he must ' suffer the same fate as every other person who is unable to discharge an onus which the law places upon him.
It was also argued that there was no proper compliance with the provisions.
of section 342 of the Criminal Proce dure Code.
We are satisfied that there was substantial compliance in this case.
The facts were simple and few and the crucial matters were brought to the attention of the appellant.
In any event, the learned counsel was unable to tell us even at the argument stage exactly how his client was prejudiced and tell us what answers his client would have given to the questions which, according to counsel, ought to have been put to the appellant.
We pressed him several times to disclose that but he was unable to do so.
As we said at the outset, the case is a very simple one in which a man was caught red handed with a pistol still in his hand and in which the first information report was recorded practically on the spot within 15 minutes of the occurrence.
The murder was committed in day light and there was no dearth of eye witnesses.
Two have been believed, and in the case of the other two, certain statements made by them in the Sessions Court resiling from statements previ ously recorded in the committal proceedings have been disbe lieved.
The appeal fails and is dismissed.
We see no reason to interfere with the sentence of death.
Appeal dismissed.

Appeal from a judgment and decree dated the 9th April, 1947, of the High Court of Judicature at Patna (Manohar Lal and Mukherjee JJ.) in First Appeal No. 68 of 1944 arising out of judgment and decree dated the 23rd December, 1943, of the Court of the First Additional Subordinate Judge, Gaya, in Suit No. 4 of 1941.

May 16.
FAZAL ALI J.
This appeal arises out of a suit for partition which was dismissed by the trial court but was decreed by the High Court of Patna on appeal.
The material facts of the case are briefly as follows: One Rambilas Das had 2 sons, Budparkash Das and Nandki shore Das Nandkishore Das had several sons, the plaintiff, Gurtahl Das being one of his illegitimate sons.
The present suit was brought by Gurtahl Das against 4 persons, namely, Gurnarayan Das and Jai Narayan Das, sons of Nandkishore Das, Shibtahl Das, who was alleged to be one of the illegitimate sons of Nandkishore Das, and Mst.
Rambholi Kuer, wife of Nanaksharan Das, one of the sons off Nandkishore Das.
Anoth er person, Kuldip Das, who was the daughter 's son of Nandki shore 's brother, Budparkash Das, intervened in the suit after its institution and was impleaded as the fifth defend ant.
After the death of the second defendant, Jai Narayan Das, his wife, Surat Kuer, was brought on record.
The plaintiff 's case was that Budparkash Das and Nandki shoreDas formed a joint Hindu .family, and that Budparkash Das died without any male issue in a state of jointness with his brother, Nandkishore, with the result that the entire joint family property devolved on him.
Subsequently, dis putes arose regarding the management and enjoyment of the properties among the plaintiff and the defendants, which compelled the plaintiff to institute the present suit for partition.
The plaintiff alleged that the parties were Sudras and belonged to the Nanak Shai sect of Fakirs, and that he and the third defendant, Shibtahl Das, were dasipu tras of Nandkishore Das by a concubine, and Jai Narayan Das and Gurnarayan Das were also dasiputras of Nandkishore by another concubine.
The suit was contested mainly by the first defendant, Gurnarayan Das, and Mst.
Surat Kuer, on the following pleas : firstly, that the suit was not maintainable as a suit for partition, because the plaintiff was never 871 in possession of the properties of which he claimed parti tion, secondly that the family of the defendants were not Sudras but Dwijas and an illegitimate son could not sue for partition, thirdly that the defendants did not form a joint Hindu family with the plaintiff and Shibtahl Das, fourthly that Mst.
Rambholi Kuer was not the widow of Nanaksharan Das, and fifthly that the plaintiff and Shibtahl Das were not sons of Nandkishore Das.
The case of Mst.
Rambholi Kuer was that the parties were Dwijas and not Sudras, and defend ant No. 5, Kuldip Das, pleaded to the same effect and fur ther alleged that Budparkash Das was separate from Nandki shore Das, that although they did not divide the properties by metes and bounds, they used to divide the produce half and half, and that he was in possession of his share of the properties as the daughter 's son of Budparkash Das and they could not be made the subject of partition.
Shibtahl Das supported the claim of the plaintiff.
The trial court dismissed the suit, holding, among other things, (1) that the plaintiff not being in joint possession of any of the properties, the suit for partition was not maintainable, (2) that the parties were Sudras, (3) that Budparkash Das and Nandkishore Das were joint and not sepa rate, (4) that the plaintiff had no cause of action, and (5) that Shibtahl Das had not proved that he was the son of Nandkishore.
Against the decision of the trial court, the plaintiff preferred an appeal to the High Court at Patna, and Kuldip Das filed a cross objection contesting the find ing that Budparkash was joint with his brother, Nandkishore.
The High Court reversed the decision of the trial court and held (1)that the parties were Sudras and not Dwijas, (2) that Budparkash died in a state of separation from his brother, Nandkishore, and (3) that no suit for declaration of title was necessary and the plaintiff 's failure to pay sufficient court fee should not stand in the way of suitable relief being granted to him.
Both the High Court and the trial court found that defendants Nos. 1 and 2, Gurnarayan Das and 113 872 Jai Narayan Das were the legitimate sons of Nand kishore Das.
On the above findings, the High Court passed a prelimi nary decree directing that separate allotments of the properties should be made to the plaintiff and the defend ants excepting Shibtahl Das.
It was contended before us on behalf of the first appel lant that the finding of the courts below that the parties were Sudras was not correct and should be set aside.
This contention must however fail, since we find no good reason for departing from the wellestablished practice of this court of not disturbing concurrent findings of the trial court and the first appellate court.
In the present case, the finding that the parties are Sudras is largely based on the oral evidence, and the learned Judges of the High Court in arriving at their conclusion have not over looked the tests which have been laid down in a series of authoritative decisions for determining the question whether a person belongs to the regenerate community or to the Sudra community.
The next question which was very seriously debated before us was whether Budparkash Das and Nandkishore Das were joint or separate.
On this question, the two courts below have expressed conflicting views, but on a careful consideration of the evidence before us, we are in clined to agree with the learned Judges of the High Court, who after reviewing the entire evidence have come to the conclusion that Budparkash Das died in a state of separation from Nandkishore.
It will be material to quote here the following extract from the judgment of the trial judge in which he sums up the evidence on this question : ""From the oral evidence on the record, this much is quite clear that Budparkash lived in a separate house and used to get crops.
This defendant (defendant No. 5, Kuldip Das) has also filed Exhibit B(2) chaukidari receipt for 1936 (Register No. 283) and Exhibit C 1 (copy of Assessment Register showing No. 284 in the name of Budparkash) which may go to show that possibly Budparkash was paying separate chowkidari tax, The defendant No. 5 has also filed some 873 letters marked A 1, A 5, A 4, A 6, A 10 and A 12, which not only show that this defendant is related to the defendants ' family, but also that grains and money were offered to him from time to time.
But none of these documents clearly show that there had been partition between Budparkash and Nandkishore or that the defendant No. 5 ever came in possession over any property, as being the heir of Bud parkash.
Of course there is some oral evidence to support him.
But I do not think, on considering and weighing the evidence that separation of Budparkash from Nandkishore has been proved.
The learned pleader for the defendant No, 5 has urged that the circumstances considered in the light of the ruling reported in Behar Report, Vol. 4 (1937 38) Privy Council at p. 302, would support the defendant 's case as there was defined share of Budparkash and Nandkishore in the Khatyan (exts.
G1 and G2).
I am not prepared to agree with the learned pleader on this point, as there is not a scrap of paper to show that Budparkash or even after him Kuldip Das separately appropriated the usufruct of any property, or ever Budparkash showed any intention of separation, I expect that if Budparkash had separated, at least on his death the defendant No. 5 would have maintained an account book of his income from the properties in dispute, specially as he lived at a distant place.
He does not appear to have ever cared to look after the property or demand accounts from his alleged co sharers.
"" This summary of the evidence shows firstly, that the two brothers lived in separate houses, secondly, that they paid separate chaukidari taxes, and thirdly, that Budparkash used to get grains and money from Nandkishore from time to time.
The trial judge has also observed that the khatyans, exhib its G 1 and G 2 record the defined shares of the two broth ers, but the printed record shows that exhibits G 1 and G 2 are mere rent receipts.
As the khatyan was not printed, we sent for the original record and found that the entries in the khatyan, which are exhibits F 1 and , have been correctly noted in the judgment of the trial court.
It seems to us therefore that the findings which we have set out give greater support to the oral evidence adduced on behalf of defendant No. 5 than to the evidence adduced by the other parties, and that being so, we think that the finding of the High Court must be upheld.
We were greatly impressed by several letters of exhibit A series, which have been found to be genuine by both the courts below.
The genuineness of the letters was attacked before us, but we find no good reason for reversing the findings of the trial judge and the High Court.
In one of these let ters, exhibit A 10, Nandkishore Das writing to Kuldip on the 12th June, 1934, states that he was sending 25 maunds of rice, 7 maunds of khesari and rupees seventy five and then adds: ""I have got with me all the accounts written, which will be explained when you will come and you will render a just account of your share when you come"".
In another letter, exhibit A 12, which was written by Nandkishore to Kuldip on the I5th October, 1936, the former states: ""I wrote to you several times to adjust account of your share, but you did not do so up till now.
I write to you to come and examine the account of your share.
I have not got money now.
If you have got time, then come for a day and have the account adjusted and take what may be found due to you"".
It seems to us that if the parties were really joint in the legal sense of the term, there was no question of examining the accounts and adjusting them, and there would have been no reference to the share of Kuldip in the produce or the money collected.
The proper conclusion to be arrived at is, as the witnesses for defendant No. 5 have stated, that though there was no partition by metes and bounds, the two brothers were divided in status and enjoyed the usufruct of the properties according to their respective shares.
Several witnesses were examined on behalf of de fendant No. 5, who have stated from their personal knowledge that the two brothers lived in separate houses, were sepa rate in mess and the produce 875 was divided between them half and half.
It seems to us that the finding of the High Court as to the separation of the two brothers must be upheld.
The third contention urged on behalf of the appellants relates to the question whether the plaintiff is entitled only to maintenance or to a share in the properties left by Nandkishore Das.
The rights of an illegitimate son of a Sudra are considered in Mitaksbara Ch. 1, section 12, which is headed ""Rights of a son by a female slave, in the case of a Sudra 's estate"".
This text was fully considered by the Privy Council in Vellaiyappa vs Natarajan(1) and the conclu sions derived therefrom were summarized as follows : ""Their Lordships are of opinion that the illegitimate son of a Sudra by a continuous concubine has the status of a son, and that he is a member of the family; that the share of inheritance given to him is not merely in lieu of maintenance, but in recognition of his status as a son; that where the father has left no separate property and no legitimate son, but was joint with his collaterals, the illegitimate son is not entitled to demand a partition of the joint family property in their hands, but is entitled as a member of the family to maintenance out of that property."" This statement of the law, with which we agree, may be supplemented by three other well settled principles, these being firstly, that the illegitimate son does not acquire by birth any interest in his father 's estate and he cannot therefore demand partition against his father during the latter 's lifetime; secondly, that on his father 's death, the illegitimate son succeeds as a coparcener to the separate estate of the father along with the legitimate son(s) with a right of survivorship and is entitled to enforce partition against the legitimate son(s); and thirdly, that on a parti tion between a legitimate and an illegitimate son, the illegitimate son takes only one half of What he would have taken if he was a legitimate son.
(1) A.I.R. 1931 P.C. 294.
876 It seems to us that the second proposition enunciated above follows from the following passage in the Mitakshara text : ""But after the demise of the father, if there be sons of a wedded wife, let these brothers allow the son of the female slave to participate for half a share.
"" If therefore the illegitimate son is a coparcener with the legitimate son of his father, it must necessarily follow that he is entitled to demand partition against the legiti mate son.
There can be no doubt that though the illegitimate son cannot enforce partition during the father 's lifetime and though he is not entitled to demand partition where the father has left no separate property and no legitimate son but was joint with his collaterals, he can enforce partition in a case like the present, where the father was separate from his collaterals and has left separate property and legitimate sons.
The last point put forward on behalf of the appellants was that the plaintiff not being in possession of the properties which are the subject of the suit, he cannot maintain a suit for partition.
This contention cannot prevail, because the plaintiff is undoubtedly a cosharer in the properties and unless exclusion and ouster are pleaded and proved, which is not the case here, is entitled to partition.
Thus, all the points urged on behalf of the appellants fail, but, in one respect, the decree of the High Court must be modified.
To appreciate this, reference will have to be made to the following statements made by defendant No. 5 in paragraphs 8 and 11 of his written statement: ""8.
That this defendant holds moiety share in jagir and kasht lands.
Mahanth Budh Parkash Das was living separately in the northern house allotted to him and the southern portion was allotted to the thakhta of Nandkishore Das, the smallest house divided into 2 havelis.
877 11.
That this defendant has nothing to do with the eight annas interest in the properties given in schedule under than C and D relating to jagir and kasht lands, which rightfully belonged to Nandkishore Das and has no concern with the properties noted in those schedules.
"" Paragraph 11 is rather ambiguously worded, but it was conceded before us by the counsel for defendant No. 5 that the latter had no claim to any interest in the properties set out in schedules other than schedules C and D. Such being the purport of paragraphs 8 and 11, the decree should provide that defendant No. 5 will be entitled only to a share in the properties set out in schedules C and D and will have no share in the properties set out in the other schedules.
Subject to this modification, the decree of the High Court is affirmed, and this appeal is dismissed.
There will be no order as to costs.
Appeal dismissed.

","Under Hindu law, though an illegitimate son of a Sudra cannot enforce partition during his father 's lifetime, he can enforce partition after his father 's death if the father was separate from his collaterals and has left separate property and legitimate sons.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MUKHERJEA J.
The sanctity which orthodox Hindu thought and feeling attribute to visiting of sacred places is nowhere better illustrated than in the vast concourse of pilgrims, who are attracted every year, from all parts of India, to the mountain shrines at Badrinath, situated, high up in the Himalayas, in the District of Garhwal.
The place to which the appellation of 'Puri ' is given, contains a number of temples but the principal temple is the one where the idol Badrinath along with some other subsidiary idols is installed.
This main temple is divided into three por tions or apartments, and to the innermost portion which is considered to be the holiest and where the deities are located, no pilgrim is allowed access.
The pilgrims gather in the middle room; they have 'darshan ' or look at the deity from this place and there also they make their offerings and perform other rites of individual worship.
The last room is an outer apartment which is used as a sort of waiting place for the worshippers.
Outside the temple and at a short distance from it, there is a hot spring known as Tapta Kundu where the worshippers take ceremonial bath before they enter into the temple and to the Tapta Kundu they come back again after the ceremonies are over.
The temple at Badrinath is an ancient institution and is admittedly a public place of worship for the Hindus.
The chief priest or ministrant of the temple is known by the name of 'Rawal ' who originally looked after both the spirit ual and temporal affairs of the idol subject to certain rights of supervision and control exercisable by the Tehri Durbar which, however, were not very clearly defined.
It appears that there was a scheme for the management of the temple framed by the Commissioner of Kumaun Division, within whose jurisdiction Badrinath is situated, some time in the year 1899.
Under this scheme, the 'Rawal ' was to be the sole 851 trustee of the Badrinath temple and its properties, and the entire management was entrusted to him subject to his keeping accounts, which he had to submit for approval by the Tehri Durbar, and making arrangements for the disposal and safe custody of cash receipts and other non perishable valuables.
This scheme apparently did not work well and led to constant friction between the 'Rawal ' on the one hand and the Tehri Durbar on the other.
This unsatisfactory state of affairs led to public agitation and demand for reforms, and in 1939, the U.P.Legislature passed the Sri Badrinath Temple Act, the object of which was to remove the chief defects in the existing system of management.
The Act restricts the ' Rawal ' to his priestly duties and the secular management is placed in the hands of a small committee, the members of which are partly elected and partly nominated, powers being reserved to the Government to take steps against the commit tee itself, if it is found guilty of mismanagement.
The Act preserves the traditional control of the Tehri Durbar.
The appellants before us, who were the plaintiffs in the trial Court, claim to be Pandas associated with the Badri nath temple.
The Pandas are Brahmans belonging to the priestly class and are found to exist in almost all impor tant public places of worship in India.
They are not temple priests in the proper sense of the expression and have nothing to do with the regular worship of the idol which is carried on by the Shebayat, the High Priest or the manager as the case may be.
Their chief duty consists in acting as guides or escorts of the pilgrims, and taking them to var ious places of worship acquainting them at the same time with detailed information regarding the reputed sanctity of each.
They look after the comforts of the pilgrims and make arrangements for their boarding and lodging and also act as Tirtha Purohits, in which capacity they assist the pilgrims in the performance of various acts of individual worship as distinguished from the general worship which is conducted by or on behalf of the temple authorities.
852 It is admitted that there are several classes of Pandas in Badrinath and the Deoprayagi Pandas to which category the plaintiffs belong get normally the charge of all the pil grims that come from the plains, whereas the Pandas of the 'Dimri ' class act as attendants on all hill people.
the people coming to Badrinath from the plains generally follow the pilgrim 's route from.
Hardwar to Badrinath and in this route, at a distance of about 58 miles from Hardwar, stands the place known as Deoprayag where all the Deoprayagi Pandas reside.
It is in the light of these few introductory facts that we propose to follow the history of this litigation and deal with the points in controversy that it has given rise to.
The suit was commenced by the appellants in the Court of the Senior Civil Judge of Garhwal on 16th April, 1934, and the only defendant in the suit, as it was filed originally, was the 'Rawal ' who was at that time in entire charge of the Badrinath institution, both as Trustee and High Priest.
The suit was a representative one and purported to be brought on behalf of all the Deoprayagi Pandas, and permission of the Court under Order I, rule 8, of the Civil Procedure Code was duly taken.
The allegations in the plaint in substance are that the plaintiffs who are a body of Brahman Purohits residing at Deoprayag and also at Badrinath have the right, by immemorial custom, to act as Pandas and 'Tirtha Purohits ' of the pilgrims at Badrinath.
It is said that in performance of their duties they meet the pilgrims at Hardwar and con duct them throughout the pilgrimage to different places of sanctity and finally to Badrinath itself.
Besides looking to their creature comforts, they assist the pilgrims, while they stay at Badrinath, in having their ceremonial ablutions in the 'Tapta Kundu ' and then conduct them into the pre cincts of the temple and assist them in having 853 'darshan ' of the idols and making offerings to them.
The plaintiffs aver that because of the support that they lent to the transfer of the management of the temple from the 'Rawal ' to the Tehri Durbar, the defendant 'Rawal ' was displeased with them and in August 1933, wrongfully and without any just cause or excuse.
obstructed and threatened to obstruct the plaintiffs from entering the precincts of the temple along with their Yajmans or clients and unlawful ly restrained them from assisting the pilgrims in the usual way at the time of 'darshan ' and worship of the deities inside the temple.
The reliefs prayed for in the plaint after it was amended stand as follows : (1) That a declaration be granted that the plaintiffs are the Pandas of Badrinath temple and that they have a right to personally go into the precincts of the Badrinath temple at all times and on all occasions without obstruction when the said temple is open for doing 'darshan ', worship etc.
(2) That the plaintiffs have the right freely to go into the precincts of the said temple with their Yajmans or clients whenever it is open for assisting them in the matter of 'darshan ' or worship of God Badrinarayan and other dei ties and in the matter of making offerings to them.
(3) That the plaintiffs have the right to take within the precincts of the said temple whatever is put into their hands as gift by their clients at the time of worship etc.
(4) That a perpetual injunction be issued restraining the defendant 'Rawal ' from interfering with the immemorial rights of the plaintiffs.
The defendant, in his written statement, admitted that the Pandas did sometimes accompany rich pilgrims as their guides and receive presents from them for the services they rendered.
It was also admitted that the plaintiffs in their individual capacity as Hindus had the right to enter the temple of Badrinath for purposes of worship.
It was assert ed, however, 854 that it was neither necessary nor desirable that the plaintiffs should. be allowed to accompany their Yajmans or clients into the temple, as the defendant himself made adequate arrangements for 'darshan ' and worship by the.pilgrims; and he, as the sole trustee and manager of the temple, had the right to regulate entry into the temple so that over crowding might be avoided and order maintained inside it.
It was further pleaded that the suit of the plaintiffs was barred by res judicata and the law of limita tion.
On these pleadings, two issues of a preliminary nature were framed by the Civil Judge, one of them being, whether the plaintiffs ' suit was barred by res judicata.
This issue was decided against the plaintiff and the Civil Judge dis missed the suit on 18 9 1934 holding that the suit was barred by the rule of res judicata, as an earlier suit brought by five of the Deoprayagi Pandas and claiming iden tical reliefs against the 'Rawal ' was dismissed by the Commissioner of the Kumaun Division in the year 1896.
Against this order of dismissal, an appeal was taken by the plaintiffs to the High Court of Allahabad and a Division Bench of the High Court, by its judgment dated 23rd May, 1938, reversed the decision of the Civil Judge on this preliminary point and remanded the case for hearing of the suit on its merits.
The case then went back before the Civil Judge and while it was still pending, the Sri Badrinath Temple Act was passed.
A temple committee being formed in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
the said committee through its Secretary, was impleaded as Defendant No. 2 in the suit.
The committee filed a fresh written statement in which certain additional grounds were taken.
It was contended primarily that the suit as framed, was not maintainable by reason of the provisions of Sri Badrinath Temple Act of 1939, which abrogated all previous rights and customs and vested the ownership of the temple and its endowments in the temple committee.
It was asserted, further, that all gifts made within the precincts of the temple would vest in the temple 855 committee under section 3(b) of the Act and that the commit tee had the absolute right to regulate entry of persons inside the temple.
A number of issues were framed after this written state ment was filed, and on hearing the evidence adduced by the parties, the Civil Judge disposed of the suit by his judg ment dated 4th March, 1941.
The suit was decreed in part and the plaintiffs were given a declaration in their favour on one of the points in an attenuated and restricted form.
Besides certain pleas in bar which were raised by the de fendants in their written statements and in regard to which the trial judge 's decision was in favour of the plaintiffs, the substantial controversy between the parties centred round the two following points: (1) Whether the Deoprayagi Pandas could accompany their Yajmans or clients inside the temple and assist them in the 'darshan ' and worship of the deities (2) Whether the Pandas would have the right to accept within the precincts of the temple whatever was paid by the pilgrims as gifts or presents to them and not to the temple ? As regards the first point, the learned Civil Judge reviewed the entire evidence relating to the practice of admitting the Pandas along with their Yajmans inside the temple, as it obtained from very early times down to the date of the institution of the suit.
It appears that in 1892 certain rules were framed by the then 'Rawal ' for regulation of pilgrims in the Badrinath temple, and to these rules the Commissioner of Kumaun Division accorded his sanction on 4th July, 1892.
One of these rules, namely Rule (3), expressly laid down that ""at the time of 'darshan ' by the pilgrims, no other persons and Pandas shall be allowed to go inside the temple along with the pilgrims"".
On 22nd October, 1894, an application was filed before the Commissioner of Kumaun Division by some residents of Deoprayag complaining of unjust prohibition from entering the temple by the new manager and it was prayed that directions might 111 856 be given to the said Manager to desist from encroaching upon the time honoured rights of the Pandas.
On 28th October 1894, the Commissioner ordered that a copy of the petition might be sent to the Manager.
for report and in the body of the order he recorded his opinion that ""the duty of the Pandas consists normally in escorting the pilgrims to the temple precincts.
Their entering the temple can be permitted when they did so as pilgrims.
"" The petition was eventually rejected, and on 19th August, 1895.
five Deopray agi Pandas filed a suit in the Court of the Deputy Collec tor, Garhwal, who was invested with the powers of a Civil Court, praying for a declaration of their right to go inside the temple with their Yajmans which the 'Rawal ' was not willing to allow unless he gave special permission.
The trial court allowed the plaintiffs ' prayer but, on appeal, the judgment was reversed and the suit was dismissed.
This order of dismissal was affirmed on Second Appeal by the Commissioner of Kumaun Division who had the powers of a High Court in regard to this area, by his order dated 9th March, 1896.
This is the earlier decision on the strength of which the plea of res judicata was taken by the defend ant in the present suit.
According to the learned Civil Judge, after the rules as mentioned above were framed in 1892 and the judgment of the Commissioner, Kumaun Division, in the Civil Suit was given in 1896, it was the 'Rawal ' who decided whether or not he would give permission to any particular Panda to go inside the temple as an escort of his Yajmans and practice was almost uniform on this point down to the year 1903.
The same practice prevailed, according to the learned Judge, from 1903 to 1920.
From 1921, however, the practice became lax to a great extent and from the evidence of respectable witnesses examined on behalf of the plaintiffs, the learned Judge was of opinion that in many cases the Pandas were able to go inside the temple without any let or hindrance and without seeking any express permission from the 'Rawal '.
A definite challenge to the rights of the Pandas occurred again in 1933 which led 857 to the institution of the present suit.
After reviewing this evidence, the learned Civil Judge discussed the provi sions of the Shri Badrinath Temple Act bearing on this point ,and summed up his conclusions as follows: ""In my view under the scheme of the Shri Badrinath Act, the Pandas or pilgrims have no absolute right to go inside the temple, regardless of the conditions imposed by the Committee about entry into the temple, but ordinarily in the entry of the pilgrims or Pandas is in accordance with the rules or bye laws framed by the Committee the pilgrims can always go inside accompanied by their Pandas, who are enti tled as devout Hindus to go inside the temple, and perform worship there, and can assist their Yajmans also.
In other words, there is no right of the plaintiffs which has to be recognised, and can be recognised, on the grounds of custom, usage, or otherwise, that they can without any let or hin drance and regardless of the conditions imposed by the Committee, enter the temple with the pilgrims whenever they like.
Like other pilgrims, and persons who are all subject to the control of the conditions that may be imposed by the Committee, the Deoprayagi Pandas can also enter the temple, perform worship there, and even help their Yajmans who happen to be inside the temple.
To lay down an absolute prohibition against them would not be in accordance with the provisions of Shri Badrinath Temple Act, and similarly to recognise that they have an absolute right to enter the temple with the pilgrims, would also nullify a number of provisions in the Shri Badrinath Temple Act.
Issue No. 2 is decided accordingly in the negative, but subject to recogni tion of the conditional right of the plaintiffs to accompany their pilgrims and help them in the 'darshan ', as mentioned above subject to the control of the Committee.
"" In spite of this finding, which is certainly not very definite the Court dismissed in toto the plaintiffs ' prayer No. 2 in the plaint, the reason given being that 858 no absolute right as was claimed by the plaintiffs was established on the footing of a custom or otherwise.
As regards the other point, the learned Judge was of opin ion that although a Panda had no absolute right to go inside the temple along with his clients, yet if the commit tee or the temple authorities allowed him to do so, there was nothing in law or custom which could prevent him from accepting a gift which any pilgrim might desire to make in his favour.
The result was that the learned Judge gave the plaintiffs a declaration in the following terms : ""The plaintiffs ' suit is decreed for a declaration that they have a right to accept within the precincts of the temple whatever was put into their hands as gifts (Dan or Dakshina or Shankalp) by the pilgrims, for the benefit of the plaintiffs and not the temple, and to retain such gifts for their personal benefit.
This right is however subject to the administrative control of the temple committee so far as the maintenance of order and decency and the enforcement of proper behaviour within the temple are concerned.
The exercise of this right will further be restricted by any special or general conditions imposed by the Committee of management under any bye law framed by it in accordance with the provisions of Shri Badrinath Temple Act or any other special law that may hereafter be applicable to the temple.
"" The rest of the plaintiffs ' claim was dismissed.
Against this judgment, the plaintiffs took an appeal to the High Court of Allahabad.
The defendants also preferred cross objections challenging the propriety of that part of the trial Court 's decree which was in favour of the plain tiffs.
The appeal was heard by a Division Bench consist ing of Varma C.J. and Mathur J. and, by their judgment dated 22nd November, 1946, the learned Judges dismissed the plaintiffs ' appeal and allowed the cross objections filed by the defendants.
Thus, the decision resulted in a total dismissal of the plaintiffs ' suit.
It is from this judgment that the present appeal has come before us, 859 It was held by the High Court that the plaintiffs failed miserably to establish that there was any immemorial usage in existence under which they were entitled to accompany the pilgrims, as of right, inside the precincts of the temple.
It was held also that even if any such usage existed, that must be deemed to have been abrogated by the provisions of Shri Badrinath Temple Act, and reference was made in this connection to section 25 (1)(m) of the Act, which empowers the temple committee to frame bye laws not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act for the ""maintenance of order inside the temple and regulating the entry of persons there in.
"" It is to be noted that after the judgment of the trial court was delivered and the appeal came up for hearing before the High Court, the Badrinath Temple Committee passed a resolution which was approved of by the Governor of the U.P. State, and was to the following effect : ""Subject to the provision of bye laws and any direction given by the committee, the Pandas can accompany their Yajmans within the temple.
"" This resolution was communicated to the plaintiffs by the 2nd defendant by a letter dated 29th May, 1942, and undoubtedly after passing of this resolution, the grievance of the plaintiffs in regard to temple entry disappeared to a large extent.
The High Court however, refused to give the plaintiffs a declaration of their right in this respect even in a limited form as, in its opinion, the plaintiffs could not claim such declaration as a matter of right.
The view taken by the High Court seems to be that it is entirely for the committee to decide, whether the Pandas should be al lowed to enter the temple at all, and, if so, to what extent and under what conditions.
On the other question relating to the right of the plaintiffs to accept gifts made in their favour by the pilgrims within the precincts of the temple, it was held by the High Court that under section 3 (b) of the Shri Badri nath Temple Act, such gifts would become part of the endow ment,.
and the donees would be 860 incapable of laying any claim to the same.
It was further, held that bye law (8) of the Puja Bye laws framed by the temple committee which prevents a person other than those whose rights have been specifically recognised by the Committee, from receiving any gifts within the precincts of the temple, was quite a legitimate provision the making of which was within the rule making authority of the committee of management.
It was held, therefore, that in view of this rule, the plaintiffs ' claim in regard to receiving of gifts within the temple was not maintainable in law.
Mr.Iyengar, appearing in support of the appeal before us, has assailed the propriety of the High Court 's decision on both these points.
The first point that requires consideration is whether the plaintiffs can, on the facts admitted and found in this case, claim a declaration of their right to accompany the Yajmans or clients inside the Badrinath temple and assist them in having 'darshan ' of the deities and in performing such ceremonies as individual worshipers may perform.
Mr. Dar, who appears on behalf of the respondents, draws our attention to the fact that this right has practically been conceded by the temple committee in their resolution passed in March, 1942, referred to already, The learned counsel has very fairly stated.
to us that he would have no objection if the plaintiffs are given a declaration of their rights in this respect in some suitable form as might safeguard their.
interest, without in any way trenching upon the rights of temple committee and thereby obviate all disputes in the future.
It seems to us that the approach of the court below to this aspect of the case has not been quite proper, and, to avoid any possible misconception, we would desire to state succinctly what the correct legal position is.
Once it is admitted, as in fact ha.s been admitted in the present case, that the temple is a public place of worship of the Hindus, the right of entrance into the temple for purposes of 'darshan ' or worship is a right 861 which flows from the nature of the institution itself, and for the acquisition of such rights, no custom or in memorial usage need be asserted or proved.
As the Panda as well as his client are both Hindu worshippers.
there can be nothing wrong in the one 's accompanying the other inside the temple and subject to what we will state presently, the fact that the pilgrim, being a stranger to the spot, takes the assistance of the Panda in the matter of 'darshan ' or worship of the deities or that the landa gets remunera tion from his client for the services he renders, does not in any way affect the legal rights of either of them.
In law, it makes no difference whether one performs the act of worship himself or is aided or guided by another in the performance of them.
If the Pandas claim any special right which is not enjoyed ordinarily by members of the Hindu public, they would undoubtedly have to establish such rights on the basis of custom, usage or otherwise.
This right of entry into a public temple is, however, not an unregulated or unrestricted right.
It is open to the trustees of a public temple to regulate the time of public visits and fix certain hours of the day during which alone members of the public would be allowed access to the shrine.
The public may also be denied access to certain particularly sacred parts of the temple, e.g., the inner sanctuary or as it is said the Holy of Holies ' where the deity is actually located.
Quite apart from these, it is always competent to the temple authorities to make and enforce rules to ensure good order and decency of worship and prevent overcrowding in a temple.
Good conduct or orderly behaviour is always an obligatory condition of admission into a temple (1), and this principle has been accepted by and recognised in the Shri Badrinath Temple Act, section 25 of which provides for framing of bye laws by the temple committee inter alia for maintenance of order inside the temple and regulating the entry of persons within it(2).
(1) Vide Kalidas Jivram vs Gor Parjaram, I.L.R. 15 Bom.
p. 309; Thackeray vs Harbhum, I.L.R. 8 Bom.
p. 432.
(2) Vide Section 25 (1)(m).
862 The true position, therefore, is that the plaintiffs ' right of entering the temple along with their Yajmans is not a precarious or a permissive right depending for its existence upon the arbitrary discretion of the temple authorities; it is a legal right in the true sense of the expression but it can be exercised subject to the restrictions which the temple committee may impose in good faith for maintenance of order and decorum within the temple and for ensuring proper performance of customary worship.
In our opinion, the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration in this form.
We now come to the other point which is the real bone of contention between the parties to this appeal, and the question for consideration is whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that they have a right to take, within the precincts of the temple, whatever is put into their hands as gifts by their clients at the time of wor ship.
The trial court, as pointed out above, gave the plaintiffs a qualified declaration on this point, though the High Court rejected this claim altogether.
Mr. Iyengar has vehemently assailed the propriety of the grounds upon which the decision of the High Court rests, whereas Mr. Dar has contended inter alia that the claim of the plaintiffs under this head is wholly untenable in view of the provision of bye law (8) of the Puja Bye laws framed by the temple committee.
It may be stated at the outset that as the gift, if any, which a pilgrim might choose to make within the temple precincts is entirely a voluntary act on his part and as he could not be compelled to make a gift either in favour of the Pandas or anybody else, there could strictly speaking, be no legal right in the plaintiffs to receive any gift from his client which can be declared by a court of law.
The plaintiffs do accept the position that the pilgrims are not bound ' to give anything to the Pandas by way of Dakshina or sacrificial fee at the conclusion of the ceremonies in the temple; but what they say is this that if the pilgrims choose to make any gift to them, the temple committee could 863 not, in law, prevent the latter from accepting the same and treat such gifts as part of the temple property.
It is argued that bye law (8) of the Puja Bye laws is illegal and ultra vires and cannot take away the legal right of the donee to the gifted property under the ordinary law which has not been and cannot be affected in any way by the provi sions of the Sri Badrinath Temple Act.
A number of respectable witnesses examined on behalf of the plaintiffs do say that when they went on pilgrimage to Badrinath they made gifts to their Pandas inside the temple at the close of the ceremony of darshan and worship.
But the evidence taken, even at its face value, does not estab lish that the practice of making gifts to Pandas within the temple is a general one or that the pilgrims ,regard it as an indispensable part of the ceremony of worship; many of the witnesses plainly admit that they do not remember to have made any gifts at all within the temple precincts and others say that they paid dakshina or sacrificial fees to all the Brahmans who were found inside the temple at that time and not exclusively to their Pandas.
It is also stated that suphal or final blessing is Obtained from the Pandas by the pilgrims after making presents to them at the place called Tapta Kundu where the hot spring lies which is outside the temple.
Mr. Iyengar has drawn our attention to certain texts from the Kedar Kanda of Skanda Purana which describe the glory of the deity Badrinath, to show that it is a religious duty enjoined by the Hindu scriptures that a worshipper who goes to Badrikasram should make gifts to Brahmans after the darshan of the idol is obtained and offerings are made to it.
An English rendering of the passages relied upon by the learned counsel would read thus: ""After having bathed in the Ganges, in the Narada Hrada (Kund) and others (Hradas), one (worshipper) shall bathe in the Vahni Tirth ( Tapta Kunda) after performing the obliga tory duties and with his mind 112 864 kept under control, he shall go into the temple of Badri nath with his.
mind concentrated on Shri Hari.
He shall make offerings to the best of his capacity and with utmost devo tion.
Then he shall look at the All Pervading Narayana from crown to foot, and HERE make gifts to Brahmans to the best of his capacity.
Thereafter, he shall do PRADAKSHINA (go round) with the utmost devotion.
Then he shall come back to the Tirthas (Vahni Tirtha etc.) and make gifts according to his means""(1).
It cannot and is not disputed that according to ortho dox Hindu ideas, gift to Brahmans is considered as a merito rious act and there are texts, to some of which Mr. Iyengar drew our attention, which extol the merits of such gifts when made at a sacred place or within a temple or on the banks of a holy river.
It may be as Mr. Iyengar suggests that the idea of making gifts within the temple had its origin in the religious texts to which the learned counsel drew our attention.
But, the point that requires considera tion in the present case is a different and much narrower one.
The question is whether under the powers of making bye laws which are conferred by the Sri Badrinath Temple Act upon the managing committee, the latter could make a rule as they have done, by which all persons other than those whose rights are specifically recognised are disabled from receiv ing gifts within the precincts of the temple.
It is perfectly true that under the general law, nobody can be prevented from accepting a gift which another person may be inclined to make in his favour, and it is immate rial in such cases at what place the gift is actually made.
One has to enquire, therefore, on what grounds the committee can interdict the taking of any gifts within the temple precincts.
The High Court seems to be of opinion and this view is sought to be supported on behalf of the respondents before us that the Sri Badrinath Temple Act itself has in express (1) Skanda purana, Kedar Khand, Badri Mahatma, Chapter VI, Verses 46 49. 865 terms abrogated the rights of the donee in regard to a gift made to him within the ,temple and as such gifts come within the definition of 'endowment ' as given in the Act, the temple committee gets a controlling hand over them and can make any regulations in relation thereto.
Reliance is placed in this connection upon section a (b) of the Sri Badrinath Temple Act which lays down that the expression ""endowment"" in relation to the Act ""means all property moveable or immoveable belonging to or given or endowed for the maintenance or improvement of, or additions to, or worship in the temple, or for the performance of any service or charity connected therewith and includes the idols in stalled therein, the premises of the said temple and gifts of property made to anyone within the precints of the tem ple.
"" The definition is undoubtedly couched in very wide language but it is to be noted that under section 4 of the Act which deals with the vesting of property, a gift does not vest in the temple at all unless it is made for the benefit of the temple or for the convenience, comfort or benefit of the pilgrims.
It is conceded by Mr. Dar that a gift intended for the personal benefit of the Pandas cannot vest in the temple and this is quite in accordance with the existing principles of Hindu law.
He contends, however, that such gifts could not vest in the donee, as well, in accordance with the definition of ' 'endowment"" given in section a (b) of the Sri Badrinath Temple Act.
In other words, according to the interp","The right of the Deoprayagi Pandas to enter the Badri nath Temple along with their Yajmans is not a precarious or permissive right depending for its existence on the arbi trary discretion of the temple authorities; it is a legal right in the true sense of the expression, but it can be exercised only subject to the restrictions which the temple committee may impose in good faith for maintenance of order and decorum within the temple and for ensuring proper per formance of customary worship.
There is nothing in the Badrinath Temple Act, 1 939, which vests in the temple committee or the idol, gifts made to Pandas within the precincts of the temple.
But bye law (8) of the Puja Bye laws framed by the temple committee which forbids the acceptance of gifts by any person within the precincts of the temple unless he comes within the category of persons specifically authorised by the committee to receive the same is a valid bye law, which it was quite competent for the committee to enact under the terms of clauses (m) and (n) of sec.
25 of the Act and in view of this bye law the Pandas are not entitled to a declaration by the Court that they have a right to take, within the pre cincts of the temple, whatever they receive as gifts at the time of worship.

89.txt,"Civil Appeal No. 158 of 1951.
Appeal from the judgment and decree dated 24th March, 1948, of the High Court of Punjab at Simla (Teja Singh and Khosla JJ.) in Regular First Appeal No. 133 of 1945 arising out of judgment and decree dated 25th November, 1944, of the Court of the Senior Subordinate Judge, Kangra, at Dharmsala in Suit No. 86 of 1,943.
Daryadatta Chawla for the appellant.
Gurbachan Singh (Jindra Lat, with him) for the respond ent. 1952.
May 16.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by FAZL ALl J.
This is an appeal against the judgment and decree of the High Court of Punjab at Simla reversing the judgment and decree of the Senior Subordinate Judge of Kangra in a suit instituted by the appellant for a declara tion that he was the sole lawful heir of one Musammat Ram Piari, whom he alleged to be his wife, and as such was entitled to the properties left by her, and for possession of those properties.
The suit was instituted against 2 persons, namely, Parvin Kumari, who was alleged to be the daughter of the plaintiff by Ram Piari, and Shrimati Raj Kumari, who were respectively impleaded as defendants Nos. 1 and 2.
The case of the plaintiff as set out in the plaint was that he was married to Ram Piari, the daughter of an employ ee of Raj Kumari (defendant No. 2) about 22 years before the institution of the suit, that after marriage she lived with him at Hoshiarpur and gave birth to a daughter, Parvin Kumari (defendant No. 1), on the 4th March, 1929, and that Ram Piari died in 828 April, 1941, leaving both movable and immovable properties which she had acquired in her own name with the aid of his money and which had been taken possession of by Raj Kumari.
He further alleged that he was a Rajput by caste belonging to tehsil Garhshankar in the district of Hoshiarpur, and was governed by custom in matters of succession, and, according to that custom, he, as the husband of the deceased Ram Piari, was entitled to the movable and immovable properties left by her to the exclusion of Parvin Kumari, her daughter.
The suit was contested by both Parvin Kumari and Raj Kumari, and both of them denied that the appellant had been married to Ram Piari.
Their case was that the proper ties in suit were acquired by Raj Kumari with her own money for Ram Piari, that the latter had made a will bequeathing them to her daughter, Parvin Kumari, that the appellant was not governed by custom, and that in any event the alleged custom could not apply to the personal and self .
acquired property of Ram Piari, As regards 2 cars which were also included in the list of properties claimed in the plaint, the case of Raj Kumari was that they belonged to her and that the deceased was only a benamidar.
The trial court decreed the plaintiff 's suit with re spect to all the properties excepting the 2 cars which were held to belong to Raj Kumari.
The court held that Ram Piari was the legally married Wife of the appellant, that he was governed by customary law applicable to Rajputs of Hoshiar pur district in matters of succession, and that according to that customary law he was the preferential heir to the estate of Ram Piari.
The court further held that the will of Ram Piari was invalid as she had no power under the customary law to make a will.
Both the defendants appealed to the High Court against the judgment of the trial court, and the appeal was ulti mately allowed and the plaintiffs suit was dismissed.
The High Court held that though there 829 was evidence of long cohabitation of the plaintiff and Ram Piari giving rise to a presumption of marriage, yet that presumption had been completely rebutted and the proper conclusion to be arrived at on the evidence on record was that the plaintiff had not been able to prove that Ram Piari was his lawfully wedded wife.
As to custom, the findings of the High Court were as follows : (1) that the appellant belonged to an agricultural tribe of Hoshiarpur district and was therefore governed by the custom prevailing among the Rajputs of that district; (2) that there was no local or general custom allowing the plaintiff to succeed in preference to the daughter to the property left by Ram Piari which had been given to her by a stranger, namely, Raj Kumari, and (3) that the parties were governed by Hindu law under which Parvin Kumari being the daughter of Ram Piari was entitled to succeed to the properties left by the latter in preference to the plaintiff.
Against the decision of the High Court, the plaintiff has now preferred this appeal, after obtaining a certificate from the High Court under sections 109 and 110 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
The first question which arises in this appeal is wheth er the plaintiff has succeeded in proving that Ram Piari was his legally wedded wife.
The plaintiff was admittedly em ployed as a copyist in the District Judge 's court at Hoshi arpur and was living in that town.
His case was that he gained the acquaintance of Raj Kumari (defendant No. 2), a wealthy lady of Kangra district who owned a tea estate in tehsil Palampur and occasionally visited Hoshiarpur, and through her good offices was married to Ram Piari, who was the daughter of one Chandar Bit, an employee of Raj Kumari working in her tea estate.
After marriage, Ram Piari lived with the plaintiff at Hoshiarpur as his lawfully wedded wife, and a daughter, Parvin Kumari, (also called Usha Rani) was born to 830 them on the 4th March, 1929.
Raj Kumari had great attachment to wards Ram Piari and often used to pay visits to Hoshiar pur to meet her.
In the year 1934 35 (no date is mentioned in the plaint; but this year is mentioned in the plain tiff 's evidence), Raj Kumari took Ram Piari from the plain tiff 's house with belongings of every description on the pretext of taking her out for recreation.
Ram Piari did not like going round with Raj Kumari and though she wanted to come back to the plaintiff she had not the courage to diso bey Raj Kumari, and in fact Ram Piari and ' Raj Kumari in wardly hated one another during the last years of the for mer 's life.
In the year 1941, Ram Piari died at Mayo Hospi tal at Lahore, leaving the properties in dispute which had been acquired by her by good management with the plaintiff 's own money.
As against this version of the.
plaintiff, the case of Raj Kumari was that Ram Piari had been enticed away by a motor driver sometime in 1921, that she returned to Holta estate after about 11 years with Parvin Kumari who was then about 3 years old, and after her return both she and her daughter remained with her (Raj Kumari) till Ram Piari died in 1941.
Raj Kumari, being a widow, felt very lonely and so brought up Ram Piari as a companion and all the properties in dispute had been acquired by her with her own money for the benefit of Ram Piari Parvin Kumari had been educated and brought up at her expense, and it was entirely false that she and Ram Piari inwardly hated each other, the truth being that they liked and were attached to each other.
The evidence adduced by the plaintiff to prove that Ram Piari was his lawfully wedded wife consists partly of the evidence of a number of witnesses and partly of circumstan tial evidence.
The direct evidence of marriage is furnished by Babu Ram, P. W. 7, Anant Ram, P.W. 11, Babu, P.W. 12, and Asa Ram, P.W. 13.
Babu Ram claims to be the family priest and alleges to have officiated as priest at the time of the plaintiff 's marriage, Anant Ram and Asa Ram are 831 jaswal Rajputs residing in village Bham, which is near the plaintiff 's village, Ajnoha, and Babu is a barber.
These four persons have said that they accompanied the marriage party and that the marriage of the plaintiff with Ram Piari was celebrated in their presence.
The evidence of the other witnesses and the circumstantial evidence upon which reli ance has been placed by the plaintiff have been summarized by the learned Subordinate Judge in his judgment in these words : ""P. W. 5 Mukhi Ram is a Municipal Commissioner at Hoshi arpur.
P.W. 4 Doctor Shadi Lal is a leading Medical Practi tioner of Hoshiarpur.
P.W. 9 Lala Sham Lal and P.W. 10 Lala Har Narain have been co employees with the plaintiff in the same office; though these persons (except P.W. 9) have no social relations with the plaintiff and his family, yet they have been seeing Ram Piari living with plaintiff as his wife.
She was proclaimed as such by the plaintiff and both of them were treated as husband and wife by the people of the Mohalla and by the brotherhood in the village of plain tiff.
Exhibits P 18 and P 19 show that defendant No. 2 has been addressing Ram Piari, care of plaintiff in 1932 and has been receiving correspondence, care of the plaintiff which shows that she approved of the plaintiff 's alliance with Ram Piari .
Paras Ram, a younger brother of Ram Piari, lived in the house of Gokal Chand and it is in evidence that he used to address the plaintiff as jija a common name for sister 's husband.
From 1930 to 1934 Paras Ram read in the D.A.V. High School at Hoshiarpur and Exhibits P.W. 6/1 to 6 are copies of entries in the registers of the school regard ing applications which were given by Gokal Chand, plaintiff, for admission of his ward Paras Ram, son of Chandar Bit who was described as his sala (wife 's brother).
P.W. 6 Lala Bishan Das, teacher, has filed these copies.
His sister 's house was adjacent to the house of the plaintiff and he had occasions to see Ram Piari living and being treated as wife by the plaintiff during those years.
"" 108 832 Upon the evidence to which reference has been made, the trial court came.to the conclusion that Ram Piari was the legally married wife of the appellant.
The learned judges of the High Court however found the evidence of the 4 witnesses who claimed to have been present at the marriage of the plaintiff to be quite uncon vincing, and they pointed out that the case of the plaintiff being that his marriage had been performed with great pomp and show, it was surprising that the evidence relating to it should be confined to 4 persons one of whom appeared to be a hired witness ' and the other 3 were interested persons.
As to the evidence of the 4 persons who claim to have been present at the plaintiff 's marriage, we find ourselves in agreement with the view taken by the High Court.
The evidence of the other witnesses undoubtedly establishes the fact that for some years the plaintiff and Ram Piari lived together as husband and wife and were treated as such, that Paras Ram, brother of Ram Piari, addressed the plaintiff as jija (a common name for sister 's husband), and that the plaintiff acted as Paras Ram 's guardian when the latter was admitted to D.A.V. School and was described as his brother in law in some of the entries in the school register.
The learned Judges of the High Court considered that the evi dence of certain witnesses who deposed to some of the facts on which the lower court relied, did not strictly comply with the requirements of section 50 of the Indian Evidence Act,firstly because the witnesses had no special means of knowledge on the subject of relationship between the plain tiff and Ram Piari, and secondly because what section 50 made relevant was not mere opinion but opinion ""expressed by conduct"" of persons who as members of the family or other wise, had special means of knowledge.
It seems to us that the question as to how far the evidence of those particular witnesses is relevant under section 50 is academic, because it is well settled that continuous cohabitation for a number of years may raise the presumption of marriage.
In the present case, it seems clear that the plaintiff and Ram Piari 833 lived and were treated as husband and wife for a number of years, and, in the absence of any material pointing to the contrary conclusion a presumption might have been drawn that they were lawfully married.
But the presumption which may be drawn from long cohabitation is rebuttable, and if there are circumstances which weaken or destroy that presumption, the court cannot ignore them.
We agree with the learned Judges of the High Court that in the present case, such circumstances are not wanting, and their cumulative effect warrants the conclusion that the plaintiff has failed to prove the factum of his marriage with Ram Piari.
In the first place, the plaintiff has not examined any of his near relations such as his brother, or collaterals living in Ajnoha, or any co villagers, whose presence at the marriage would have been far more probable than the presence of the witnesses examined by him.
He has also not examined any of the witnesses residing in or round about Holta estate in spite of the fact that his own case is that the marriage was celebrated with great pomp and show.
was suggested in the courts below that since defendant No. 2 is an influen tial person, no local witnesses would be available to sup port the plaintiff 's case, but the High Court has very fully dealt with this aspect and pointed out firstly that Raj Kumari had litigation with a number of persons belonging to Palampur and such persons would not be under her influence, and secondly that no gold reason has been shown why Raj Kumari, who is alleged to have brought about the marriage between the plaintiff and Ram Hari, should take a completely hostile attitude towards him.
Then again, neither the parents nor any of the relations of Ram Piari have been examined to support the plaintiff.
On the other hand, Ram Hari 's own mother, Ganga, has deposed that the former was never married to the plaintiff, and the statement made by Ram Piari in her will, which is a very valuable piece of evidence, is to the same effect.
It is also in credible that in spite of the love which Ram Piari is said to have had for the plaintiff, she left him 834 and went away to live with Raj Kumari, and that during the long period when Ram Piari was away, the plaintiff should never have visited her or made enquiries about her and his alleged daughter, Parvin Kumari.
This is all the more strange, since it is stated by the plaintiff that Ram Piari continued to love him and that she and Raj Kumari inwardly hated each other.
Parvin Kumari says in her deposition that she had never seen her father and that when she reached the age of discretion she found herself living at Palampur.
The conduct of the plaintiff in showing such complete indiffer ence to his wife and daughter as is disclosed in his evi dence is most unnatural, and no less unnatural is his con duct in instituting a suit to deprive her of properties which had come into her hands not by reason of anything done by him but as a result of the generosity shown towards her by a stranger.
The plaintiff 's case that the properties in dispute were acquired by Ram Piari with the aid of his money is wholly untrue, and it has been rightly found by both the courts that they were acquired for her by Raj Kumari.
The plaintiff 's witnesses have tried to exaggerate his means to support his case, but the truth appears to be that he had hardly any means of his own beyond the somewhat meagre salary which he used to draw as a court typist.
Several of the witnesses including an Advocate and Ram Piari 's own mother have deposed that Ram Piari had eloped with a driver and had remained away from Holta estate for a number of years.
Even the Subordinate Judge has not reject ed the story of elopement, and though there is no reliable evidence as to when and how she met the plaintiff, the possibility of her having lived with him for some years even though they were not legally married, cannot be ruled out.
The plaintiff claims to be a Rajput of high caste, and it appears to us rather unusual that he should not marry in his own tribe but should take in marriage a Gurkha girl who was born of very poor parents and belonged to a place far away from where he himself lived.
835 The fact that Paras Ram lived with the plaintiff for some time and addressed the latter as jija, and that the plaintiff described himself as guardian and brother in law of Paras Ram, is as consistent with the defence version as with the plaintiff 'section If Paras Ram 's parents had been in affluent circumstances so as to be able to maintain and educate him, the case would have been different, but there is evidence to show that Chandar Bir was very poor and both his wife and daughter had to work as servants of Raj Kumari to earn their living.
In our opinion, the conclusion arrived at by the High Court has not been shown by the plaintiff to be incorrect, and whatever the true facts may be, we are compelled to hold that in the present state of evidence the plaintiff has not succeeded in establishing that Ram Piari was his legally wedded wife.
In the view we have taken, it is not necessary to deal with the question whether succession to the properties in dispute will be governed by customary law or by Hindu law, but since it was argued before us at very great length, we think that we might state the contentions of the parties and the difficulties which in our opinion arise in dealing with those contentions on the material before us.
Before doing so, however, we wish to set out briefly certain gener al principles which we think should be kept in view in dealing with questions of customary law.
They may be summa rized as follows : (1) It should be recognized that many of the agricul tural tribes in the Punjab are governed by a variety of customs, which depart from the ordinary rules of Hindu and Muhammadan law, in regard to inheritance and other matters mentioned in section 5 of ' the .
(2) In spite of the above fact, there is no presumption that a particular person or class of persons is governed by custom, and a party who is alleged to be governed by custom ary law must prove that he is so governed and must also prove the existence of the 836 custom set up by him.
See Daya Ram vs Sohel Singh and Others (1), Abdul Hussein Khan vs Bibi Song Dero C).
(3) A custom, in order to be binding, must derive its force from the fact that by long usage it has obtained the force of law, but the English rule that ""a custom, in order that it may be legal and binding, must have been used so long that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary"" should not be strictly applied to Indian conditions.
All that is necessary to prove is that the usage has been acted upon in practice for such a long period and with such invar iability as to show that it has, by common consent, been submitted to as the established governing rule of a particu lar locality.
See Mr. Subhani vs Nawab(3).
(4) A custom may be proved by general evidence as to its existence by members of the tribe or family who would natu rally be cognizant of its existence and its exercise without controversy, and such evidence may be safely acted on when it is supported by a public record of custom such as the Riwaj i am or Manual of Customary Law.
See Abroad Khan vs Mt. Channi Bibi(4).
(5) No statutory presumption attaches to the contents of a Riwaj i am or similar compilation, but being a public record prepared by a public officer in the discharge of his duties under Government rules, the statements to be found therein in support of custom are admissible to prove facts recited therein and will generally be regarded as a strong piece of evidence of the custom.
The entries in the Riwaj i am may however be proved to be incorrect, and the quantum of evidence required for the purpose of rebutting them will vary with the circumstances of each case.
The presumption of correctness attaching to a Riwaj i am may be rebutted, if it is shown that it affects adversely the rights of females or any other class of persons who had no opportunity of appearing before the revenue authorities.

(6) When the question of custom applicable to an agri culturist is raised, it is open *to a party who denies the application of custom to show that the person who claims to be governed by it has completely and permanently drifted away from agriculture and agricultural associations and settled for good in urban life and adopted trade, service, etc., as his principal occupation and means and source of livelihood, and does not follow other customs applicable to agriculturists.
See Muhammad Hayat Khan vs Sandhe Khan and Others(3), Muzaffar Muhammad vs Imam Din(4).
(7) The opinions expressed by the compiler of a Riwaj i am or Settlement Officer as a result of his intimate knowledge and investigation of the subject, are entitled to weight which will vary with the circumstances of each case.
The only safe rule to be laid down with regard to the weight to be attached to the compiler 's remarks is that if they represent his personal opinion or bias and detract from the record of long standing custom, they will not be sufficient to displace the custom, but if they are the result of his inquiry and investigation as to the scope of the applicabil ity of the custom and any special sense in which the expo nents of the custom expressed themselves in regard to it, such remarks should be given due weight.
See Narain Singh vs Mt. Basant Kaur(5), Mt. Chinto vs Thelur (6); Khedam Hussain vs Mohammad Hussain(7).
Bearing these principles in mind, the difficulty which appears to us to beset the case of the plaintiff may be briefly stated as follows : The basis of the plaintiff 's case is that the custom by which he claims to be governed is a ""zamindara custom"" and he is governed by it by reason of his belonging to a family of agriculturists.
From the evidence, however, it appears that he Had sold most, if not (1)A.I.R.1944 P.C.18.

838 all, of his property in the village to which he belonged, that his ancestors were bankers or sahukars, that his father was a clerk of a lawyer practising in Hoshiarpur district and that he himself was a clerk in the District Judge 's court at Hoshiarpur and lived there, and there is hardly any evidence to show that any of his relations was dependent on agriculture or that he maintained connection with them.
In our opinion.
the witnesses of the plaintiff have tried to grossly exaggerate his pecuniary means and have not given a correct picture on which the answer to the question as to whether he would still be governed by the old custom would depend.
Again, though according to the answer to question 11 in the Riwaj i am of Hoshiarpur district, the general custom governing the Rajputs of that district would seem to be that a marriage within the tribe only is lawful, the plaintiff did not marry a Rajput of his district but is said to have married a Gurkha woman, about whose caste and char acter the evidence is conflicting, and whose family was admittedly not governed by the ""Riwaj iam"" upon which the plaintiff relies.
If both the husband and the wife are shown to belong to the same tribe and to be governed by the same custom, then the difficulty in deciding what would be the rule of succession on the death of the wife in regard to the wife 's self acquired property may not be very great.
But even if it be assumed that Ram Piari was lawfully married to the plaintiff, the serious question to be decided would be whether succession to the property which Ram Piari received as gift from a stranger and which she owned in her own right, would be governed by the custom governing her hus band 's family and not her own.
Such marriage as is said to have been contracted by the plaintiff being evidently an event of rare occurrence, the rule of succession set up by him cannot be said to derive its force from long usage.
As we have pointed out, a custom in order to be binding must derive its force from the fact that by long usage it has obtained the force of law; and if an Occasion never arose to apply the rule of succession 839 invoked by the plaintiff, to the property held by a wife in her own right, the foundation on which custom grows would be wanting.
When the matter is further probed, it appears that the plaintiff relies not only on custom but partly on custom 'and partly on the rule of Hindu law, namely, that the law which governs the husband will govern the wife also.
Whether the latter rule can be extended to a case like the present is a question of some difficulty, on which, as at present advised, we would reserve our opinion.
In the cir cumstances.
we prefer to leave the issue of custom undecid ed.
and base our decision on the sole ground, which by itself is sufficient to conclude the appeal, that the plain tiff 's marriage with Ram Piari has not been clearly estab lished.
The appeal therefore fails and it is dismissed.
but in the circumstances of the case and particularly since the appellant has appealed in forma pauperis, we direct that the parties will bear their own costs in all the courts.
Appeal dismissed.
","The plaintiff, a Rajput belonging to Tehsil Garhshankar in the District of Hoshiarpur (Punjab), instituted a suit against the defendant for the recovery of the properties which belonged to a deceased Gurkha woman R and which she had acquired by way of gift from a stranger, alleging that he was the lawfully wedded husband of Rand that accord ing to custom which applied to the parties with regard to succession he was entitled to succeed to the moveable and immoveable properties of R in preference to the defendant who was his daughter by R. Held, that even if it be assumed that R was lawfully married to the plaintiff, the question to be decided would be whether succession to property which R had received as a gilt from a stranger and which she owned in her own right would be governed by the custom governing her husband 's family and not her own.
Such marriage as was alleged to have been contracted by the plaintiff being evidently an act of rare occurrence, the rule of succession set up by the plaintiff cannot be said to derive its force from long usage and the plaintiff was not, in any event, entitled to succeed.
Their Lordships laid down the general principles which should be kept in view in dealing with questions of custom ary law as follows: (1) It should be recognised that many of the agricultur al tribes in the Punjab are governed by a variety of cus toms, which depart from the ordinary rules of Hindu and Muhammadan law, in regard to inheritance and other matters mentioned in section 5 of the .

Appeal from a judgment of the Bombay High Court (Chagla C.J. and Dixit J.) in Appeal No. 281 of 1947.
K. section Krishnaswami Aiyangar (K. Narasimha Aiyangar, with him) for the appellant.
M.C. Setalvad, Attorney General for India, (B. Sen, with him) for the respondent.
December 1.
The Judgment of the court was deliv ered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
This appeal, preferred ch from the decree of the Bombay High Court in Appeal No. 281 of 1947, raises the question whether an execution application seeking to execute a final decree, passed by the let Class Subordinate Judge 's Court at Poona, on 6th December, 1932, for a sum of Rs. 1,24,215 and odd, is barred by limitation.
The decree was made in a suit for dissolution of a partner ship and the taking of accounts.
854 The execution application was filed on 4th October, 1946, and the amount stated to be due under the decree on that date was Rs. 2,30,986 and odd.
The previous execution application No 946 of 1940 filed in the Court of the 1st Class Sub Judge, Sholapur, to which the decree had been transferred for execution, was made on 24th June, 1940.
It was dismissed on 9th September, 1940, for non prosecution.
It would thus be seen that the present application was filed after the lapse of 12 years from the date of the final decree and 3 years from the date of the final order on the previous application.
To surmount the bar of limitation, the decree holder, who is the appellant before us, raised four contentions:firstly, that the final decree, which provided that the plaintiff should pay the deficit court fees on the decretal amount before the execution of the decree, was a conditional decree, and that time began to run from the date when the condition was fulfilled on 5th Decem ber, 1935, by payment; secondly, that the period occupied by the insolvency proceedings from 10th August, 1937, to 14th December, 1942, initiated by the decree holder to get the first judgment debtor Walchand Ramchand Kothari (with whom alone we are now concerned) adjudged an insolvent, should be excluded under section 14 (2) of the Limitation Act; third ly, that the period occupied by one Tendulkar, who was the creditor of the present decree holder, in seeking to execute this decree, should be deducted; and lastly, that as the judgment debtor prevented execution of the decree against the 'Prabhat ' newspaper by suppressing his ownership of the same, a fresh starting point of limitation springs up in the decree holder 's favour from the date of the discovery of the fraud.
The Subordinate Judge held that the execution applica tion was not barred, agreeing with every one of these con tentions.
On appeal to the High Court Chagla C.J. and Dixit J. reversed this decision, holding that it was not a condi tional decree, that the steps taken by Tendulkar to execute this decree were of no avail, and that the insolvency pro ceedings were for a 855 different relief altogether, so that section 14 (2) of the Limitation Act could not be invoked.
They concurred with the finding of the Subordinate Judge that the judgment debtor prevented the execution of the decree within 12 years by fraudulent concealment of his ownership of the 'Prabhat ' newspaper and that the twelve years ' bar of limi tation did not apply; but they held that the application was barred under article 182 of the Limitation Act, as more than three years had run from 9th September, 1940, the date of the dismissal of the previous execution application, before the present application was filed on 4th October, 1946.
Points 1 to 3 above mentioned are of no avail to the appel lant.
The decree was not a conditional one in the sense that some extraneous event was to happen on the fulfilment of which alone it could be executed.
The payment of court fees on the amount found due was entirely in the power of the decree holder and there was nothing to prevent him from paying it then and there; it was a decree capable of execu tion from the very date it was passed.
There could be no exclusion of the time occupied by the insolvency proceedings which clearly was not for the purpose of obtaining the same relief.
The relief sought in insolvency is obviously differ ent from the relief sought in the execution application.
In the former, an adjudication of the debtor as insolvent is sought as preliminary to the vesting of all his estate and the administration of it by the Official Receiver or the Official Assignee, as the case may be, for the benefit of all the creditors; but in the latter, the money due is sought to be realized for the benefit of the decree holder alone, by processes like attachment of property and arrest of person.
It may be that ultimately in the insolvency proceedings the decreeholder may be able to realize his debt wholly or in part, but this is a mere consequence or result.
Not only is the relief of a different nature in the two proceedings but the procedure is also widely divergent.
The steps taken by the appellant 's creditor Tendulkar to attach this decree and put it in execution do not save limitation.
His darkhast for attachment of the 856 present decree was on 3rd April, 1940, and for execution of the present decree was on 1st February, 1944, more than 3 years from 9th September, 1940, which is the date of the dismissal of the appellant 's prior execution petition.
The learned Advocate for the appellant therefore devot ed most of his argument to the fourth contention set forth above.
That the judgment debtor respondent suppressed his ownership of the 'Prabhat ' newspaper and fraudulently pre vented the execution of the decree against this property has been found by both the Courts below, as stated already.
It was strenuously urged that the fraud so found is not merely fraud as broadly interpreted under section 48 (2), Civil Procedure Code, but also strict or concealed fraud within the meaning of section 18 of the Limitation Act.
In this connection, it is as well to set out very briefly the nature of the concealment and the steps taken by the judgment debtor to achieve the same.
He purchased the 'Prabhat ' newspaper with all its assets and goodwill from its previ ous owner one Purushottam Mahadev in 1938 under the letter marked Exhibit 129.
He opened current accounts in several banks, and gave the name of one Abhyankar as the owner of the paper, but he was himself operating on those accounts.
One Rajwade, a friend of the judgment debtor, was shown as the printer and publisher of the paper.
Even in his supplementary written statement flied in Court in answer to the present execution, marked Exhibit 88 (page 53 of the printed book), the defendant asserted in paragraph 2 that he became the owner of the newspaper only in April,/944, and that previously he had no ownership or right in the same.
He did not go into the witness box to refute the allegation that he was the owner ever since the purchase of the paper in 1938 and that he opened accounts in the names of other people on which he was operating for his own benefit.
On these facts, the Subordinate Judge found as follows : ""I think on the whole that the evidence establish es beyond doubt that the judgment debtor had concealed his proprietary interest in his newspaper called 857 Prabhat ' from June, 1938, to April, 1944.
The only purpose for which the property could have been concealed in this way was probably the fear that the decree holder would pounce upon it if he came to know about it.
The decree holder came to know of this fraud after April, 1944; for thereafter the judgment debtor made an open declaration that the newspaper belonged to him.
I think therefore that this fraud has prevented the decree holder from executing the decree against some property of the judgment debtor.
"" In this finding, the High Court concurred.
After referring to the stratagem adopted by the judgment debtor in Bhagu Jetha vs Malick Bawasaheb(1), the learned Judges observed: ""In this case, in our opinion, the stratagem is much more dishonest.
The attempt on the part of the judgment debtor was to conceal his property, to deny its ownership and to put forward a mere benamidar as the real owner of that property.
In our opinion, therefore, the execution of the decree is not barred under section 48.
The 'judgment debtor has, by fraud, prevented the execution of the decree within 12 years before the date of the application for execution by the decree holder and therefore the decree under consideration is capable of being executed.
"" On the strength of this concurrent finding, Mr. Krish naswami Iyengar for the appellant argued that the fraud fell within the scope of section 18 of the Limitation Act and that if it were so, he was out of the woods, inasmuch as the proper article to apply would be article 181 of the/imita tion Act.
The right to apply accrued to him when the fraud became known to him in or about June, 1946. 'Till then he was kept by the fraud from the knowledge of his right to make an application against the property.
Law does not require him to make futile successive applications in execu tion, in the face of this fraud.
He was not in a position to seek even the arrest of the judgment debtor as he had got himself declared in the insolvency proceedings as agriclu turist."" within the meaning of the Deccan (1) I.L.R. 110 858 Agriculturists ' Relief Act.
alleging falsely that he was not in receipt of any income by way of salary or remuneration from the newspaper concerned and that he was mainly depend ent on the income of his family lands for his maintenance.
There can be no question that the conduct of the re spondent was fraudulent within the meaning of section 48 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.
Though benami transactions are common in this country and there is nothing per se wrong in a judgment debtor purchasing property in another man 's name, we have to take into account all the circumstances attending the purchase and his subsequent conduct for find ing out whether it was part of a fraudulent scheme on his part to prevent the judgment creditor from realizing the fruits of his decree.
Fraudulent motive or design is not capable of direct proof in most cases; it can only be in ferred.
The facts before us here leave no room for doubt that the true object of the judgmentdebtor was to prevent the execution of the decree against the ' Prabhat ' news paper Which he had purchased.
Other persons were shown as the printer and the publisher of the newspaper, while Abhy ankar was mentioned as the proprietor, The judgement debtor, was, however, operating on those accounts for his own benefit.
In the Insolvency Court, he set up the plea that he was an agriculturist, by suppressing the truth about his ownership of the paper, and pretending that his income was mainly, if not solely, from the family lands.
He kept up this show till April 1944, when probably he felt that he was sale from the reach of the judgment creditor.
Even in his answer to the execution application, out of which this appeal has arisen, he had the hardihood to assert that he was not the owner of the paper till April 1944.
It should also be remembered that he did not get into the witness box to explain what other necessity there was for all this camouflage, except it be to cheat the appellant of his dues under the decree.
Mr. Setalvad, the learned Attorney General, who appeared for the respondent, pointed out that there 859 was no benami purchase and that the holding out of Abhyankar as the proprietor of the ' Prabhat ' did not amount to any false representation or misrepresentation to the judgment creditor, as the accounts on which reliance was placed were accounts opened in the banks and were not ordinarily avail able for inspection by third parties.
This line of reasoning is hardly convincing, when we have to consider whether what is attributed to the judgment debtor does not amount to a fraudulent scheme or device for preventing execution of the decree that had been passed against him for a very large sum of money.
In the very nature of things, fraud is secret in its origin or inception and in the means adopted for its success.
Each circumstance by itself may not mean much, but taking all of them together, they may reveal a fraudulent or dishonest plan.
It would be convenient to set out here in extenso sec tion 48, Civil Procedure Code, and section 18 of the Limita tion Act before we proceed to consider the soundness of the arguments advanced by both sides in support of the positions they have taken up.
Section 48, Civil Procedure Code (which corresponds to section 230 of the Code of 1882), is in these terms: "" 48.
(1) Where an application to execute a decree not being a decree granting an injunction has been made, no order for the execution of the same decree shall be made upon any fresh application presented after the expiration of 12 years from (a) the date of the decree sought to be executed, or (b) where the decree or any subsequent order directs, any payment of money or the delivery of any property to be made at a certain date or at recurring periods the date of the default in making the payment of delivery in respect of which the applicant seeks to execute the decree.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be deemed (a) to preclude the Court from ordering the executior of a decree upon an application presented after the expiration of the said term of twelve years, where the 860 judgment debtor has by fraud or force prevented the execu tion of the decree at some time within twelve years immedi ately before the date of the application; or (b) to limit or otherwise affect the operation of arti cle 183 of the first Schedule to the Indian Limitation Act, 1908.
"" Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1908, runs thus: "" 18.
Where any person having a right to institute a suit or make an application has, by means of fraud, been kept from the knowledge of such right or of the title on which it is founded, or where any document necessary to establish such right has been fraudulently concealed from him, the time limited for instituting a suit or making an application (a) against the person guilty of the fraud or accessory thereto, or (b) against any person claiming through him other wise than in good faith and for a valuable consideration, shall be computed from the time when the fraud first became known to the person injuriously affected thereby, or, in the case of the concealed document, when he first had the means of producing it or compelling its production."" Whether the fraud of the judgment debtor should actually prevent the execution of the decree or whether it is enough if the fraud has been committed without esulting in actual prevention is a question on which there has been some diver gence of opinion in the decided cases.
The former view was taken in an early Madras case Kannu Pillay vs Chellathammal and ) Others(1) and receives support from the decision reported in Sri Raja Venkata Lingama Nayanim Bahadur Varu and Another vs Raja Inuganti Rajaopala Venkata Narasimha Rayanim Bahadur Varu and five Others(2)to which our learned brother Mr. Justice Patanjali Sastri was a party.
The latter view ( (1) [1898] M.I.J. Mad.
861 is indicated in M.R.M.A.S.P. Ramathan Chefliar vs Mahalingam Chetti(1) by a Bench of which Sir Madhavan Nair J. was a member.
It is not necessary to determine which view is correct, as we have here definite findings of both the Courts below that there was fraud preventing the execution of the decree within the meaning of Section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code.
The appellant thus escapes the bar of the 12 years ' period and he has a fresh starting point of limitation from the date of the fraud for section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code.
In other words, the decree holder has another 12 years within which he can execute his decree.
Having thus got over the difficulty in his way under section 48 of the Code of Civil Procedure, he has next to meet the objection under the Limitation Act.
On behalf of the appellant, it was urged that section 18 of the Limita tion Act applied to the facts and that the right to apply accrued to the appellant when the fraud by the judgment debtor became known to him in 1946.
No reliance was placed on section 18 of the Limitation Act in the courts below and no reference to it is found in the grounds of appeal to this court.
It is however mentioned for the first time in the appellant 's statement of the case.
If the facts proved and found as established are sufficient to make out a case of fraud within the meaning of section 18, this objection may not be serious, as the question of the applicability of the section will be only a question of law and such a question could be raised at any stage of the case and also in the final court of appeal.
The following obser vations of Lord Watson in Connecticut Fire Insurance Co. vs Kavanagh (2) are relevant.
He said: ""When a ques tion of law is raised for the first time in a court of last resort upon the construction of a document or upon facts either admitted or proved beyond controversy, it is not only competent but expedient in the interests of justice to entertain the plea.
The expediency of (1) 1.L.R. (2) 862 adopting that course may be doubted when the plea cannot be disposed of without deciding nice questions of fact in considering which the court of ultimate review is placed in a much less advantageous position than the courts below."" Mr. Setalvad, however, urged that the appellant should not be allowed to rely on section 18 now for the first time and that even if fraud within the meaning of that section had been pleaded the respondent might have adduced counter evidence by himself going into the witness box or otherwise.
According to him, the approach to the question of fraud under section 18 of the Limitation Act is quite different from the approach under section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code.
There may be cases where the fraud alleged and found is fraud in the wider sense of the term within the meaning of section 48 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code, but the same facts do not amount to fraud as strictly construed under section 18 of the Limitation Act.
The fact that the decree holder in the lower courts relied on section 48, Civil Procedure Code, only does not prevent him from relying on section 18 of the Limitation Act if the facts necessary to be established for bringing in the assistance of section 18 of the Limitation Act are admitted, or proved.
It is not disputed that the fraud contemplated by section 18 of the Limitation Act is of a different type from the fraud contem plated by section 48 (2) of the Civil Procedure Code.
The wording of section 18 which requires the fraud ""to prevent knowledge of the right to make the application"" is neces sarily of a different nature from the fraud which prevents the decree holder from making an application for execution.
Conceding to the appellant the right to rely on section 18 of the Limitation Act even at this late stage, let us see if it is really of any help to him on the facts found.
The section has been quoted already.
It speaks of the right to institute a suit or make an application which by means of fraud has been kept from the knowledge of the person having the right or the title on which it is founded.
The right to apply for 863 execution of a decree like the one before us is a single and indivisible right, and not a composite right consisting of different smaller rights and based on the decree holder 's remedies to proceed against the person of the judgment debtor or his properties, moveable and immoveable.
Togive such a meaning would be to split up the single right into parcels and to enable the decree holder to contend that while his right to proceed against a particular item of property is barred, it is not barred in respect of other items.
We would then be face to face with different periods of limitation as regards one and the same decree.
An inter pretation which leads to this result is prima facie un sound.
Both sides agreed that this is the true position, but they reached it from slightly varying standpoints.
According to the appellant, fraud even with reference to one property gives him a further extension of 12 years under section 48 (2) as regards the whole decree and it is not necessary for him to show that he had proceeded against the other properties of the judgment debtor.
According to the respondent, the fraud must consist in the concealment of the knowledge of the decree holder 's right to apply for execution of the decree and it is not enough to prove or establish that the fraud prevented him from ' proceeding against a specific item.
The two contentions, lead to the same conclusion about the indivisibility of the decree, but along different lines.
In our opinion, the facts necessary to establish fraud under section 18 of the Limitation Act are neither admitted nor proved in the present case.
Concealing from a person the knowledge of his right to apply for execution of a decree is undoubtedly different from preventing him from exercising his right, of which he has knowledge.
Section 18 of the Limitation Act postulates the former alternative.
To read it as referring to an application for execution to proceed against a particular property would be destructive of the oneness of the decree and would lead to multiplicity of periods of limitation.
It is true that articles 181 and 182 of the Limitation Act and section 48, 864 Civil Procedure Code, should be read together.
The articles expressly refer to the section.
But they are independent or parallel provisions, different in their scope and object.
As held in Kalyanasundaram Pillai vs Vaithilinga Vanniar (1) section 48 (2) extends the 12 years ' period of closure by a further period of similar duration but the necessity of resort to article 182 is not thereby obviated.
The decree holder must have been taking steps to keep the decree alive and the only circumstance that could relieve him of this obligation is the existence of fraud under section 18 of the Limitation Act.
The learned Advocate of the appellant asked how it could be possible for him to apply in execution when there was the fraud and whether the law contemplated that, even though the fraud prevented execution of the decree, he was to go on filing useless or futile applications every three years merely for keeping the decree alive.
The answer is simple.
The fraud pleaded namely suppression of owner ship of the 'Prabhat ' newspaper, did not conceal from him his right to make an application for execution of the de cree.
Indeed, the suppression, which began in 1938, did not prevent the decree holder from applying for execution in 19 10; and in his answers in cross examination, he has adimitted that there were other properties to his knowledge against which he could have sought execution, viz., deposits in several banks of the judgment debtor 's monies but stand ing in his wife 's or daughter 's names, life insurance poli cies for which premia were being paid by him, law books written and published by him, movable properties in the house at Poona etc.
As a matter of fact, the appellant 's present application seeks execution against several of these properties.
Nothing prevented him therefore ,from seeking such execution within 3 years of the dismissal of his prior application in 1940.
Even with reference to the 'Prabhat ', all that the decree holder states is that as he had no evidence to prove that the concern belonged to the defendant he did not take any steps, and not that he had no (1) I,L.R. 1939 Mad.611 865 knowledge of the ownership.
To quote two sentences from his deposition: ""I had suspected that defendant No. 1 was the real owner of the business all the while.
But I had no posi tive knowledge or information till 1946"" . . ""I could not take any step for attaching the defendant 's business till 1946 as I had no evidence to prove the defendant 's fraud till then.
"" There is no obligation on the judgment debtor to post the decree holder with all details of his properties; it is the decree holder 's business to gather knowledge about the properties so that he can realise the fruits of his decree.
In dealing with this evidence, Mr. Krishnaswami lyengar relied on the Privy Council decision, Rahimbhoy vs Turner in 20 I.A. 1 and referred to the following observation of Lord Hobhouse at page ""But their Lordships consider, and in this they agree with both the Courts below, that all that the appellant Rahimbhoy has done is to show that some clues and hints reached the assignee in the year 1881, which perhaps, if vigorously and acutely followed up, might have led to a complete knowledge of the fraud, but that there was no disclosure made which informed the mind of the assignee that the insolvent 's estate had been defrauded by Rahimbhoy of these assets in the year 1867.
"" The passage cited does not apply here because the appellant admits knowledge, which is more than a mere suspicion, but states that he had no evidence to prove the defendant 's ownership.
In any event, it has not been established within the meaning of section 18 of the Limitation Act that the fraud alleged and proved kept back from him the knowledge of his right to execute the decree.
It is thus clear that the appellant cannot get the benefit of section 18 of the Limitation Act.
It was next argued on behalf of the appellant that under section 48(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, because of the fraud of the respondent the appellant got a fresh starting point of limitation for the Limitation Act also 111 866 and therefore the starting point contemplated in the third column of the schedule to the Limitation Act relating to applications for execution should be the date when the fraud was discovered by the appellant.
In other words, it was argued that the effect of section 48 was not merely to make the 12 years ' period start from the discovery of fraud for the purpose of section 48(2) of the Civil Procedure Code but also to give a fresh starting point for the schedule to the Limitation Act.
This argument cannot be accepted.
If a man is prevented from making an application, because of the fraud of the debtor, he is not necessarily prevented from knowing his right to make the application.
By the enactment of section 18, the Legislature has distinctly contemplated that for the Limitation Act the starting point is changed on the ground of fraud, only when the knowledge of the right to make the application is prevented by the fraud of the judg mentdebtor.
Having the knowledge that he had the right to make the application, if the judgment debtor prevents the decree holder from knowing the existence of certain properties against which the decree could be enforced, the case is clearly not covered by the words of section 18 of the Limitation Act.
Therefore the argument advanced on behalf of the appellant is unsound.
It was urged that the various starting points mentioned in the third column to article 182 of the Limitation Act cannot apply because none of them specify a fresh starting point for execution acquired on the ground of the fraud of the judgment debtor.
This argument, in our opinion, instead of helping the appellant, goes against him.
Such a provision in the third column in the article relating to execution of decrees is not necessary because provision for such a con tingency is made in section 18.
Affirmatively, by the inclu sion of section 18 in the Limitation Act, and, negatively, by not providing for a separate period of limitation in the case of the fraud of the judgment debtor in the third column in the articles, the Legislature has clearly indicated that unless advantage could be taken by the 867 decree holder under section 18 on the ground of the fraud of the judgment debtor, fraud does not give any other relief under the Limitation Act.
This scheme of the Legislature is not inconsistent with section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code.
The two provisions in the two Acts have to be read as related to the same subject but dealing with two differents aspects.
Without section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code a decree holder, if he made applications as required by arti cle 181 or 182 of the Limitation Act, could keep his decree alive for an indefinite period.
The Legislature, as a matter of policy, ruled that a decree of a civil court (but excluding the High Court) shall not be kept alive for more than 12 years, although all necessary steps are taken under the Limitation Act to keep the decree alive and operative.
That is one limit to the right of the decree holder to enforce the decree of the court.
The second limitation to his right, which is independent of the first, is that he must keep the decree alive under article 182 or 181, as the case may be.
In the case of the fraud of the judgment debtor provision is made in section 48(2) for enlarging the 12 years period prescribed under section 48.
For defeating the plea of the bar of limitation under the Limitation Act, in the case of fraud of the judgment debtor, provision is found in section 18 of the Limitation Act.
If the particu lar case of fraud set up and proved is not covered by those words, there is no protection against the same in the Limi tation Act.
Read in that way, the two legislative provi sions are neither conflicting nor overlapping; and they are capable of operating harmoniously, as they deal with different situations and circumstances.
The argument ad vanced on behalf of the appellant that because of the fraud he got not merely a fresh starting point for computing the 12 years period prescribed in section 48 ( '2,) of the Civil Procedure Code but is also entitled to an extension of the time under the Limitation Act, must therefore fail.
The second contention urged on behalf of the appellant that because in the third column of article 182 868 fraud is not mentioned, the case is covered by article 181 does not also appear to be sound.
The third column in article 182 prescribes the starting point of limitation under different specified circumstances.
It does not, and indeed need not, mention the ground of fraud because if fraud of the kind against which the Limitation Act contem plates relief, as prescribed in section 18 of the Limitation Act, is established, the time is automatically altered by operation of that section.
If the case does not fall under that section, no relief is permitted under the Limitation Act and the starting point for computing the period must be as mentioned in the third column, irrespective of the question of fraud.
In our opinion, therefore, the conten tion that because of the fraud established in the present case under section 48(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, the appellant gets a fresh starting point of limitation under article 182 of the Limitation Act is unacceptable.
The appellant relied on the general principle of juris prudence that fraud stops or suspends the running of time and that it should be applied in his favour, apart from section 18 of the Limitation Act.
Rules of equity have no application.
where there are definite statutory provisions specifying the grounds on the basis of which alone the stoppage or suspension of running of time can arise.
While the courts necessarily are astute in checkmating or fighting fraud, it should be equally borne in mind that statutes of limitation are statutes of repose.
For the reasons given above we concur in the conclusion reached by the High Court and dismiss the appeal with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
","An application for execution of a decree was made after the expiry of 12 'years from the date of the decree and 3 years from the date of the final order on the last previous application for execution.
The decree holder contended that the judgment debtor had ""fraudulently purchased a business in the name of a stranger and had conducted the same in the name of the latter with a view to prevent the assets of the business from being proceeded against in execution by the decree holder and that therefore under section 48 of the Civil Procedure Code he was entitled to make an application even after the expiry of 19, years.
The High Court found that, as the decree holder was prevented by the fraud of the judgment debtor from executing the decree, the application was not barred under section 48 of the Code, but as it was made more than 3 years from the date of the order on the last application it was barred under article 182 of the Limitation Act.
The decree holder appealed contending for the first time before the Supreme Court as fraud for the purpose of section 48 of Civil Procedure Code was proved, section 18 of the Limita tion Act was applicable to the case and his application was not barred under article 189.
as it was made within three years of the date when he became aware of the fraud and the proper article applicable was article 181: Held, (i) that the question whether on the proved facts section 18 was applicable to the case was a pure question of law and the decree holder was entitled to raise the question before the Supreme Court, even though he had not raised it before the lower courts; (ii) though section 48, Civil Procedure Code, and articles 181 and 189.
of the Limitation Act dealt with the time limit for making applications for execution of decrees and should be read together, they were different in their scope and object, and the fact that the application was not barred under section 48, Civil Procedure Code, did not obviate the necessity of considering whether it was barred 853 under article 182; (iii) that, as the fraud committed by the judgment debtor did not in any way conceal from the decree holder the knowledge of his right to make an application for execution of , the decree but only prevented him from exer cising that right in respect of a particular property, section 18 had no application to the case, and the application was therefore barred under article 182 of the Limitation Act; (iv) the fact that there was no provision in article 182 for cases where the judgment debtor had committed a fraud as in the present case did not render that article inapplicable and bring the case within the purview of article 181 as article 182 has to be read with the general provisions contained in s.18 relating to eases where there is fraud.
Held also, (i) A decree which provides that the plain tiff should pay the deficient court fees before executing the decree is not a conditional decree and time for making an application for execution of such a decree runs from the date of the decree, and not from the date on which the plaintiff pays the deficit court fees.
(ii) The period of time during which the decree holder was prosecuting proceedings for adjudging the judgment debtor an insolvent cannot be excluded under 6.14 (2) of Limitation Act, in computing the period of limitation for making an application for executing the decree.

May 21.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
This Court granted special leave to appeal in this case on the Government agreeing to pay the costs of the respondents in respect of the appeal in any event.
The decree holder was a lady named Hira Devi.
The judg ment debtor was one Ram Grahit Singh, who retired on 31st January, ""1 '947, as a Head Clerk in the Dead Letter Office, Calcutta.
A money decree was obtained against him on 30th July, 1948.
On 1st February, 1949, a receiver was appointed for collecting the moneys standing to the credit of the judgment debtor in a Provident Fund with the Postal authori ties.
The Union of India intervened with an application dated 20th September, 1949, for setting aside the order appointing the receiver.
Mr. Justice Banerjee dismissed the application of the Union of India, holding that a receiver could be appointed for collecting the Fund.
On appeal, Trevor Harries C.J. and Sinha J. upheld his view.
From the facts stated in the petition filed by the Union of India before the High Court, it appears that a sum of Rs. 1,394 13 1 represents arrears of pay and allowances .due to the judgment debtor and a sum Of Rs. 1,563, is the compulso ry deposit in his Provident Fund account.
Different consid erations will apply to the two sums, though in the lower court the parties seem to have proceeded on the footing that the entire sum was a ""compulsory deposit"" within the meaning of the provident Funds Act, 1925.
The main question to be decided.
is whether a receiver can be appointed in execution in respect of provident Fund money due to the judgment debtor.
767 Compulsory deposit and other sums in or derived from any fund to which the Provident Funds Act XIX of 1925 applies are exempt from attachment and sale under section 60 (k), Civil Procedure Code.
""Compulsory deposit"" is thus defined in section 2 (a) of the Provident Funds Act XIX of 1925: Compulsory deposit means a subscription to, or deposit in a Provident Fund which under the rules of the Fund, is not, until the happening of some specified contingency repayable on demand otherwise than for the purpose of the payment of premia in respect of a policy of life insurance (or the Payment Of subscriptions or premia in respect of a family pension fund), and includes any contribution and any interest or increment which has accrued under the rules of the fund on any such subscription, deposit, contribution, and also any such subscription, deposit, contribution, interest or increment remaining to the credit of the sub scriber or depositor after the happening of any such contin gency.
"" Such a deposit cannot be assigned or charged and is not liable to any attachment.
Section 3 (1)of the said Act provides : 3.
(1)"" A compulsory deposit in any Government or Rail way Provident Fund shall not in any way be capable of being assigned or charged and shall not be liable to attachment under any decree or order of any Civil, Revenue or Criminal Court in respect of any debt or liability incurred by the subscriber or depositor, and neither the Official Assignee nor any receiver appointed under the shall be entitled to, or have any claim on any such compulsory deposit.
"" It is obvious that the prohibition against the assign ment or the attachment of such compulsory deposits is based on grounds of public policy.
Where the interdiction is absolute, to allow a judgment creditor to get at the fund indirectly by means of the appointment of a receiver would be to circumvent the statute.
That such a frustration of the very object of 768 the legislation should not be permitted was laid down by the Court of Appeal as early as 1886 in the case of Lucas vs Harris (1), where the question arose with reference to a pension payable to two officers of Her Majesty 's Indian Army.
Section 141 of the Army Act, 1881 provided: ""Every assignment of, and every charge on, and every agreement to assign or charge any . . pension pay able to any officer or soldier of Her Majesty 's forces, or any pension payable to any such officer . . or to any person in respect of any military service, shall except so far as the same is made in pursuance of a royal warrant for the benefit of the family of the person entitled thereto, or as may be authorised by any Act lot the time being in force, be void.
In that case, the appointment of a receiver to collect the pension was in question.
Lindley, L.J., observed: In considering whether a receiver of a retired officer 's pension ought to be appointed, not only the language but the object of section 141 of the Army Act.
1881 must be looked to; and the object of the section would, in my opinion, be defeated, and not advanced, if a receiver were appointed."" Lord Justice Lopes reiterated the same thing in these words : ""It is beyond dispute that the object of the legislature was to secure for officers who had served their country, a provision which would keep them from want and would enable them to retain a respectable social position.
i do not see how this object could be effected unless those pensions were made absolutely inalienable.
preventing not only the person himself assigning his interest in the pension.
but also preventing the pension being seized or attached under a garnishee order, or by an execution or other process of law.
Unless protection is given to this extent the object which the legislature had in view is frustrated, and a strange anomaly would exist.
A person with a (1) 18 (Q.B D. 127.
769 pension would not be able to utilise his pension to pay a debt beforehand, but immediately his creditor had obtained judgment might be deprived of his pension by attachment, equitable execution, or some other legal process.
It is impossible to suppose that the legislature could have in tended such an anomaly.
"" Section 51 of the Civil Procedure Code no doubt recognises five modes of execution of a decree and one of them is the appointment of a receiver.
Instead of executing the decree by attachment and sale, the Court may appoint a receiver but this can only be in a case where a receiver can be appointed.
The Provident Fund money is exempt from at tachment and is inalienable.
Normally, no execution can lie against such a sum.
The learned Judges in the Court below rested their view on the authority of the decision of the Privy Council in Rajindra Narain Singh vs Sundara Bibi(1).
This decision has caused all the difficulty and has created a current of thought that even though the property may not itself be liable to attachment, a receiver can be appointed to take possession of the same and to apply the income or proceeds in a particular manner including the payment of the debts of the judgment debtor.
It is necessary.
therefore, to examine the facts of the case carefully and find out whether the proposition sought to be deduced from it can be justified as a principle of general application apart from the particular circumstances.
The original decision of the Allahabad High Court from which the appeal was taken before the Judicial Committee is reported in Sundar Bibi vs Raj Indranarain Singh(2).
In a suit between two brothers, there was a com promise to the effect that the Judgment debtor shall possess and enjoy the immoveable properties mentioned in the list and estimated to yield a net profit of Rs. 8,000 a year without power of transfer during the lifetime of his broth er, Lal Bahadur Singh, he undertaking to pay certain public exactions and other dues (1)1925) 52 I.A. 262.
(2) (1921)43 All.
617 770 to his brother, Lal Bahadur Singh, amounting in all to Rs. 7,870 11 6, in four equal instalments per annum, each to be paid a month before the Government revenue falls due.
The arrangement was stated to be ""in lieu of his mainte nance"".
When the judgment debtor 's interest in the proper ties was sought to be attached and sold, he raised the objection that they were exempt from attachment and sale by reason of clause (n) of Section 60 of the Code which speaks of ""a right to future maintenance"".
The High Court held that the words employed in sub clause (n) contemplated R bare right of maintenance and nothing more a right enforce able by law and payable in the future and that inasmuch as in the case before them the properties had been assigned to the judgment debtor in lieu of his maintenance, it was not such a right, which alone was exempt from attachment and sate.
They thought that it was a fit case for the appoint ment of a receiver and remitted the execution petition to the subordinate judge for the appointment of a receiver after determining the allowance payable to the judgment debtor for his maintenance.
With this conclusion of the High Court the Judicial Committee concurred.
But they also expressed the view that they did not agree with the High Court on the subject of the actual legal position of the right of maintenance conferred upon the judgment debtor.
Taking the prayer of the judgment creditor to be that the right of maintenance be proceeded against, their Lordships observed that the right was in point of law not attachable and not saleable.
If it was an assignment of properties for maintenance, the amount of which was not fixed, it was open to the judgment creditor to get a receiver appointed subject to the condition that whatever may remain after making provision for the maintenance of the judgment debtor should be made available for the satisfaction of the decree debt.
The right to main tenance could not be attached or sold.
In so far as the decree holder sought to attach this right and deprive the judgment debtor of, his maintenance, he was not entitled to do 771 so, but where his application for the appointment of a receiver was more comprehensive and sought to get at any remaining income after satisfying the maintenance claim, the appointment of a receiver for the purpose was justified.
The decision of the Privy Council does not appear to lay down anything beyond this.
In our opinion, it is not an authority for the general proposition that even though there is a statutory prohibition against attachment and alienation of a particular species of property, it can be reached by another mode of execution, viz., the appointment of a re ceiver.
On the other hand, it was pointed out in the case of Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad vs Karnani Industrial Bank Limited(1) that as the Nawab had a disposing power over the rents and profits assigned to him for the maintenance of his title and dignity without any power of alienation of the properties, no question of public policy arose and that a receiver of the rents and profits was rightly appointed.
This line of reasoning indicates clearly that in cases where there is no disposing power and the statute imposes an absolute bar on alienation or attachment on grounds of public policy, execution should not be levied.
Understood as mentioned above, Rajindra Narain Singh 's case creates no difficulty.
We shall now refer to the decisions that followed or distinguished the same.
In The Secretary of State for India in Council vs Bai Somi and Another(2), the maintenance of Rs. 96 per annum was made under a compromise decree a charge on the house which was to belong to the defendant. 'the court fee due to Government was sought to be recovered by attachment of the house.
The right to attach was negatived; the house could not be at tached as it belonged to the defendant; and the plaintiff 's right to maintenance could not be attached under section 60, clause (1).
In dealing with a prayer made by the Govern ment for the first time in the High Court for an order appointing a receiver of the plaintiff 's maintenance, Beaumont C.J. and (1) (1931) 58 I.A. 215.
(2) 100 772 another learned Judge held that even this could not be done.
The Chief Justice said , 'If these exempted payments can be reached in execution by the appointment of a receiver by way of equitable execution, the protection afforded by the section is to a great extent lost."" They steered clear of Rajindra Narain Singh 's case by stating that there was in the judgment of the Board no clear expression of opinion and there was doubt whether the allowance then in question was maintenance or not.
The Madras High Court in The Secre tary of State for India in Council vs Sarvepalli Venkata Lakshmamma(1) has dealt with a question similar to the one in The Secretary of State for India in Council vs Bai Somi and Another(2) but it merely referred to the ruling in Rajindra Narain Singh 's case without dealing with the facts or the reasoning.
It throws no light.
The case in Janaki nath vs Pramatha Nath (3) was a decision by a single Judge and stands on the same footing as the Madras case.
There is nothing else on this subject in the judgment than the short observation, ""the Provident Funds Act does not in my opinion prohibit the appointment of a receiver of the sum lying to the credit of the deceased in the Provident Fund.
"" Possibly the view was taken that on the death of the employee and in the absence of any dependent or nominee becoming entitled to the fund under the rules, it became money payable to the heirs of the deceased and lost its original nature of being a compulsory deposit.
The case of Dominion of India, repre senting E. 1.
Administration and Another vs Ashutosh Das and Others(4) refers no doubt to Rajindra Narain Singh 's case but does not discuss it in any detail.
Roxburgh J. merely states ""surely it is an improper use of that equita ble remedy to employ it to avoid a very definite bar created by statute law to achieving the very object for which the receiver is appointed.
"" The decision in Ramprasad vs Moti ram(5) related to the attachment and sale in execution of a (1) (4) (2) (5) (1946) 25 Pat. 705.
(3) 773 money decree of the interest of a khoposhdar in a khorposh grant which was heritable and transferable.
It affords us no assistance.
The learned counsel for the respondents relied on three decisions of the Privy Council as lending him support.
One is Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad 's case(1) already referred to.
Vibhudapriya Thirtha Swamiar vs Lakshmindra Thirtha Swamiar(2) and Niladri Sahu vs Mahant Chaturbhuj Das and Others(3) are the other two eases and they relate to maths and alienations by way of mortgage of endowed properties by the respective mahants for alleged necessity of the institu tions.
They bear no analogy to the present ease.
The mahants had a beneficial interest in the properties after being provided with maintenance.
A receiver could be ap pointed in respect of such beneficial interest so that the decrees obtained may be satisfied.
With great respect to the learned Judges of the Court below, we are of the opinion that execution cannot be sought against the Provident Fund money by way of appointment of a receiver.
This conclusion does not, however, apply to the arrears of salary and allowance due to the judgment debtor as they stand upon a different legal footing.
Salary is not attach able to the extent provided in Section 60, clause (1), Civil Procedure Code, but there is no such exemption as regards arrears of salary.
The learned Attorney General conceded that this portion of the amount can be proceeded against in execution.
The Provident Fund amount was not paid to the subscriber after the date of his retirement in January 1947.
This, however, does not make it any the less a compulsory deposit within the meaning of the Act.
Whatever doubt may have existed under the earlier Act of 1897 the decisions cited for the respondent, Miller vs B.B. & C.I. Railway(4) and Raj (1) (1931) 58 I.A. 215.
(3) (1926) 53 I.A. 253.
(2) (1927) 54 I.A. 228.
(4) 774 Kumar Mukharjee vs W.G. Godfrey(1) are under that Act, the meaning has now been made clear by the definition in section 2 of the present Act; any deposit ""remaining to the credit of the subscriber or depositor after the happening of any such contingency"" is also a compulsory deposit; and the contingency may be retirement from service.
In the result, the appeal is allowed and the order of the lower court dated 1st February, 1949, appointing a receiver is set aside as regards the Provident Fund amount of Rs. 1,563 lying to the credit of the judgment debtor.
Under the condition granting special leave, the Government will pay the 1st respondent 's costs of this appeal.
Appeal allowed.
Agent for the respondent No. 1: Naunit Lal.
Agent for the respondent No. 2: P.K. Chatterjee.
","A receiver cannot be appointed in execution of a decree in respect of a compulsory deposit in a Provident Fund due to the judgment debtor.
Whatever doubts may have existed under the earlier Act of 1897, the definition of ""compulsory deposit"" in section 2 (a) of the Provident Funds Act (XlX of 1925) clearly includes deposits remaining to the credit of the subscriber or depositor after he has retired from serv ice.
Arrears of salary and allowances stand upon a different footing and are not exempt from being proceeded against in execution.

Petition under article 32 of the Constitution of India for enforcement of fundamental rights by quashing the orders of the Deputy Commissioner and House Rent Controller, Banga lore, allotting the petitioner 's house to the 3rd respondent and for taking forcible possession of the same.
S.K. Venkataranga Iyengar for the petitioner.
A.R. Somanatha Iyer, Advocate General of Mysore, (R. Ganapathy Iyer, with him) for the respondent No. 1.
K. Ramaseshayya Chowdhury for the respondent No. 2. 1952.
May 26 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by 746 CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
This is an application under article 32 of the Constitution for quashing the orders of the Deputy Commissioner and House Rent Controller, Banga lore, (2nd respondent) allotting house No. 291, Fifth Main Road, Gandhi Nagar, Bangalore City, for the use of Sri Aswathanarayana Rao (3rd respondent) and taking forcible possession of the same.
The State of Mysore has been im pleaded as the first respondent, The facts are these.
The petitioner D.K. Nabhirajiah is a merchant and is the owner of the premises aforesaid.
After lengthy litigation, the previous tenant of the premises vacated it on 1st September, 1949.
On 2nd Septem ber, 1949, the petitioner notified the vacancy to the 2nd respondent as required by law but added that he wanted the premises for his own use to set up one.of his grown up sons in a business in electrical goods.
The third respondent Aswathanarayana Rao however wanted the house for a chil dren 's school which he was running under the name of Bala Mandir and so he not only applied to the Rent Controller for allotting to him that house but also moved the Minister for Law and 'Labour for the same purpose.
The second respondent made an order on 13th September, 1949, in the following terms: ""With reference to your vacancy report in respect the above place you are informed under clause 3 (2) of the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order, 1948 that the building is required for the occupation of Balamandira Home for the children and for residential use of the Direc tor.
You are therefore directed under clause 3 (4) of the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order, 1948 to hand over possession of the above house to the said Sri Aswathanarayana Rao, Director, Balamandira.
"" By an order dated 20th September, 1949, made on an appli cation by the petitioner dated 16th September, 1949, the Deputy Commissioner refused to reconsider the allotment and required the petitioner to give effect to the same at once and deliver possession to the allottee, 747 The petitioner preferred an appeal to the Commissioner of Labour who is the House Rent Control Appellate Authority and obtained a stay, but the appeal was eventually dismissed and the said order vacated on 28th December.
He filed a Revision Petition No. 97 of 1949 50 before the Government of Mysore but without success and the Government declined to interfere by their order dated 14th March, 1950.
He then resorted to the High Court of Mysore by means of a petition under section 45 of the Mysore Specific Relief Act.
This again was dismissed on the ground that the party who seeks to obtain an order under the said section cannot do so on the allegation that the statute which enjoins the doing or for bearing of the act is itself illegal or ultra vires.
Applications moved under article 226 of the Constitution in the course of the same proceedings also failed.
This was on 5th January, 1951.
Some intermediate steps may now be set out.
The third respondent complained that he had not been given possession.
On this complaint, the second respondent passed an order on the 20th March, 1950, to the following effect : ""Sri Aswathanarayana Rao, the allottee of the above house, has reported that you have not handed over possession of the house to him.
You are required to show cause immedi ately why you should not be prosecuted for failure t0 obey the order.
Please note that if the house is not handed over to the allottee, action will be taken under clause 3 (6) to take forcible possession of the house through police.
"" The petitioner lodged a protest against this order pointing out that the House Rent Accommodation Control Order did not vest the Controller with jurisdiction to allot the house, but on 23rd March, 1950, he received the following reply: ""Your letters under reference have been examined care fully.
It is not correct to say that allotment of a house to any party (private)is illegal.
Clause 3 of 97 748 the Mysore House Rent Control Order, 1948, is amended to include any person also.
I do not find any other reason except that you are evading to give possession to the allot tee.
You are hereby finally warned that if possession is not given to the allottee action will be taken to prosecute you and take forcible possession of the house.
"" On 11th April, 1950, the second respondent made the following order: ""Whereas premises No. 291, Fifth Main Road, Gandhi Nagar was allotted to Sri Aswathanarayana Rao of Balamandira The owner 's appeal before the Labour Commissioner and Government having been rejected the owner filed a petition before the High Court of Mysore who passed an interim order and which was vacated by the order referred to above.
A subsequent appeal before the Labour Commissioner has also been reject ed and stay vacated in Endorsement in H.R.C. 1/1940 50 dated 10th April, 1950.
I therefore direct the owner Sri D. K Nabhirajiah to hand over possession of the said house to Sri Aswathanarayana Rao at once, failing which, I authorise the Superintendent of Police, Bangalore City or any other offi cer empowered by him in his behalf to take possession of the house and hand over to the allottee, Sri Aswathanarayana Rao."" As this order was not obeyed by the petitioner, forcible possession was taken of the house with police help and the third respondent was given possession.
The petitioner seeks to quash the above mentioned orders of the second respondent dated 20th September, 1949, 20th March, 1950, 23rd March, 1950, and 11th April, 1950.
The prayer in the petition is thus worded: ""for quashing the orders of the second respondent No. 522 Acc.
(b) 49 dated 20th September, 1949, confirmed by Appellate Authority in H.R.C. Appeal No. 117 of 1949 1950 dated 28th December, 1949, and by the Government of Mysore in H.R.C. Revision Petition No. 97 of 1949 1950 dated 14th March 749 1950, and also the subsequent orders of the second respondent No. 562 Acc.
(b) 50 dated 20th March, 1950, 23rd March, 1950, and 11th April, 1950, respectively allotting and taking over forcible possession of the property No. 291, Fifth Main Road.
Gandhi Nagar, Bangalore City, for the use of a private individual, the third re spondent, and for costs.
"" The contention of the petitioner is a threefold one, namely : (1) The order allotting the premises to the third re spondent contravenes the provisions of article 31, sub clause (2) and article 19 (1} (f) of the Constitution.
(2) The order is discriminatory and offends article 14 of the Constitution.
(3) Under the Defence of India Rules under which the Accommodation Control Order was made, the allotment can only be of houses available for letting.
It will be convenient here to set out the relevant legis lative provisions.
The Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order, 1948, (hereinafter referred to for the sake of convenience as the Control Order) was made in exercise of the powers conferred by clause (bb) of sub rule (2) of Rule 81 of the Defence of India Rules as applied to Mysore, and it came into force with effect from 1st July, 1948.
Clause 3 of the Control Order provides, subject to two exceptions, for notice being given by the landlord to the Controller within seven days after a house becomes vacant.
Subclause (2), as it originally stood, was in the following terms : ""(2) If within ten days of the receipt by the Controller of a notice under sub clause (1), the Controller does not intimate the landlord in writing that the house is required for the purposes of the Government of Mysore, or of the Central Government, or of the Government of an Indian Prov ince or State, or of any local authority or public body, or of any educational or other public institution for the occupation of any 750 officer of any such Government authority, body or institu tion, the landlord shall be at liberty to let the house to any tenant, or if the Controller, on application made by the landlord permits the landlord to do so, to occupy the house himself.
"" By a notification dated 4th May, 1949, the words: ""or for the occupation of any individual"" were added after the words ""body or institution"" in the said sub section.
The sub clause as amended runs thus: ""(2) If within ten days of the receipt by the Controller of a notice under sub clause (1), the Controller does not intimate the landlord in writing that the house is required for the purposes of the Government of Mysore, or of the Central Government, or of the Government of an Indian Prov ince or State, or of any local authority or public body, or of any educational or other public institution, or for the occupation of any officer of any such Government authority.
body or institution or for the occupation of any individual, the landlord shall be at liberty to let the house to any tenant, or if the Controller on application made by the landlord, permits the landlord to do so, to occupy the house himself.
"" Sub clause (8) says : ""The landlord shall not let the house to a tenant or occupy it himself, before the expiry of the period of ten days specified in sub clause (2), unless he has received intima tion that the house is not required for the purposes re ferred to in that sub clause or the permission referred to therein, earlier."" To this sub clause, a proviso was added by a notification to the following effect: ""Provided that the Controller, before requiring the house for any of the purposes stated above, shall take into consideration such representation, if any, as may be made by the owner regarding his bona fide requirements for personal occupation.
"" Then comes sub clause (4) which reads as follows : ""(4) If the house is required for any of the purposes or for the occupation by any of the officers 751 specified in sub clause (2)the landlord shall deliver pos session of the house to the Government authority, body or institution concerned and such Government authority or body or institution shall be deemed to be the tenant of the landlord, with retrospective effect from the date on which the Controller received notice under sub clause (1), the terms of the tenancy being such as may be agreed upon be tween the landlord and, the tenant: Provided that the rent payable shall not exceed the fair rent which may be payable for the house under the provisions of this Order.
"" The Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order of 1948 was repealed by the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Act XXX of 1951.
But what is relevant and material for disposal of this petition is the earlier Control Order as all the proceedings now in question were taken under it.
If the allotment had been made under the Control Order prior to the date of its amendment on 4th May, 1949, the petitioner would have had a good case to urge.
Sub clause (2) as it then stood spoke of the house being required for certain specified purposes or for any educational or other public institution, or for the occupation of an officer of any Government authority, body or institution;and the house could not have been required for the occupation of a private individual.
But the amendment has enlarged the scope of the power of the Controller by providing that the requirement may also be for the occupation of any individu al.
The answer to the first contention based on article 31 (2) or article 19(1) (I) of the Constitution is a short one.
The Constitution came into force on the 26th January, 1950, after the impugned orders were made and at a time when there was nothing like a chapter of Fundamental Rights.
The argu ment that the requisition in the present case was not for any public purpose and the restriction on the respondent to hold property must be in the interests of the general public presupposes that the Constitution governs the case.
This 752 assumption, however, is not well founded.
The order of allotment was made before the Constitution came into force and at a time when the Control Order provided, validly, that a house could be taken for the occupation of a private individual.
During the period of 10 days specified in sub clause (2), the landlord could not let the house or occupy it himself, and on allotment, he was bound to deliver up possession to the allottee.
His rights as landlord were thus at an end so far as possession was concerned.
Whether retrospective effect could be given to article 13 (1) of the Constitution arose for decision in Keshavan Madhava Menon vs The State of Bombay(1).
Dealing with the argument that the said article rendered voidab initio and for all purposes an earlier law which was inconsistent with fundamental rights, it was laid down by this Court in that case ""that such laws existed for all past transactions and for enforcing all rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution."" (Per Das J., at page 234).
Mr. Justice Mahajan observed at pages 249 and 250: ""It is admitted that after the 26th January, 1950, there has been no infringement of the appellant 's right of freedom of speech or expression.
In September, 1949, he did not enjoy either complete freedom of speech or full freedom of expression.
It is in relation to the freedom guaranteed in article 19 (1) of the Constitution to the citizen that the provisions of article 13 (1) come into play.
the article does not declare any law void independ ently of the existence of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III.
A citizen must be possessed of a fundamental right before he can ask the court to declare a law which is incon sistent with it void; but if a citizen is not possessed of the right, he cannot claim this relief.
"" These remarks have application here.
The learned Advocate for the petitioner sought to get over this difficulty by pointing out that the (1) ; 753 dispossession took 'place on 11 4 1950.
This, however, is no answer.
The dispossession was a mere consequence which followed under clause '3, sub clause (6) of the Control Order.
The right to possession was lost earlier and the landlord merely held on to the property.
Article31 (2)does not apply for another reason.
There was no acquisition by the State of the house.
The taking of possession can only be from a person who is entitled to possession.
The petitioner landlord lost his right to possession by reason of the Controller 's order.
As soon as the allotment is made, the allottee becomes a tenant and the owner becomes the landlord by reason of sub clause (4)of the Control Order and the learned Advocate General of the Mysore State contended that a statutory tenancy was thereby created.
It is no doubt true that it is provided by sub clause (4) that the terms of the tenancy may be such as may be agreed upon between the landlord and the tenant, and there is no provision, as found in the later Act, as to what is to happen in the event of there being no agreement.
If it is correct that a tenancy is brought into existence by the operation of the statute, it is possible that in case the terms are not the subject of any agreement between the landlord and the tenant, the ordinary law of landlord and tenant will apply in the absence of any provision for the fixation of terms by the Controller.
But the point does not arise for decision in this case and nothing.
further need be said about it.
The applicability of sub clause (4) of the Control Order was sought to be avoided in another manner.
It was pointed out that sub clause (2) referred in its first part ""to the purposes of the Government of Mysore"" etc., and in its later part ""for the occupation of any officer or any such Govern ment authority, body or corporation, or for the occupation of an individual"", but that when we come to sub clause (4), the two categories are kept distinct or separate and in referring to the second category the Control Order 754 speaks only of the requirement of the house for the occupa tion by any of the officers and nothing is said about the occupation of any individual.
The amending Act did not introduce the words ""or for the occupation of any individu al"" into sub clause (4).
Therefore, it was urged that the whole basis of the Advocate General 's contention about a statutory tenancy being created fell to the ground.
At first sight, there seems to be something in the point.
But if sub clause (2) is read as a whole, having in 'view the object sought to be achieved by the legislation, it is fairly clear that there is no such necessary antithesis between the two categories or clauses and that the words ""for the purposes"" can be so read as to include ""occupation"" also. 'the omission of the words ""for the purposes"" in the latter part of sub clause (2) was perhaps to avoid inartis tic phraseology.
""For the occupation"" certainly reads better than ""for the purposes of the occupation"".
Ground No. 2 regarding discrimination was not pressed.
Then, we come to ground No 3.
Clause (bb) of sub clause (2) of Rule 81 of the Defence of India Rules is in these terms: ""(bb) for regulating the letting and sub letting of any accommodation or class of accommodation, whether residential or non residential, whether furnished or unfurnished and whether with or without board, and in particular, (i) for controlling the rents for such accommodation (either generally or when let to specified persons or classes of persons or in specified circumstances); ((ii) for preventing the eviction of tenants and sub tenants from such 'accommodation in specified circumstances and); (iii) for requiring such accommodation to be let either generally, or to specified persons or classes of persons, or in specified circumstances; . ,"" 755 It was urged that the power conferred under this sub clause applied only to those cases where the house was available for letting or sub letting and not to eases where a house was not so available, in other words, if the land lord of any premises said that they were required for his own occupation, the Government had no power to requisition the same, Emphasis was laid on the word ""regulating"".
This, however, is an obviously unsound interpretation to be placed upon the words.
They mean that the Government might provide for and regulate the letting and sub letting etc., and that such is the scope is clear from the words in sub clause (2) ""may by order provide"".
The argument for the petitioner, if accepted, would render the powers entirely nugatory, as it would then be open to every landlord to say that the prem ises are required for self occupation, or even that he has already let it out to another and that therefore it is not available for being let.
There was no requisition of property in this case under section 75 (A) of the Defence of India Rules.
The Control Order was promulgated under rule 81 (2) (bb) which provides for the regulation of letting and sub letting houses.
It is rather the exercise of a police power of regulation in public interest than anything done in the exercise of a power of eminent domain, in which case alone questions relating to compensation and public purpose will arise.
In the course of the arguments, it was suggested that the amendment notification of 4th May, 1949, introducing the words ""or for the occupation of any individual"" was invalid because the regulation of letting and sub letting under clause (bb) could only be for the Defence of British India or for the efficient prosecution of the war, or for main taining supplies and services essential to the life of the community, and that the taking of property for the occupa tion of a private individual was outside the scope of the power.
Apart from the fact that no such ground has been taken in the petition, it has also to be noted that 98 756 the Control Order purports to have been made not only under clause (bb) of sub rule (2) of rule 81 of the Defence of India Rules, but also under the Supplies, Services and Miscellaneous Provisions (Temporary Powers) Act of 1947.
We have not got this Act before us and it was not even referred to in the course of the arguments.
Hence no decision is called for on this point.
The petition fails and is dismissed without any order as to costs.
Petition dismissed.

","A house belonging to the petitioner in the Bangalore City fell vacant on the 1st September, 1949, and on the 13th September, 1949, an order was passed by the Rent Con troller 745 under the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order, 1948, allotting the house to another person and directing the petitioner to deliver possession to the lat ter.
The petitioner protested and took various steps to get the order vacated but he was unsuccessful and forcible possession was taken from him under an order made on the 11th April, 1950.
He applied to the Supreme Court under article 32 of the Constitution for quashing the order allotting the house and the subsequent orders made to enforce that order, on the ground, infer alia, that these orders contravened the provisions of articles 31 (2) and 19 (1) (f) of the Consti tution: Held, (i) that as the order of allotment was made before the Constitution came into force and at a time when the Control Order provided, validly, that a house could be taken for the occupation of a private individual, the order could not be impugned on the ground that it contravened article 31 (2) or 19 (1)(f) of the Constitution: (ii) the fact that possession was actually taken only in pursuance of an order made on the 11th April, 1950, was immaterial as the peti tioner 's right to possession was lost earlier; (iii) article 31 (2) was inapplicable for another reason also, namely, that there was no acquisition of the house by the State, as taking of possession can only be from a person who is enti tled to possession and the landlord lost his right to pos session by reason of the Controller 's order.
Held also, that the power conferred by cl.
(bb) of sub cl.
(2) of Rule 81 of the Defence of India Rules (under which the Control Order was made) was not confined to cases where the house was available for letting or subletting in the sense that the landlord did not require the house for his own use or had not let it to another himself.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J.
This is an appeal from the judgment of the High Court of Judicature of the State of Punjab dated the 24th May, 1951, dismissing the petition filed by the appel lants for writs of certiorari, prohibition and mandamus against the respondent.
Aboobaker Abdul Rahman, the father of the appellants, was ,possessed of considerable movable as well as immovable properties including a. cinema theatre, known as the Imperi al Cinema.
situateat Bombay.
Soon after the partition of India, he went to Pakistan and was in Karachi in the month of September, 1947, where he purchased certain properties in that month.
On information supplied by one Tek Chand Dolwani to the Additional Custodian of Evacuee Property, the Addi tional Custodian started proceedings under the Bombay Evacu ees (Administration of Property) Act, 1949, against Aboobak er in or about the month of July, 1949.
During the pendency of the said proceedings, the Government of India Ordinance XXVII of 1949 came into force.
Thereupon, on the 16th Decem ber, 1949, the Additional Custodian issued a notice to the said Aboobaker under section 7 of the Ordinance and a fur ther notice on the 11th January, 1950, to show cause why his property should not be declared to be evacuee property.
Pursuant to the said notices an enquiry was held by the Additional Custodian of Evacuee Property who after recording the statement of the said Aboobaker and examining some other evidence produced by the said Tekchand Dolwani and taking into consideration the written statement filed by him, adjudicated on the 8th February, 1950, that 699 the said Aboobaker was not an evacuee.
He, however, issued another notice to Aboobaker on the same day calling upon him to show cause why he should not be declared an intending evacuee under section 19 of the said Ordinance.
On the 9th February, 1950, he adjudicated him as an intending evacuee.
On the 31st March, 1950, Tekchand Dolwani being the informant and interested in the adjudication of the said Aboobaker as an evacuee, filed an appeal against the order of the 9th February to the respondent (The Custodian General of India) praying for an order declaring the said Aboobaker an evacuee and that he being the first informant should be allotted the said cinema.
On the 18th April.
1950, the Ordinance was replaced by Act XXXI of 1950.
The appeal was heard by the respondent in New Delhi on the 13th May. 1950.
At the hearing it was urged on behalf of Aboobaker that he having been declared an intending evacuee and he having accepted that order, no appeal lay therefrom and that the said Tekchand Dolwani was not a person ag grieved by any order passed by the Additional Custodian and therefore had no locus standi to appeal under the provisions of section 24 of Ordinance XXVII of 1949.
The hearing of the appeal was concluded on the lath May, 1951 and it is alleged in the written statement of the respondent that the order was dictated by him on the same day after the conclusion of the hearing and was also signed by him and it bore that date.
Aboobaker suddenly died on the 14th May, 1950, which was a Sunday and the respondent pronounced the order written on the 13th to the counsel of Aboobaker on the 15th May, 1950.
By this order the respond ent held that the appeal purporting to be from the order passed by the Additional Custodian on the 9th February, 1950, declaring the said Aboobaker an intending evacuee in effect and in substance was directed against the order made on the 8th February in the proceedings started under section 7 of the Ordinance declining to declare the said Aboobaker 's property as evacuee property.
700 He further held that the said Tekchand Dolwani was interest ed in the appeal and had locus standi to prefer it.
Having overruled the preliminary objections raised by the appel lants, the hearing of the appeal was adjourned and further inquiry was directed to be made in the matter.
Notices of the adjourned hearing of the appeal were given from time to time to the two appellants.
On the 30th February, 1951, they were informed that the appeal would be heard on the 7th March, 1951.
The two appellants allege that they are some of the heirs enti tled to the estate of the said Aboobaker.
Two of his sons migrated to Pakistan and one of the appellants is his third son and the other appellant is his only daughter.
Being aggrieved by the order of the respondent dated the lath May, 1950, the appellants filed a petition in the High Court of the State of Punjab at Simla on the 26th February, 1951, under article 226 of the Constitution, praying for a writ of certiorari for quashing and setting aside that order and for a writ of prohibition or mandamus directing the said respondent to forbear from proceeding with the hearing of the said appeal on the 7th March, 1951, or on any other date or dates.
The appellants raised the following contentions in the petition: 1.
That the appeal preferred by Tekchand Dolwani before the respondent was in terms an appeal against the order of the 9th February, 1950, and not an appeal against the conclusion reached on the 8th February, 1950, and inas much as the said order was made against Aboobaker and not in his favour, Tekchand had no right of appeal against the same and the respondent had no jurisdiction to entertain it or make any order therein.
That Tekchand was not a person aggrieved by the order dated the 8th February, 1950, within the meaning of section 24 of the Ordinance and was not entitled to appeal against the said order and inasmuch as no appeal lay at his instance, the respondent had no jurisdiction to entertain it or make any order therein.
701 3.
That after the death of Aboobaker on the 14th May, 1950, the respondent ceased to have jurisdiction to proceed with the hearing of the appeal or make any order therein.
The High Court held that the order of the respondent pronounced on the 15th May, 1950, was not a nullity and the appeal preferred by Tekehand was in effect and in substance an appeal from the order passed by the Additional Custodian on the 8th February, 1950, and that Tekchand was a person aggrieved within the meaning of section 24 of the Ordi nance.
It accordingly dismissed the petition with costs but on the 27th June, 1950, granted him leave to appeal to this Court under article 133 of the Constitution.
On the 30th July, 1951, during the pendency of the appeal in this Court, the respondent finally pronounced orders on the appeal of Tekchand and held that Aboobaker was an evacuee and his property was declared evacuee property.
A petition under article 226 for quashing.
this order is pending in the High Court of the State of Bombay.
The learned counsel for the appellants canvassed the following points before us: 1.
That the appeal to the respondent was against the order of the 9th and not against the order of the 8th, and as no appeal lay against the order of the 9th the respondent had no jurisdiction to hear it.
That assuming that the appeal was preferred against the order of the 8th, that order was not an appealable order inasmuch as section 24 allows an appeal against an order declaring properties evacuee properties and not against any conclusion that a certain person is or is not an evacuee, and thus no appeal was Competent at all which could be heard by the respondent.
That Tekchand was not a person aggrieved within the meaning of section 24 of the Ordinance and had no locus standi to prefer the appeal and the respondent had no juris diction to entertain it at his instance.
702 4.
That the order pronounced on the 15th after the death of Aboobaker was a nullity.
It is mentioned in the judgment of the High Court that Shri M.L. Manekshah conceded that the death of Aboobaker does 'not in any way affect the validity of the order pro nounced by the Custodian General on the 15th May, 1950.
The learned counsel adopted practically the same attitude before us in view of the affidavit of the respondent in which it was affirmed that the order in question was dictated on the 13th May, 1950, and was signed on the same date.
the High Court on the principle of Order XXII, Rule 6, Code of Civil Procedure, held that an order written but not pronounced could be pronounced even after the death of the party af fected.
In these circumstances the last contention of the learned counsel does not require any further consideration and is rejected.
The larger question that has been raised in the petition pending before the High Court of the State of Bombay that the properties of Aboobaker could not be declared evacuee properties after his death as they had devolved on his heirs was not raised in these proceedings and we have not been invited to decide it.
That being so, the question is left open.
The remaining three questions canvassed before us, unless they are of such a nature as would make the decision of the respondent dated the 13th May, 1950, a nullity, cannot be the subject matter of a writ of certiorari.
It is plain that such a writ cannot be granted to quash the deci sion of an inferior court within its jurisdiction on the ground that the decision is wrong.
Indeed, it must be shown before such a writ is issued that the authority which passed the order acted without jurisdiction or in excess of it or in violation of the principles of natural justice.
Want of jurisdiction may arise from the nature of the subjectmatter, so that the inferior court might not have authority to enter on the inquiry or upon some part of it.
It may also arise from the absence of some essential preliminary or upon the existence of some 703 particular facts collateral to the actual matter which the court has to try and which are conditions precedent to the assumption of jurisdiction by it.
But once it is held that the court has jurisdiction but while exercising it, it made a mistake, the wronged party can only take the course pre scribed by law for setting matters right inasmuch as a court has jurisdiction to decide rightly as well as wrongly.
The three questions agitated before us do not seem to be ques tions which bear upon the jurisdiction of the court of appeal, or its authority to entertain them.
It was contended that no court of limited jurisdiction can give itself jurisdiction by a wrong decision a point collateral to the merits of the case upon which the limit of its jurisdiction depends and that the questions involved in the appeal before the respondent were collateral to the merits of the case.
As pointed out by Lord Esher, M.R., in Reg.
vs Commissioner Income Tax(1),, the formula enunciated above is quite plain but its application is often mislead ing.
The learned Master of the Rolls classified the cases under two categories thus: ""When an inferior court or tribunal or body which has to exercise the power of deciding facts, first established by Act of Parliament, the legislature has to consider what powers it will give that tribunal or body.
It may in effect say that, if a certain stab of facts exists and is shown to such tribunal or body before it proceeds to do certain things, it shall have jurisdiction to do such things but not otherwise.
There it is not for them conclusively to decide whether that state of facts exists, and, if they exercise the jurisdiction without its existence, what they do may be questioned, and it will be held that they have acted without jurisdiction.
But there is another state of things which may exist.
The legislature may entrust the tribunal on body with a jurisdiction which includes the jurisdiction, to determine whether the preliminary state of facts exists as well as the jurisdiction, and on finding that it doe: exist, to proceed further or do something more.
Wher (1) 21 Q .B DD. 313.
704 the legislature are establishing such a tribunal or body with limited jurisdiction, they also have to consider what ever jurisdiction they give them, whether there shall be any appeal from their decision, for otherwise there will be none.
In the second of the two cases I have mentioned it is erroneous application of the formula to say that the tribu nal cannot give themselves jurisdiction by wrongly deciding certain facts to exist, because the legislature gave them jurisdiction to determine all the facts.
including the existence of the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends; and if they were given jurisdiction so to decide, without any appeal being given, there is no appeal from such exercise of their juris diction.
"" The tribunal constituted to hear appeals under section 24 has been constituted in these terms: ""Any person aggrieved by an order made under section 7, section 16, section 19 or section 38 may prefer an appeal in such manner and within such time as may be prescribed (a) to the Custodian, where the original order has been passed by a Deputy or Assistant Custodian; (b) to the Custodian General, where the original order has been passed by the Custodian, an Additional Custodian or an Authorized Deputy Custodian.
"" Like all courts of appeal exercising general jurisdic tion in civil cases, the respondent has been constituted an appellate court in words of the widest amplitude and the legislature has not limited his jurisdiction by providing that such exercise will depend on the existence of any particular state of facts.
Ordinarily, a court of appeal has not only jurisdiction to determine the soundness of the decision of the inferior court as a court of error, but by the very nature of things it has also jurisdiction to deter mine any points raised before it in the nature of prelimi nary issues by the parties.
Such jurisdiction is inherent in its very constitution as a court of appeal.
Whether an appeal is competent, whether a party has locus standi to prefer it, whether the appeal in substance is from one or another order 705 and whether it has been preferred in proper form and within the time prescribed, are all matters for the decision of the appellate court so constituted.
Such a tribunal falls within class 2 of the classification of the Master of the Rolls.
In these circumstances it seems to us that the order of the High Court of Punjab that a writ of certiorari could not issue to the respondent quashing the order of the 13th May, 1950, was right.
We are further of the opinion that none of the contentions raised has any merit whatsoever.
For a proper appraisal of the contention that Tekchand Dolwani is not a ""person aggrieved"" within the meaning of those words in section 24 of the Ordinance, it is necessary to refer to the rules made under the Ordinance.
It is provided in rule S (5), that any person or persons claiming to be interested in the enquiry or in the property being declared as evacuee property, may file a written statement in reply to the written statement filed by the persons interested in the property claiming that the property should not be declared evacuee property; the Custodian shall then either on the same day or on any subsequent day to which the hearing may be adjourned, proceed to hear the evidence, if any, which the party appearing to show cause may produce and also evidence which the party claiming to be interested as mentioned above may adduce.
In the proceedings before the Additional Custodian, Tekchand Dolwani filed a reply to the written statement of Aboobaker and adduced evidence in support of the stand taken by him that the property of Aboobaker was evacuee property.
Further Tekchand Dolwani was the first informant who brought to the notice of the Custodian concerned that the property of Aboobaker was evacuee property and in view of the order of the Ministry of Rehabilitation he was, as a first informant, entitled to first consideration in the allotment of this property, the Additional Custodian was bound to hear him on the truth and validity of the information given by him.
When a person is given a right to raise a contest in a certain matter and his contention is negatived, then 706 to say that he is not a person aggrieved by the order does not seem to us to be at all right or proper.
He is certain ly aggrieved by the order disallowing his contention.
Sec tion 24 allows a right of appeal to any person aggrieved by an order made under section 7.
The conclusion reached by the Additional Custodian on the 8th February, 1950, that Aboo baker was not an evacuee amounted to an order under section 7 and Tekchand therefore was a person aggrieved by that order.
Section 43 bars the jurisdiction of the civil court in matters which fall within the jurisdiction of the Custo dian.
In clause 1 (a) it provides as follows: ""no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain or adjudicate upon any question whether any property is or is not evacuee property or whether an evacuee has or has not any right or interest in any evacuee property .
"" It is clear therefore that the Additional Custodian has to find and adjudicate on the question whether a certain property is or is not evacuee property and whether a certain person is or is not an evacuee and such an adjudication falls within the ambit of section 7 of the Ordinance.
Lord Esher M.R. in In re Lamb, Ex parte Board of Trade(1) observed as follows : ""The meaning of the term 'person aggrieved ' was ex plained by this Court in Ex parte Official Receiver U).
It was there determined that any person who makes an applica tion to a Court for a decision, or any person who. is brought before a Court to submit to a decision, is, if the decision goes against him, thereby a 'person aggrieved ' by that decision."" Lord Justice Kay in the same judgment made the following observations: ""The preliminary objection to the appeal is two/old: (1) It is said that the Board of 'trade are not 'persons aggrieved '.
They are persons whom the court was bound to hear, If they wished to be heard, on the validity of this objection, and the decision has (1) (2) 707 been against them.
How it can be said that they are not 'persons aggrieved ', by the decision, passes my understand ing.
When two persons are in the position of litigants before the High Court, and the decision of the Court goes against one of them, how it can be said that he is not a 'person aggrieved ' by the decision, I cannot understand.
I am clearly of opinion that the Board were 'persons ag grieved ' by this decision.
Then (2) it is said that the decision is not an 'order '.
When the High Court makes a declaration of right, and further orders the costs of the application to be paid (which is the common form here used), and that is drawn up and sealed with the seal of the Court, and, I suppose placed on record, as all orders of the High Court are, it seems to me that it is clearly an order of the Court.
"" In our opinion, Tekchand Dolwani is a person aggrieved within the rule stated in the decision mentioned above and the respondent rightly held that he had locus standi to prefer the appeal.
The next point urged was that the appeal had been pre ferred against the order of the 9th February and not against the order of the 8th and that the respondent had no juris diction to hear it.
Whether the appeal in substance had been preferred against the order of the 8th or the order of the 9th was a matter which was certainly within the compe tence of the respondent to decide and does not involve any question of jurisdiction whatsoever.
Be that as it may.
we have examined the memorandum of appeal presented by Tekchand Dolwani to the respondent and it appears to us that the High Court was right when it held that the appeal was in effect and in substance an appeal from the order passed by the Additional Custodian on the 8th February.
The relief claimed in appeal concerns the order of the 8th and the grounds of appeal only relate to this matter.
The only defect pointed out was in the description of the order attacked in appeal.
It is well settled that such errors of description cannot be allowed to prejudice the right of a party.
The two 708 orders of the 8th and 9th made on consecutive days, though under different provisions of the Ordinance, were inter linked and the latter order was merely consequential on the conclusion reached on the 8th and the description in the memorandum of appeal that the appeal was against the order of the 9th cannot be considered as really an error of a kind of which serious notice could be taken.
The last point raised before us was not taken in the High Court and therefore we have not the benefit of that court 's decision on the point.
It was contended that no appeal lay against the order of the Additional Custodian dated the 8th February declining to declare Aboobaker an evacuee, that the only order that the Custodian is entitled to pass under section 7 is an order declaring any property to be evacuee property and that it is this order and this order alone which is appealable under section 24.
In our opinion, this contention is without force.
Section 24 con fers a right of appeal against all orders made under section 7 and does not specify the nature of the orders made appeal able.
In an enquiry under section 7 the first point for adjudication is whether a certain person falls within the definition of the word ""evacuee"" given in the Ordinance.
Ii he comes within the ambit of the definition, then any property heldby him becomes evacuee property.
The civil court is barred from entertaining or adjudicating upon the questions whether the property is or is not evacuee proper ty, or whether an evacuee has any right or interest in any evacuee property.
The decision of the Custodian whether in the affirmative or in the negative amounts to an adjudica tion under section 7 and is as such appealable.
It was contended that when the Custodian reached the conclusion that a certain person is not an evacuee, then he is not entitled to make any order whatsoever but has just to file the proceedings.
This contention is unsound.
When a certain person claiming to be interested in getting a property declared evacuee property is allowed to put in a written statement and lead 709 evidence, then the decision of the court whether favourable or unfavourable to him has to take the form of an adjudica tion and necessarily amounts to an order.
Reference in this connection may be made to the decision of the Federal Court in Rayarappan Nayanar vs Madhavi Amma(1) on an analogous,provision of the Code of Civil Procedure contained in Orders XL, Rule 1, and XLIII, Rule 1 (s).
Order XLIII, Rule 1 (s) makes any order made under Order XL, Rule 1, appealable, while Order XL, Rule 1, only empowers the court to appoint a receiver.
It was held that the order removing a receiver was appealable under Order XLIII, Rule 1, inas much as such an order fell within the ambit of Order XL, Rule 1, and the power of appointing a receiver included the power of removing or dismissing him.
The present case stands on a higher footing.
The power of granting a certain relief includes obviously the power of refusing that relief.
In our opinion, therefore, the order made by the Additional Custodian refusing to declare Aboobaker an evacuee and his property evacuee property was an order made under section 7 of the Ordinance and was therefore appealable under section, 24.
The result is that this appeal fails and is dismissed with costs.
Appeal dismissed.
","A writ of certiorari cannot be granted to quash the decision of an inferior court within its jurisdiction on the ground that the decision is wrong.
It must be shown before such a writ is issued that the authority which passed the order acted without jurisdiction or in excess of it, or in violation of the principles of natural justice.
Want of jurisdiction may arise from the nature of the subject mat ter, so that the inferior court might not have authority to enter on the inquiry or upon some part 0 697 it.
It may also arise from the absence of some essential preliminary or upon the existence of some particular facts collateral to the actual matter which the court has to try and which are conditions precedent to the assumption of jurisdiction by it.
But once it is held that the court has jurisdiction but while exercising it, it made a mistake, the wronged party can only take the course prescribed by law for setting matters right inasmuch as a court has jurisdiction to decide rightly as well as wrongly.
When an inferior court or tribunal which has the power of deciding facts is established by the legislature.
it may in effect say that, if a certain state of facts exists and is shown to such tribunal or body before it proceeds to do certain things, it shall have jurisdiction to do such things but not otherwise.
There, it is not for them conclusively to decide whether that state of facts exists, and, if they exercise the jurisdiction without its existence, what they do may be questioned, and it will be held that they have acted without jurisdiction.
But the legislature may entrust the court or tribunal itself with a jurisdiction which includes the jurisdiction to determine whether the prelimi nary state of facts exists and on finding that it does exist, to proceed further or do something more.
In the second case the rule that a tribunal cannot give itself jurisdiction by wrongly deciding certain facts to exist does not apply.
Ordinarily, a court of appeal has not only jurisdiction to determine the soundness of the decision of the inferior court as a court of error, but by the very nature of things it has also jurisdiction to determine any points raised before it in the nature of preliminary issues by the par ties.
Such jurisdiction is inherent in its very constitu tion as a court of appeal.
Whether an appeal is competent, whether a party has locus standi to prefer it, whether the appeal in substance is from one or another order and whether it has been preferred in proper form and within the time prescribed, are all matters for the decision of the appel late court so constituted.
An order by an Additional Custodian in a proceeding under Ordinance No. XXVII of 1949 refusing to declare a person an evacuee and his property evacuee property is an order under section 7 of of the Ordinance and is appealable under section 24.
A person claiming to be interested in an enquiry as to whether a person is an evacuee and his property evacuee property, who has filed a written statement and adduced evidence, is a ""person aggrieved"" by an order that the latter is not an evacuee and has a locus standi to prefer an appeal from the order.

Appeal under article 132 (1) of the Constitution of India from the Judgment and Order dated 24th October, 1950, of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay (Bavdekar and Vyas JJ.) in Criminal Application No. 1003 of 1950.

Respondent ex parte.

May 26.
This is an appeal from an order of the Bombay High Court directing the release of the respondent who had been detained under section 3 of the Preventive Detention Act of 1950. 'The learned Attorney General states at the outset that Government does not want to re arrest the respondent but merely desires to test the High Court 's decision on certain points which will have far reaching effects on preventive detentions in the State of Bombay.
Following the precedent of their Lordships of the Privy Council in King Emperor vs Vimlabai Deshpande(1) we proceed to decide the appeal but direct that the respondent shall not in any event be re arrested in respect of the matters to which the appeal relates.
The respondent was originally arrested under an order of the District Magistrate, Belgaum, dated the 26th February, 1950, though he was then beyond the jurisdiction of that authority.
On the 11th of .July, 1950, the Bombay High Court held that a detention of that kind was invalid.
The decision was given in the case of In re GhateC (2).
This necessitated a review of 57 cases, among them the respond ent 'section Orders were passed in all those cases on the 17th of July, 1950.
About 52 of the detenus were released and in the remaining cases fresh orders of detention were passed by the Government of Bombay.
In the respondent 's case the order was in these terms: ""Whereas the Government of Bombay is satisfied with respect to the person known as Shri Purushottam Jog Naik of Ulga Village, Taluka Karwar, District Kanara, that with a view to preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order, it is necessary to make the following order: Now, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section (1.) of section 3 of the Preventive (1) I.L.R. at 655.
(2) 677 Detention Act, 1950 (No. IV of 1950), the Government of Bombay is pleased to direct that the said Shri Purushottam Jog Naik be detained.
By order of the Governor of Bombay, Sd/ V. T. Dehejia, Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Home Department.
Dated at Bombay Castle, this 17th day of July, 1950.
"" He was served with the grounds of detention on the 26th of July, 1950, and with a fuller set on the 9th of August.
The original grounds were as follows: ""In furtherance of your campaign for non payment of rent, you were instigating the people in the Belgaum Dis trict to commit acts of violence against landlords.
``In all probability, you will continue to do so.
"" The second set gave the following additional particulars: ""The people in Belgaum District, whom you were instigat ing to commit acts of violence against landlords in further ance of your campaign for non payment of rent, were the tenants in Hadalge and round about villages in the Khanapur Taluka of Belgaum District, and the said instigation was carried on by you for some months till your arrest in April, 1949.
"" On the 24th of August, 1950, the respondent applied to the Bombay High Court under section 491 of the Criminal Proce dure Code for an order of release.
He succeeded, and the appeal is against that order.
The first ground on which the learned High Court Judges proceeded was that the detention order of the 17th July was defective as it was not expressed inproper legal form.
The basis of their reasoning is this.
Article 166(1) of the Constitution requires that "" All executive action of the Government of a State shall be expressed to be taken in the name of the Governor.
"" It will be seen that the order of detention states in the preamble 678 `` Whereas the Government of Bombay is satisfied. "" and the operative part of the order runs "" Now, therefore . the Government of Bombay is pleased to direct etc.
"" It does not say that the Governor of Bombay is pleased to direct.
The learned Judges held that this is not an order expressed to be made in the name of the Governor and accord ingly is not protected by clause (2) of article 166.
They conceded that the State could prove by other means that a valid order had been passed by the proper authority, but they held that the writing, (Record No. 3), which purports to embody the order, cannot be used to prove that a valid order was made because the formula set out in article 166(1) was not employed.
We are unable to agree.
Now we do not wish to encourage laxity of expression, nor do we mean to suggest that ingenious experiments regard ing the permissible limits of departure from the language of a Statute or of the Constitution will be worthwhile, but when all is said and done we must look to the substance of article 166 and of the Order.
The short answer in this case is that the order under consideration is ""expressed"" to be made in the name of the Governor because it says ""By order of the Governor.
"" One of the meanings of ""expressed"" is to make known the opinions or the feelings of a particular person and when a Secretary to Government apprehends a man and tells him in the order that this is being done under the orders of the Governor, he is in substance saying that he is acting in the name of the Governor and, on his behalf, is making known to the detenu the opinion and feelings and orders of the Governor.
In our opinion, the Constitution does not require a magic incanta tion which can only be expressed in a set formula of words.
What we have to see is whether the substance of the require ments is there.
It has to be remembered that this order was made under the , and therefore had to conform to its terms.
Section 3 of the Act provides that the State Government may, if satisfied, 679 ""make an order directing that such person be detained.
"" It is true that under section 3 [(43 a) (a)] of the General Clauses Act the words ""the State Government"" mean the Governor, but if that be so, then the expression must be given the same meaning in the order which merely reproduces the language of section 3, not indeed because the General Clauses Act applies to the order (it does not) but because the order is reproducing the language of the Act and must therefore be taken to have the same meaning as in the Act itself, particularly as the order concludes with the words, "" By order of the Governor of Bombay.
"" It will be noticed that section 3 of the enables certain authorities specified by it to make orders of detention.
These include, not only State Governments but also the Central Government, any District Magistrate or Sub Divisional Magistrate and certain Commis sioners of Police.
The list does not include the Governor of a State.
Now, though the term ""State Government"" appearing in an enactment means the Governor of the State, there is no provision of law which equates the term Governor with the State Government of which he happens to be the head.
On the contrary, the Constitution invests him with certain func tions and powers which are separate from those of his Gov ernment.
It was therefore appropriate that the order in this case should have set out that the Government of Bombay was satisfied and not some other authority not contemplated by the Act and that that Government directed the detention.
It was also proper that the order should have been executed under the orders of the Governor authenticated, under the rules, by the signature of the Secretary.
It is true that addition of the words ""and in his name"" to the words ""By order of the Governor of Bombay"" would have placed the matter beyond controversy but we are unable to see how an order which purports to be an order 680 of the Governor of 'BombaY can fail to be otherwise than in his name.
If A signs his name to a communication that commu nication goes out in his name.
Equally, if he employs an agent to sign on his behalf and the agent states that he is signing under the orders of A, the document still goes forth in the name of A.
In our opinion, the High Court was wrong on this Point The next step in the High Court 's reasoning was this.
The learned Judges held that the writing produced as the order did not prove itself because of the defect we have just considered but that nevertheless it was open to the State Government to prove by other means that such an order had been validly made.
The learned Judges therefore called upon Government to make an affidavit setting out the facts.
An affidavit was made by the Home Secretary but the learned Judges were not satisfied and asked for a further affidavit.
The Home Secretary thereupon made a second one but the learned Judges were i still not satisfied and considered that the Minister in charge should have made an affidavit himself.
We do not intend to discuss this matter because once an order of this kind is unable to prove itself and has to be proved by other means it becomes impossible to lay down any rule regarding either the quantum of evidence necessary to satisfy the Court which is called upon to decide the question or the nature of the evidence required.
This is a question of fact which must be different in each case.
Of course, sitting as a court of appeal, it would have been necessary for us to decide this had we reached a different conclusion on the first point and had the State Government desired the re.arrest of the respondent.
But as we are only asked to deal with general principles, all we need say as regards this is that it is not necessary in every case to call the Minister in charge.
if the Secre tary.
or any other person, has the requisite means of knowledge and his affidavit is believed, that will be enough.
681 We wish, however, to observe that the verification of the affidavits produced here is defective. 'The body of the affidavit discloses that certain matters were known to the Secretary who made the affidavit personally.
The verifica tion however states that everything was true to the best of his information and belief.
We point this out as slipshod verifications of this type might well in a given case lead to a rejection of the affidavit.
Verifications should invar iably be modelled on the lines of Order XIX, rule 3, of the Civil Procedure Code, whether the Code applies in terms or not.
And when the matter deposed to is not based on person al knowledge the sources of information should be clearly disclosed.
We draw attention to the remarks of Jenkins C.J. and Woodroffe J. in Padmabati Dasi vs Rasik Lal Dhar(1) and endorse the learned Judges ' observations.
In fairness to the Home Secretary we deem it right to say that his veracity was neither doubted nor impugned by the High Court, but only his means of knowledge.
He was speaking of the ""satisfaction"" of the Minister and the High Court was not satisfied regarding his knowledge of the state of the Minister 's mind.
The learned Judges considered that the Minister himself would have been a more satisfactory source of information, but as we say, this is not a question of law.
As a matter of abstract law, of course, the state of man 's mind can be proved by evidence other than that of the man himself, and if the Home Secretary has the requisite means of knowledge, for example, if the Minister had told him that he was satisfied or he had indicated satisfaction by his conduct and acts, and the Home Secretary 's affidavit was regarded as sufficient in the particular case, then that would constitute legally sufficient proof.
But whether that would be enough in any given case.
or whether the ' 'best evidence rule"" should be applied in strictness in that particular case, must necessarily depend upon its facts.
In the present case, there was the element that 57 cases were dealt with in the course of 6 days (1) Cal.
682 and orders passed in all on one day.
But we do not intend to enter into the merits.
All we desire to say is that if the learned Judges of the High Court intended to lay down as a proposition of law that an affidavit from the Minister in charge of the department is indispensable in all such cases, then they went too far.
The learned Attorney General contended that the Minis ter in charge could not be asked to divulge these matters because of article 163 (3) of the Constitution.
We donor decide this question and leave it open.
Another point which was argued related to the privilege which the Home Secretary claimed on behalf of the State Government under article 22 (6) of the Constitution.
Govern ment disclosed certain facts in the grounds furnished to the detenu and claimed privilege regarding the rest of the facts in its possession.
In our opinion, the grounds supplied were sufficiently specific and they could form a proper basis for the ""satisfaction"" of the Government.
As regards the rest, Government has claimed privilege in the affidavit of the Home Secretary on the ground of public interest.
This raises further questions which we do not intend to examine as the respondent is not to be re arrested.
The order of release was, in our opinion, wrong, but in view of Government 's undertaking not to re arrest the re spondent, we direct that he be not re arrested in respect of the matters to which this appeal relates.
Order of High Court set aside.
","The material portion of an order of detention made under 3 of the preventive Detention Act 1950, ran as fol lows: 675 ""Whereas the Government of Bombay is satisfied with respect to the person known as J. N . . that with a view to preventing him from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order it is necessary to make the following order: Now, therefore, . . the Gov ernment of Bombay is pleased to direct that the said J.N. be detained.
By order of the Governor of Bombay (Sd.) V.T.D. Secretary to the Government of Bombay, Home Department"".
The High Court of Bombay held that the order was defec tive as it was not ""expressed to be in the name of the Governor"" within the meaning of article 166 (1) and was not accordingly protected by article 166 (2): Held, that the order was not defective merely because it stated that the Government of Bombay was satisfied and that the Government of Bombay was pleased to direct that J.N. be detained, and, though the addition of the words ""and in his name"" to the words ""By order of the Governor of Bombay"" would have placed the matter beyond controversy, the order was really one expressed to be taken in the name of the Governor of Bombay within article 166.
Held further, that, assuming that the order was defec tive it was open to the State Government to prove by other means that such an order has been validly made.
It is not absolutely necessary in every case to call the Minister in charge; if the Secretary or any other person has the requi site means of knowledge and his affidavit is believed, that will be enough.
Verification should invariably be modelled on the lines of O. XIX, r. 3, of the Civil Procedure Code, whether the Code applied in terms or not, and when the matter deposed to is not based on personal knowledge the sources of informa tion must be clearly disclosed.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BOSE J.
This petition and three others, namely peti tions Nos.
147, 155 and 157 of 1952, raise issues regarding the vires and applicability to these cases of section 3 of the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1952.
This judg ment is confined to those points and will govern these cases only in so far as they raise those points.
The remaining points which do not touch these issues will be dealt with by another Bench.
The only exception is a point raised in petition No. 155 of 1952 with which the other petitions are not concerned.
We will deal with that separately.
The present petition (No. 86 of 1952) was argued very ably and with commendable conciseness by the petitioner in person.
The fact that he has not been able to persuade us to his view is not due to any defect in his presentation of the case.
The petitioner was arrested on the 15th of November, 1951, and an order of detention under the Preventive Deten tion Act of 1950 was served on him the same day, and he was given the grounds of detention on the following day, the 16th.
His case was placed before an Advisory Board and on the 8th of February, 1952, the Bombay Government ""confirmed and continued"" the detention under section 11 (1) of the Preventive Detention Act of 1950.
This Act, as it originally stood, was due to expire on the 1st of April, 1951, but in that year an amending 686 Act was passed which, among other things, prolonged its life to the 1st of April, 1952.
The order of detention in this case was passed under the Act of 1950 as amended by the ,Act of 1951.
According to past decisions of this Court, the detention would have expired on the 1st of April, 1952, when the Act of 1950 as amended in 1951 would itself have expired.
But a fresh Act was passed in 1952 (Act XXXIV of 1952), the Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act, 1952.
The effect of this Act was to prolong the life of the Act of 1950 for a further six months, namely till the 1st of Octo ber, 1952.
The question is whether that Act also prolonged the detention and whether it had the vires to do so.
It was contended that the mere prolongation of the life of an Act does not, by reason of that alone, prolong the life of a detention which was due to expire when the Act under which it was made expired.
Therefore, as the Act under which the present detention was made was due to expire on the 1st of ApriL, 1952, the mere prolongation of its life by the amending Act did not affect a prolongation of the detention.
Accordingly, the petitioner should have been released on the 1st of April, 1952, and as there is no fresh order of detention he is entitled to immediate release.
We need not express any opinion on that point because there is present in the amending Act something more than a mere prolongation of the life of the old one.
There is section a which is in these terms: ""Validity and duration of detention in certain cases Every detention order confirmed under section 11 of the principal Act and in force immediately before the commence ment of this Act shall have effect as if it had been con firmed under the provisions of the principal Act as amended by this Act; and accordingly, where the period of detention is either not specified in such detention order or specified (by whatever form of words) to be for the duration or until the expiry of the principal Act or until the 31st day of March, 1952, such detention order shall continue to 687 remain in force for so long as the principal Act is in force, but without prejudice to the power of the appropriate Government to revoke or modify it at any time.
"" It will be noticed that the concluding part of this section states that the detention order shall remain in force ""for so long as the principal Act is in force."" Sec tion 2 of the amending Act defines the ""principal Act"" to mean the Act of 1950.
Therefore, it was argued, as the Act of 1950 was due to expire on the 1st of April, 1952, the present detention also came to an end on that date and so, in the absence of a fresh order of detention, the petition er 's detention after that date was illegal.
This argument, though ingenious, is fallacious.
The construction of an Act which has been amended is now governed by technical rules and we mast first be clear regarding the proper canons of construction.
The rule is that when a subsequent Act amends an earlier one in such a way as to incorporate itself, or a part of itself, into the earlier, then the earlier Act must thereafter be read and construed (except where that would lead to a repugnancy, inconsistency or absurdity) as if the altered words had been written into the earlier Act with pen and ink and the old words scored out so that thereafter there is no need to refer to the amending Act at all.
This is the rule in England:see Craies on Statute Law, 5th edition, page 207; it is the law in Amenca: see Crawford on Statutory Construc tion, page 110; and it is the law which the Privy Council applied to India in Keshoram Poddar vs Nundo Lal Mallick(1).
Bearing this in mind it will be seen that the Act of 1950 remains the Act of 1950 all the way through even with its subsequent amendments.
Therefore, the moment the Act of 1952 was passed and section 2 came into operation, the Act of 1950 meant the Act of 1950 as amended by section 2, that is to say, the Act of 1950 now due to expire on the 1st of October, 1952.
(1)(1927) 54 I.A. 152 at 155.
688 Turning now to section 3, whose vires is questioned, and examining it clause by clause we first get these words: ""Every detention order confirmed under section 11 of the principal Act and in force immediately before the commencement of this Act.
"" According to the rule of construction just examined, the words ""principal Act"" mean the Act of 1950 as amended by the Acts of 1951 and of 1952, 'that is to say, the Act of 1950 due to expire on the 1st of October, 1952.
Incidental ly, in the particular context it could not mean the Act of 1950 as it stood in 1950 because no order confirmed under it as it then stood could have been alive ""at the commencement of this Act"", namely on the 15th of March, 1952.
The section contin ues ""shall have effect as if it had been confirmed under the provisions of the principal Act as amended ' by this Act.
"" The underlined words ""as amended by this Act"" were relied on to show that wherever the words ""the principal Act"" were referred to they meant the unamended original Act of 1950, otherwise these words would have been unnecessary.
In our opinion, they were unnecessary in the sense that their absence would not have made any difference to the interpretation though it would have made the section harder to follow and understand.
We say that for this reason.
Without the underlined words the section paraphrased would read ""Every detention order confirmed under the original Act shall have effect as if confirmed under its provisions.
"" If this were to be read literally it would lead to an absurdity, for if the order is actually confirmed under the original unamended Act it would be pointless to introduce a fiction and say that the order shall be deemed to be con firmed under that Act as unamended.
But even apart from a strictly technical construction, the language of the section is accurate because, as we 689 have said, the rule is that an amended Act must be read as if the words of amendment had been written into the Act except where that would lead to an inconsistency, and this would be one of those cases unless the words are construed in a sensible and commonsense way.
The draughtsman there fore had either to leave the words as they were, with an apparent inconsistency, or make his meaning clear by adding the words he did.
But we do not think the addition made any difference to the result.
We now turn to the second half of section 3, that is to say, to the words following the semi co]on.
It is important to note here that this part is consequential on the first and merely explains the effect of the first half.
It is also relevant to note that it deals with four different kinds of orders, different, that is to say, in the form of the words used though in the end they all come to the same thing.
It deals with the following kinds of order: (1) an order in which the period of detention is not specified at all; in that event the detention would end at midnight on the night of the gist of March, 1952.
It is clear that in this context the words ""the principal Act"" cannot mean the Act expiring on the 1st of October, 1952, because it envisages an order made before the Act of 1952 was in being and so on the date of its making the order could only refer to the Act then in being; (2) an order in which the period is stated to be ""for the duration of the principal Act"", that is to say, till the 31st of March, 1952 , (3) an order in which the period is specified to be until the expiry of the principal Act, which again brings us back to the 31st of March, 1952, as the last day of deten tion; (4) an order in which the period is specified to be till the 31st of March, 1952.
In all these four cases the section says that the detention order shall ""continue to remain in force, for so long as the principal Act is in force"", that , is to say, till the 1st October, 1952.
690 That follows from the first part of the section because that is the meaning which the law directs shall be placed on these words unless the context otherwise directs and the context does not direct otherwise here.
This part of the section is only explanatory.
But we wish to found deeper than this.
It is the duty of Courts to give effect to the meaning of an Act when the meaning can be fairly gathered from the words used, that is to say, if one construction will lead to an absurdity while another will give effect to what common sense would show was obviously intended the construction which would defeat the ends of the Act must be rejected even if the same words used in the same section, and even the same sentence, have to be construed differently.
Indeed, the law goes so far as to require the Courts sometimes even to modify the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words if by doing so absurdity and inconsistency can be avoided.
See the speech of Lord Wens leydale in Grey vs Pearson (1) quoted with approval by the Privy Council in Narayana Swami vs Emperor (2); also Salmon vs Duncombe(3).
The rule is also set out in the text books: See Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes, 9th edition, page 236, and Craies on Statute Law, 5th edition, pages 89 to 93.
The meaning of section 3 is quite plain and only desperate hair splitting can reduce it to an absurdity.
Courts should not be astute to defeat the provisions of an Act whose meaning is, on the face of it, reasonably plain.
Of course, this does not mean that an Act, or any part of it, can be recast.
It must be possible to spell the meaning contended for out of the words actually used.
We hold that there is no difficulty of construction.
It was next argued that in any event the extended deten tion became a fresh detention (because of the Act of 1952) from the date the Act came into force, and reliance was placed upon the judgments of two of us, Mahajan and Das JJ.
in section Krishnan vs The State of Madras(4).
It is enough to say that was not the (1) r at 106.
(3) 11 App.
627 at 634.
(2) A.I.R. 1939 P.C. 47.
(4) ; at 635 and 640.
691 decision of the Court in that case, and further, that the two Judges who held it was a fresh detention nevertheless considered that a fresh order with its concomitant fresh grounds and a fresh reference to the Advisory Board were not required; therefore, either way the petitioner must fail.
Reference was made to the equality clause in article 14 of the Constitution but that argument is easily met because the classification which section 3 makes is reasonable.
In one class it places all those whose cases have already been considered by the Advisory Board and in the other those whose cases have yet to go before it; also the law is fair, or at any rate as fair as detention laws can be, despite this distinction because power is left to the appropriate Government to revoke or modify these orders, or any of them, at any time.
Substantially therefore there is no differenti ation.
Article 14 was considered at length in The Slate of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar (1), and according to the law laid down there, the Court must be satisfied on two points before it can strike at a law on the ground of unlawful discrimination.
It must be satis fied (1) that the law in fact discriminates and (2) that such discrimination is not permissible on the principle of a rational classification made for the purposes of the legislation.
The argument here was that section a discriminated against those detenus whose cases had been referred to the Advisory Board and whose detention was confirmed, on the strength of its report, under section 11 (1) before the amending Act of 1952 was passed.
The reason given was that these detentions are automatically extended up to the 1st of October, 1952, by section 3 without further reference to an Advisory Board, whereas in other cases, that is to say, in the case of those who were detained before the amending Act but whose cases had not been referred at the date it came into force, and in the case of those detained after the (1)[1952] S.c.R.284 692 amending Act, the Advisory Board is called into play and individual attention is given to each case with the result that many of those detentions might not be for as long as six months.
They might, for example, be only for one month or two.
It was urged that this was discrimination of a kind which cannot be supported by any principle of permissible classification because classification into the above catego ries has no reasonable relation to the objects of the legis lation, such as security of the State, maintenance of public order and so forth.
We are unable to accept this line of reasoning.
To say that section.
3 automatically extends the detention of persons in the petitioner 's position to the 1st of October, 1952, and stops there, is only to make a partial statement of the effect of section 3 because the extension is subject to the power of the appropriate Government to revoke or modify it at any time.
In other words, the automatic con tinuation of the detention till the 1st of October is not absolute and irrevocable but is made dependent on the power of the appropriate Government to revoke or modify it at its discretion under section 13 of the Act.
The State may or may not continue the detention for the whole of the extended period.
In both classes of cases the duration the deten tion within the overall limit of the life of the Act is left to the discretion of the State.
The only difference is that in the one class of cases the discretion is exercised after the period has been extended by the amending Act, in the other the appropriate Government fixes the period itself in its discretion and can again at its discretion revoke or modify it.
In both cases, the substance of the law is that the period of detention is left to the discretion of the State, and so there is no substantial discrimination.
It was argued that however fair this may look on paper, in practice there will be grave discrimination because, as a matter of fact, the State will not apply its mind in the majority of cases like the petitioner 'section That is an argument we cannot accept and no material Was placed before us t0 justify such a conclusion, 693 We turn now to the next point.
It was contended that sec tion 3 offends the Constitution because article 22 (4) and (7) do not envisage the direct intervention of Parliament in a whole batch of cases.
The protection guaranteed is that there shall be individual attention and consideration to each separate case by some duly specified and constituted authority.
In our opinion, this is not accurate.
Article 22 (4) guarantees that there shall be no preven tive detention for more than three months unless the law authorising it makes provision for an Advisory Board and the Board after considering each individual case separately reports that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention.
To that extent there must be individual consideration of each case, but once the report is made and is unfavourable to the detenu, then the detention can be for a longer period provided it does not exceed ""the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub clause (b) of clause (7).
"" Sub clause (b) of clause (7) empowers Parliament to prescribe ""the maximum period for which any person may in any class or . . . of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive deten tion.
"" Parliament is accordingly empowered to specify a class.
It has done so.
The class is all persons whose cases have already been considered by an Advisory Board.
It is empowered to prescribe a maximum period.
That also it has done.
The extended detention (that is to say, for more than three months) can then be ""under any law providing for preventive detention.
"" A law made by Parliament falls within these words.
Parliament is equally authorised to say who shall determine the period of detention, and as there is nothing in the Constitution to prevent it can itself exer cise the authority it is empowered to delegate to others.
Stress was laid on the words ""any person"" in subclause (b) of clause (7) and it was contended that this contem plates individual attention in each case.
But 694 if that is so, then it means that Parliament must itself direct the maximum period for each separate person falling within the class individually.
The words are, we think, reasonably plain and we hold that Parliament can prescribe the maximum for a class taken as a whole as it has done in section 3.
It was next argued that once the power given under clause (7) to fix a maximum period has been exercised the power exhausts itself and cannot be exercised again in respect of the same detention.
In our opinion, no such limitation is imposed upon Parliament by the Constitution.
Then it was said that section 3 stands on a footing different from section 12 of the amending Act of 1951 as it introduces the idea of potentially indefinite detention and accordingly is repugnant to the Constitution, and in any event is a fraud upon it.
In so far as this means that section a fixes no time limit, the contention is unsound because the section specifies the exact period of the deten tion, namely till the expiry of the Act of 1950, that is to say, till the 1st of October, 1952.
In so far as it means that Parliament is enabled to continue detentions indefi nitely by the expedient of periodic amendments in the Act of 1950, the answer is that Parliament has the power.
This was precisely the power exercised in the amending Act of 1951 and upheld by this Court in section Krishnan vs The State of Madras(1).
The present Act is no different from that in this respect.
So far, we have dealt with the facts in petition No. 86 of 1952.
The facts in the other three petitions naturally differ in their details but they all conform to the same general pattern so far as the points discussed above are concerned, so there is no need to discuss them individually.
We hold that section 3 of the amending Act of 1952 is intra vires and that the detentions are not bad on any of the grounds discussed above.
The rest of the points raised in each individual case are left open except for one point which (1) ; 695 arises in petition No. 155 of 1952.
That point is as fol lows.
The first ground of detention given to the petitioner in this case reads: ""Being the President of Jamat of Agris you have used your position as such to increase your influence over the residents of Uran Peta, have created a band of obedient and trusted associates, have inflicted heavy fines on villagers in Uran Peta who have disregarded your wishes and have imposed on them boycott or excommunication in cases of their refusal to pay the fines.
"" It was argued that at the very outset 'these allegations import nothing more than an exercise of functions such as the infliction of fines and excommunication which the peti tioner as head of the caste had authority to do.
They do not touch any of the matters covered by section 3 (1) (a) of the , under which the petitioner is detained.
For example, they do not touch the security of the State or the maintenance of public order or any of the other matters specified in section 3.
They are therefore irrelevant to the detention, and as it is impossible to say how far these irrelevant matters influenced the detention, the petitioner is entitled to release.
Reliance was placed upon certain observations of the Federal Court in Rex vs Basudev(1).
We think it unnecessary to examine this point because we do not think the ground is irrelevant nor do we agree that it means what the petitioner says.
In our opinion, the grounds of detention must be regarded as a whole and when that is done the relevance of the first ground becomes plain.
The gravamen of the charge against the petitioner is that he aimed at setting up a parallel government in the Uran Peta area and that in order to achieve that end he did various acts such as intimidating the workers in the salt pans with threats of murder, and his own workers with threats of death, unless they carried out his (1) at 651.
696 orders; and among the lesser instances given to illustrate the exercise of parallel governmental authority are the ones set out in the first ground, namely the infliction of fines with the sanction of excommunication and boycott to ensure their payment and due obedience to his orders.
This point has no force and is decided against the petitioner.
It will not be open to him to re agitate this afresh when his case is reheard on the remaining issues.
All the four cases will now be set down for hearing on the remaining points which arise in them.
As they do not involve constitutional issues they need not go before a Constitution Bench.

","An order directing the detention of the petitioner was made on the 15th of November, 1951, under the Preventive Detention Act of 1950 as amended by the Amending Act of 1951, which prolonged the duration of the Act of 1950 up to the 1st April, 1952.
The Preventive Detention (Amendment) Act of 1952 extended the duration of the Act of 1950 for a further period of six months, that is to say, until the 1st October, 1952.
Section 3 of the Act of 1952 provided further that detention orders confirmed under the principal Act and in force immediately before the commencement of the Act of 1952, shall, where the period of detention is not specified in the order, remain in force ""for so long as the principal Act (which was defined as the Act of 1950) was in force.
"" It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that his detention after 1st April, 1952, was illegal.
Held, (i)When a subsequent Act amends an earlier one in such a way as to incorporate itself or a part of itself into the earlier, then the earlier Act must thereafter be read and construed (except where that would lead to a repug nancy, inconsistency or absurdity) as if the altered words had been written into the earlier Act with pen and ink and the old words scored out so that there is no need to refer to the amending Act at all.
After the passing of the Act of 1952 the expressions ""the Act of 1950"" and ""the principal Act"" meant the Act of 1950 as amended by the Act of 1952, and the effect of section 3 of the Act of 1952 was that the detention of the petitioner would remain in force until the 1st October, 1952, without prejudice to the power of the Government to modify or revoke it; (ii) section 3 did not contravene article 14of the Constitu tion as there was a rational classification of the cases of detention orders in the section, and the period of detention was left in every case to the discretion of the State; (iii) the words ""any person"" in sub cl.

Appeal from the Judgment and Decree dated the 5th Sep tember, 1947, of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad (Waliullah and Sapru JJ.) in First Appeal No. 516 of 1942 arising out of Judgment and Decree dated the 3rd October, 1942, of the Court of the Civil Judge of Shahjahanpur in Original Suit No. 10 of 1941.

October 20.
The Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by BHAGWATI J.
This is an appeal by the heirs and legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff against the decree of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad allowing ' the appeal of the defendants against the decree passed by the Court of the Civil Judge of Shahjahanpur in favour of the plaintiff allowing the plaintiff 's claim in part.
One Kailashi Nath Kapoor, the plaintiff, was employed by the District Board of Shahjahanpur, the defendants, as their Secretary in the year 1924.
He 1124 was also entrusted in 1929 with the additional duties of doing assessment work for the defendants.
The work done by the plaintiff did not find favour with some members of the Board and on the 9th November, 1939, six members of the Board tabled a resolution asking the Chairman to convene a special meeting of the Board to consider a resolution for the dismissal of the plaintiff.
A special meeting of the Board was convened on the 17th December, 1939.
Twelve charges were framed against the plaintiff and he was re quired to furnish his answers to them.
A special meeting of the Board was thereafter convened on the 20th January, 1940.
The resolution for the dismissal of the plaintiff was on the agenda but the meeting had to be adjourned for want of quorum to the 29th January, 1940.
At the adjourned meeting of the 29th January, 1940, twenty five out of the twentyseven members of the Board were present.
The charges against the plaintiff were gone into and eleven out of the twelve charges were held proved.
Two resolutions were consequently passed by the Board at this meeting, one being a resolution for his dismissal, and the other being a reso lution for his suspension till the matter of his dismissal was decided under section 71 of the U.P. District Boards Act, X of 1922, on an appeal if any preferred by the plain tiff to the Government.
The plaintiff preferred an appeal to the Government against the resolution for his dismissal and this appeal was dismissed by the Government on the 19th December, 1940.
The plaintiff thereafter commenced in the Court of the Civil Judge at Shahjahanpur the suit out of which this appeal arises against the defendants for a declaration that the two resolutions passed by the Board on the 29th January, 1940, were illegal and ullra vires of the Board and that he continued to be the Secretary and Assessing Officer of the Board, for an injunction restraining the Board from prevent ing him from discharging his duties as such Secretary and Assessing Officer, for arrears of his salary with interest and contribution to his provident Fund and in the alterna tive 1125 for damages and compensation for illegal dismissal and suspension and for costs.
The defendants contended that the said resolutions were valid and binding on the plaintiff and that the plaintiff was not entitled to any relief as claimed.
The learned trial judge held that the two resolutions passed by the Board on the 29th January, 1940, were properly passed and that there was no irregularity in the procedure.
He held that the resolution for dismissal of the plaintiff was valid and binding on the plaintiff but the resolution for suspension was not legal.
In the result he decreed the plaintiff 's claim for arrears of salary, and the contribu tion towards the provident fund against the defendants for the period of suspension and awarded to the plaintiff a sum of Rs. 6,629 4 0 with proportionate costs, the rest of the plaintiff 's claim was dismissed.
The defendants appealed to the High Court against this decree and the plaintiff filed cross objections in regard to his claim which had been disallowed.
The plaintiff died during the pendency of the appeal and his heirs and legal representatives, being his widow and his four sons, were brought on the record.
The High Court concurred with the trial court in the finding that there was no irregularity, impropriety or illegality in the procedure followed and the steps taken before the meet ing or at the meeting of the Board when the two resolutions were considered and passed.
It however disagreed with the conclusion reached by the trial Court that the resolution for suspension was ultra vires the Board.
It held that the resolution for suspension also was valid and binding on the plaintiff and thus dismissed the plaintiff 's suit with costs throughout.
The crossobjections of the plaintiff were of course dismissed with costs.
The heirs and legal repre sentatives of the plaintiff obtained leave to appeal to the Federal Court against this decision of the High Court and the appeal was admitted on the 5th November, 1948.
Both the Courts below having found that there was no irregularity, impropriety or illegality in the procedure followed and the steps taken when the two 1126 resolutions in question were passed by the Board the only question that survived for consideration by this Court was whether the resolution for suspension of the plaintiff was valid and binding on the plaintiff or in other words whether it was competent to the Board to pass the resolution for the suspension of the plaintiff after it had passed the resolu tion for his dismissal under section 71 of the Act.
Section 71 of the Act provides for the dismissal and punishment of the secretary: ""A board may by special resolution punish or dismiss its secretary: Provided, firstly, that such resolution is passed by a vote of not less than two thirds of the total number of members of the board for the time being: Provided, secondly, that the secretary of a board shall have a right of appeal to the State Government against such resolution within one month from the date of the communica tion of the resolution to him, and that the resolution shall not take effect until the period of one month has expired or until the State Government have passed orders on any appeal preferred by him.
"" It will be relevant at this stage to note that this section 71 was amended by U.P. Act I of 1933.
Section 71 as it originally stood ran thus: ""A board may by special resolution punish or dismiss its secretary provided, (a) that such a resolution is passed by a vote of not less than two thirds of the total number of members of the board for the time being, or (b) that it is passed by a vote of not less than one half of the total number of members.
and is ' sanctioned by the Local Government ' .
It may be noted that in the original section 71 provi sion was made for the sanction of the Local Government in certain cases.
No such provision is to be found in the amended section 71 of the Act.
The resolution according to the amended section 71 is to be passed by a vote of not less than two thirds of the 1127 total number of members of the Board and such a resolution is not to take effect until the period of one month has expired within which the secretary can exercise his right of appeal or until the Government have passed orders on the appeal if any preferred by him.
There is no question of the sanction of the Local Government to any resolution for dismissal the only provision being that the resolution is to take effect after the expiration of the period of one month or after the Government have passed orders on the appeal if any preferred by the secretary within that period of one month.
Once that period of one month expires without the secretary preferring any appeal against the resolution of the Board or the Government passes final orders on the appeal preferred by him, the resolution takes effect without anything more in the nature of a sanction by the Government.
The power of suspension is conferred and regulated in section 90 of the Act : ""(1) Suspension may be of two kinds: (a) suspension as a punishment, and (b) suspension pending inquiry or orders.
(2) Where a general power to punish is conferred by this Act, it shall be deemed to include a power to suspend as a punishment for a period not exceeding three months.
(3) Where a power of dismissal, whether subject to the sanction of any other authority or not, is conferred by this Act, it shall be deemed to include a power to suspend any person against whom the power of dismissal might be exer cised, pending enquiry into his conduct or pending the orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary for his dismissal.
(4) Where suspension is ordered pending inquiry or or ders, and the officer suspended is ultimately restored, it shall be at the discretion of the authority ordering his suspension whether he shall get any, and, if so what, allow ance during the period of suspension; but in the absence of any order to the contrary he shall be 1128 entitled to the full remuneration which he would have re ceived but for such suspension.
"" The suspension which has been thus provided for is of two categories, (1) suspension as a punishment and (2) suspension pending enquiry or orders.
In the case of a suspension falling within the latter category the only power of suspension which is provided is that of suspending any person against whom the power of dismissal might be exer cised pending enquiry into his conduct or pending the orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary for his dis missal.
The power of suspension pending enquiry into the conduct of the person can only be exercised if an enquiry against him has been started and before any order is made for his dismissal as a result of such enquiry.
The power of suspension pending the orders of the authority whose sanc tion is necessary for his dismissal can similarly be exer cised provided the order of dismissal is made but that dismissal could be effective only after the orders of the authority whose sanction is needed for effectuating the same.
The section does not provide for any other case where as on the facts before us the order of dismissal does not require the sanction of any authority but has got to await either the expiry of a particular period after such order of dismissal has been made or the result of an appeal which may be preferred to the Government within the period prescribed in that behalf.
A decision of an authority to which an appeal is provided is not the same thing as a sanction by the authority.
A perusal of sub section (4) of section 90 makes this position quite clear.
The authority ordering the suspension is vested with the discretion to determine whether the officer suspended would get any or if so what allowance during the period of suspension where suspension is ordered pending enquiry or orders and the officer sus pended is ultimately restored.
There is no provision for any allowance where the officer having been dismissed is also suspended for the period which has of necessity to expire before his appeal is time barred or before the Gov ernment passes 1129 orders on the appeal if any preferred by him within the prescribed period.
Such a case is not at all provided for in sub section 4 of section 90 and the officer so suspended would be without any remedy whatever and would not be able to get any allowance at all from the authority ordering his suspension during such period of suspension.
It is necessary to bear in mind the provisions of these sections 71 and 90 of the Act in order to determine whether it was competent to the Board to pass a resolution for suspension of the plaintiff after it had passed the resolu tion for his dismissal on the 29th January, 1940.
On a construction of these sections 71 and 90 of the Act the trial Court came to the conclusion that the provisions of section 90 of the Act were exhaustive, that no other category of suspension apart from those specified could be ordered and that therefore the resolution for suspension of the plaintiff was ultra rites the Board.
The High Court in appeal realised the difficulty of the position.
It came to the conclusion that section 90 as it stood was in close conformity with the provisions of the old section 71 of the Act which provided for the resolution for dismissal passed by a vote of not less than one half of the total number of members being required to be sanctioned by the Local Govern ment.
The sanction was expressly provided there.
But when that section came to be amended by the U.P. Act I of 1933, the provision for sanction was deleted and it provided for the resolu tion not taking effect until the period of one month had expired within which the secretary could exercise his right of appeal or until the Government had passed orders on the appeal ii any preferred by him.
When this amendment was made in the old section 71 of the Act the provision made in section 90 in regard to the power of suspension was lost sight of and no corresponding amendment was made in section 90, sub section (1)(b), sub section (3) or subsection (4) which would bring the provisions of 145 1130 section 90 in conformity with the amended section 71 of the Act.
The High Court was therefore at pains to place what it called a liberal construction on the provisions of section 71 and section 90 of the Act trying to read in the power of suspension provided in section 90 also a power of suspension during the period that the secretary preferred an appeal to the Government against the order of his dismissal and the Government passed orders on such appeal.
Apart from placing this so called liberal construction on the expression ""the orders of any authority whose sanc tion is necesssary"" in section 90 subsection 3, the High Court also brought to its aid the provisions of Section 16 of the U.P. General Clauses Act of 1904 which provides that ""unless a different intention appears the authority having power to make the appointment shall also have power to suspend or dismiss any person appointed by it in exercise of that power "".
It came to the conclusion that nothing in the terms of section 71 or section 90 of the Act controlled or negatived an intention to sustain the general power of suspension, i.e. suspension pending orders on an appeal.
The High Court thus justified the resolution for the suspen sion of the plaintiff passed by the Board on the 29th January, 1940.
We are afraid we cannot agree with this line of reason ing adopted by the High Court.
The defendants were a Board created by statute and were invested with powers which of necessity had to be found within the four corners of the statute itself.
The powers of dismissal and suspension given to the Board are defined and circumscribed by the provisions of sections 71 and 90 of the Act and have to be culled out from the express provisions of those sections.
When express powers have been given to the Board under the terms of these sections it would not be legitimate to have resort to general or implied powers under the law of master and servant or under section 16 of the U.P. General Clauses Act.
Even under the terms of section 16 of that Act, the powers which are vested 1131 in the authority to suspend or dismiss any person appointed are to be operative only ""unless a different intention appears"" and such different intention is to be found in the enactment of sections 71 and 90 of the Act which codify the powers of dismissal and suspension vested in the Board.
It would be an unwarranted extension of the powers of suspen sion vested in the Board to read, as the High Court pur ported to do, the power of suspension of the type in ques tion into the words ""the orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary"".
It was unfortunate that when the Legislature came to amend the old section 71 of the Act it forgot to amend section90 in conformity with the amendment of section 71.
But this lacuna cannot be supplied by any such liberal construction as the High Court sought to put upon the expression ""orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary"".
No doubt it is the duty of the court to try to harmonise the various provisions of an Act passed by the Legislature.
But it is certainly not the duty of the Court to stretch the words used by the Legislature to fill in gaps or omissions in the provisions of an Act.
Reading the present, section 71 of the Act along with section 90 of the Act we are of the opinion that the power of suspension of the nature purported to be exercised by the Board in the case before us was not the power of suspension contemplated in section 90 sub section (3) of the Act.
If the plaintiff allowed the period of one month to expire without preferring an appeal against the resolution to the Government or if the Government passed orders dismissing his appeal, if any, the resolution for ' his dismissal would become effective without any sanction of the Government.
The words used therefore in section 90, sub section (3) ""pending the orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary for his dismissal"" are inappropriate to the present facts and could not cover the case of a suspension of the nature which was resorted to by the Board on the 29th January, 1940.
We are therefore of the view that the resolution for suspension which was 1132 passed on the 29th January, 1940, was ultra vires the powers of the Board.
We have accordingly come to the conclusion that the decision reached by the High Court that the resolution for suspension which was passed by the Board on the 29th Janu ary, 1940, was valid and binding on the ""plaintiff was erroneous and that the conclusion reached by the trial Court was correct.
The learned Solicitor General appearing for the defendants has however informed us that the sum of Rs. 6,629 4 0 and the proportionate costs which were awarded by the trial Court to the plaintiff have already been paid to the plaintiff.
Nothing therefore remains to be recovered by the heirs and legal representatives of the plaintiff even on the basis that the decree of the trial Court is restored as a result of this judgment of ours.
The only thing which therefore survives is the question of the costs of this appeal.
The trial Court had already awarded to the plaintiff proportionate costs.
The High Court in reversing the judgment of the trial Court dismissed the plaintiff 's suit with costs throughout including the costs of the cross objections which were filed by the plain tiff.
The heirs and legal representatives of the plaintiff filed the present appeal in regard to the whole claim of the plaintiff as laid in the plaint.
That claim could not be sustained before us by the heirs and legal representatives of the plaintiff and they only succeeded before us in regard to the claim of the plaintiff which had been allowed by the trial Court.
If an order for proportionate costs of this appeal were made it would certainly work to the prejudice of the heirs and legal representatives of the plaintiff.
We are not disturbing the order which had been made by the High Court in regard to the costs of the appeal before it.
No time was taken up before us in arguing the appeal on other points except the one in regard to the resolution for the suspension of the plaintiff being ultra rites and we think that under the circumstances of the case the proper order to pass in regard to the costs of this appeal before us should be that each party should bear its own costs.
1133 The only order which we need pass in this appeal before us under the circumstances is that the appeal is allowed, the decree of the trial court is restored, and each party do bear and pay its own costs of this appeal.
Appeal allowed.
","Section 71 of the U.P. District Boards Act, 1922, as amended in 1933 provided that a resolution of the Board for the dismissal of its secretary shall not take effect until the period of one month has expired or until the State Government have passed orders on any appeal preferred by him.
A District Board passed a resolution for dismissal of its secretary and also for his suspension till the matter of his dismissal was decided under section 71 of the Act on an appeal if any preferred by the secretary: Held, that under section 90 of the Act a secretary could be suspended only as a punishment or pending inquiry or 1123 pending the orders of any authority whose sanction is neces sary for his dismissal.
The words ""pending the orders of any authority whose sanction is necessary for his dismissal"" could not appropriately cover the case of a suspension like the present one and the resolution for suspension was 'therefore ultra vires.
Held further, that since the Board was created by stat ute, and its powers of dismissal and suspension are defined and circumscribed by sections 71 and 90 of the Act it would not be legitimate to have resort to general or implied powers under the law of master and servant or under section 16 of the U.P. General Clauses Act;and even under section 16 of that Act powers which are vested in an authority to suspend or dismiss any person appointed, are to be operative only ""unless a different intention appears"" and such a different intention is to be found in sections 71 and 90 of the Act which codify the powers of dismissal and suspension vested in the Board.

96.txt,"iminal Appeal No. 41 of 1952.
Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated the 3rd October,, 1951, of the High Court of Judicature for the State of Punjab at Simla (Bhandari and Soni JJ in Criminal Appeal No. 86 of 1961, arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the, 31st January, 1951, of the Court of the Sessions Judge, Ambala, in Case No. 23 of '1950 and Trial No. 2 of 1951, 96 Jai GopalSethi (B. L. Kohli with him) for the Appellant.
H.S. Gujral, for the respondent.
Bhagat Singh Chawla, for the Caveator.
October 22.
The judgment 0f the Court was delivered by MAHAJAN J. Palvinder Kaur,was tried for offences under sections 302 and 201, Indian Penal Code, in connection with the murder of her husband, Jaspal Singh.
She was convicted by the Sessions Judge under section, 302 and sentenced to transportation for life.
No verdict was recorded regarding the charge under section 201, Indian Penal Code.
appeal to the High Court she was acquitted of the charge of murder, but was convicted under section 201, Indian Penal Code, and sentenced to seven years ' rigorous Imprisonment.
Her appeal by special leave is now before us.
Jaspal Singh, deceased, was the son of the Chief of Bhareli (Punjab).
He was married to Palvinder Kaur a few years ago and they had two children.
The. husband and wife were living together in Bhareli house, Ambala.
It is said that Jaspal 's relations with his father and grandfather, were not very cordial and the two elders thought that Palvinder Kaur was responsible, for this.
It is also said that Jaspal lived the allowance he got from his father and supplemented his income by selling milk and eggs and by doing some odd jobs.
Mohinderpal Singh (a fugitive from justice) who is related to the appellant and was employed as a storekeeper in Baldevnagar Camp, Ambala, used occasionally to reside in Bhareli house.
It is suggested that he had started a liaison with Palvinder.
The prosecution case is that Sardar Jaspal was administered potassium cyanide poison by the appellant and Mohinderpal the afternoon of the 6th February, 1950.
The dead body was then put into a large trunk and kept in one of the rooms in the house in Ambala city.
About ten days later i.e., the 97 16th February, 1950, Mohinderpal during the absence of the appellant, removed the trunk from the house in a jeep when he came there with Amrik Singh and Kartar Singh (P. Ws.), two watermen of the Baldevnagar Camp.
The trunk was then taken to Baldevnagar Camp and was kept in a store room there.
Three days later, the 19th February, 1950, Mohinderpal accompanied by Palvinder and a domestic servant, Trilok Chand (P. W. 27), took the trunk a few miles the ' road leading to Rajpura, got to a katcha road and in the vicinity of village Chhat took the jeep to a well a mound and threw, the box into it.
The jeep was taken to a gurdwara where it was washed.
After the disappearance of the deceased, his father made enquiries from Mohinderpal regarding the ' whereabouts of his missing son.
Mohinderpal made various false statements to him.
the 8th March, 1950, the father advertised in the ""Daily Milap"" begging his son to return home as soon as possible as the condition of his wife and children and parents had become miserable owing to his absence.
On the 10th March, 1950, i.e., a, month and ten days after the alleged murder and 19 days after the trunk was thrown into the well, obnoxious smell was coming out of the well, and the matter being reported to the lambardars of ' village Chhat, the trunk was taken out.
The matter was reported to the police and Sardar Banta Singh, Sub Inspector of Police, the 11th March arrived at the scene and prepared the inquest report and sent for the doctor.
The postmortem examination was performed the spot the next day.
No photograph of the body was taken and it was allowed to be cremated.
After more than two and a half months, the 28th April, 1950 th first information report was lodged against the appellant and Mohinderpal and the26th June a challan was presented in the court of the committing magistrate Mohinderpal was not traceable and the case Was started against the appellant alone, 98 There is no direct evidence to establish that the appellant or Mohinderpal or both of them administered potassium cyanide to Jaspal and the evidence regarding the murder is purely circumstantial.
The learned Sessions Judge took the view that the circumstantial evidence in the case was incompatible with the innocence of the accused, and held that the case against the appellant was proved beyond any reasonable doubt.
The High Court appeal arrived at a different conclusion.
It held that though the body found from the well was not capable of identification, the clothes recovered from the trunk and found the body proved that it was the body of Jaspal.
It further held that the cause of death could not be ascertained from the medical evidence given in the case.
The evidence the question of the identity of the dead body consisted of the statement of constable Lachhman 'Singh, of the clothes and other ' articles recovered from inside the trunk and of an alleged confession of the accused.
As regards the first piece of evidence the High Court expressed the following opinion: ""There is in our opinion considerable force in the contention that not only are foot constable Lachhman Singh and Assistant Sub Inspector Banta Singh testifying to the facts which are false to their knowledge but that the prosecution are responsible for deliberately introducing a false witness and for asking the other witnesses to support the story narrated by Lachhman Singh that he identified the body to be that of Jaspal Singh the 11th March and communicate the information to the father of the deceased the following day.) ' As regards the extra judicial confessions alleged to.
have been made to Sardar Rup Singh and Sardar Balwant Singh, father and grandfather of the deceased, they were held inadmissible and unreliable.
The confession made by Palvinder to the magistrate, the 15th April, 1950, was however used in evidence against her the following reasoning: ""It is true that strictly speaking exculpatory statements in which the prisoner denies her guilt cannot 99 be regarded as confessions, but these statements are often used as circumstantial evidence of guilty consciousness by showing them to be false and fabricated.
"" It was also found that though Palvinder might have desired to continue her illicit intrigue with Mohinderpal she may not have desired to sacrifice her wealth and position at the altar of love.
She may have had ' a motive to kill her husband but a stronger motive to preserve her own position as the wife of a prospective chief of Bhareli and that in this situation it was by no means impossible that the murder was committed by Mohinderpal alone without the consent and knowledge of Palvinder, and that though a strong suspicion attached to Palvinder, it was impossible to state with confidence that poison was administered by her.
Therefore it was not possible to convict her under section 302, Indian Penal Code.
Concerning the charge under section 201, Indian Penal Code, the High Court held that the most important piece of evidence in support of the charge was the confession which Palvinder made the 15th April, 1950, and this confession, though retracted, was corroborated this point by independent evidence and established the charge.
The judgment of the High Court was impugned before us a large number of grounds.
Inter alia, it was contended that in examining Palvinder Kaur at great length the High Court contravened the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the Full Bench decision of the High Court in Dhara Singh 's case(1) was wrong in law, that the alleged confession of the appellant being an.
exculpatory statement, the same was inadmissible in evidence and could not be used as evidence against her, that it had been contradicted in most material particulars by the prosecution evidence itself and was false and that in any case it could not be used piecemeal; that the offences under sections 302/34 and 201, Indian Penal Code, being distinct offences committed at two different times and being (1) (I952) , 100 separate transactions, the appellant having been convicted of the offence under section 302, Indian Penal Code, only by the Session Judge, the High Court had no jurisdiction when acquitting her of that offence to, convict her under section 201 of the same Code; that the statements of Mohinderpal to 'various witnesses land his conduct were not relevant against the appellant; that Karamchand and Mst.
Lachhmi were in the nature of accomplices and the High Court erred in relying their testimony without any corrobora tion; that the High Court having disbelieved eight of the witnesses of the prosecution and having held that they were falsely introduced into the case, the investigation being extremely belated and the story having been developed at different stages, the High Court should not have relied the same; and lastly that the pieces of circumstantial evidence proved against the appellant were consistent with several innocent explanations and the High Court therefore erred in relying them without excluding those possi bilities.
The decision of the appeal, in our view, lies within a very narrow compass and it is not necessary to pronounce all the points that were argued before us.
In our judgment, there is no evidence 'to establish affirmatively that the death of Jaspal was caused by potassium cyanide and that being so, the charge under section 201, Indian Penal Code, must also fail. ' The High Court in reaching a contrary conclusion not only acted suspicions and conjectures but inadmissible evidence.
, The circumstances in which Jaspal died will for ever remain shrouded in mystery and the material placed the record it is not possible to unravel them.
It may well be that he was murdered by Mohinderpal without the knowledge or consent of Palvinder and the incident took place at Baldevnagar Camp and not at the house and that Mohinderpal alone disposed of the dead body and that the confession of Palvinder is wholly false and the advertisement issued in Milap correctly reflected the facts 101 so far as she was concerned.
The evidence led by the prosecution, however, is of such a character that no, reliance can be placed it and no affirmative conclusions can be drawn from it.
The remarks of the Sessions Judge; that the consequences had definitely revealed that justice could not always be procured by wealth and other worldly resources and that the case would perhaps go down in history as one of the most sensational cases because of the parties involved and the gruesome way""in which the murder was committed, disclose a frame of mind not necessarily judicial.
It was unnecessary to introduce sentimentalism in a judicial decision.
The High Court was not able to reach a positive conclusion that Palvinder was responsible for the murder of her husband.
Whether Jaspal committed suicide or died of poison taken under a mistake or whether poison was administared to him by the appellant or by Mohinderpal or by both of them are questions the answers to which have been left very vague and indefinite by the circumstantial evidence in the case.
In view of the situation of the parties and the belated investigation of the case and the sensation it created, it was absolutely necessary for the courts below to safeguard them.
selves against the danger of basing their conclusions suspicions howsoever strong.
Seems to us that the trial court, &Ad to a certain extent the High Court, fell into the same error against which warning was given by Baron Alderson in Beg.
vs Hodge(1), where he said as follows: The mind was apt to take a pleasure in adapting circumstances to one another, and even in straining them a little, if need be, to force them to form parts of one connected whole; and the more ingenious the mind of the individual, the more likely was it, considering such matters, to overreach and mislead itself, to supply some little link that is wanting, to take for granted some fact consistent with its previous theories and necessary to render them complete.
"" (1) 102 We had recently occasion to emphasize this point in Nargundkar vs The State of Madhya Pradesh(1).
In order to establish the charge under section 201, Indian Penal Code, it is essential to prove that an offence has been committed mere suspicion that it has been committed is not sufficient,that the accused knew or had reason to believe that such offence had been committed and with the requisite knowledge and with the intent to screen the offender from legal punishment causes the evidence thereof to disappear or gives false information respecting such offences knowing or having reason to believe the same to be false.
It was essential in these circumstances for the prosecution to establish affirmatively that the death of Jaspal was caused by the administration of potassium cyanide by some person (the appellant having been acquitted of this charge) and that she had reason to believe that it was so caused and with that knowledge she took part in the concealment and 'disposal of the dead body.
There is no evidence whatsoever this point.
The following facts, that Jaspal died, that his body was found in a trunk and was discovered from a well and that the appellant took part in the disposal of the body do not establish the cause of his death or the manner and circumstances in which it came about.
As already stated, there is no direct evidence to prove that potassium cyanide was administered to him by any person.
The best evidence this question would have been that of the doctor who performed the postmortem examination.
That evidence does not prove that Jaspal died as a result of administration of potassium cyanide.
the other hand, the doctor was of the opinion that there were no positive postmortem signs which could suggest poisoning.
He stated that potassium cyanide being corrosive poison, would produce hypermia, softening and ulceration of the gastro intestinal track and that in this case he did not notice any such signs.
He further said that potassium cyanide corrodes the lips and the mouth, and none of these signs was the body.
This evidence (1) [1952] S.C.R, 1091 103 therefore instead of proving that death was caused by administration of potassium cyanide, to the extent it.
goes, negatives that fact.
The High Court placed reliance the confession of Palvinder made the 15th April, 1950, to bold this fact proved.
The confession is in these terms: ""My husband Jaspal Singh was fond of hunting as well as of photography.
From hunting whatever skins (khalls) he brought home he became fond of colouring them.
He also began to do the work of washing of photos out of eagerness.
One day in December, 1949, Jaspal Singh said to my cousin (Tay 's son) Mohinderpal Singh to, get him material for washing photos.
He(Mohinderpal Singh) said to Harnam Singh, who is head clerk in Baldevnagar Camp, to bring the same from,the Cantt.
Harnam Singh went to the Cantt.
and return said that the material for washing photos could be had only by a responsible Government official.
He told so to Mohinderpat Singh, who said that Harnam Singh should take his name and get the medicine.
Thereupon Harnam Singh went to the Cantt.
and brought the medicine.
I kept this medicine.
As the medicine wassticking to the paper I put it in water in a small bottle and kept it in the almirah.
In those days my husband was in Ambala and I lived with him in the kothi in the city.
He went for hunting for 2 3 days and there he developed abdominal trouble and began to purge.
He sent for medicine 3 4 days from Dr. Sohan Singh.
One day I placed his medicine bottle in the almirah where medicine, for washing photos had been placed.
I was sitting outside and Jaspal Singh enquired from me where his medicine, was.
I told him that it was in the almirah.
By mistake he took that medicine which was meant for washing photos.
At that time, he fell down and my little son was standing by his side.
He said 'Mama, Papa had fallen '.
I went inside and saw, that he was in agony and in short time be expired.
Thereafter I went to Mohinderpal Singh 104 and told him all that had happened.
He said that father of Jaspal Singh had arrived and that he should be 'intimated.
But I did not tell him, because his connections were not good with his son and myself.
Out of fear I placed his corpse in a box and Mohinderpal Singh helped me in doing so.
For 4 5 days the box remained in my kothi.
Thereafter I said to Mohinderpal Singh that if he did not help me I would die.
, He got removed that box from my kothi with the help of my servants and placing the same in his jeep went to his store in Baldevnagar Camp and kept the same there.
That box remained there for 8 10 days.
Thereafter one day I went to the camp and from there got placed the trunk in the jeep and going with Mohinderpal Singh I threw the same in a well near Chhat Banur.
I do not remember the date when Jaspal Singh took the medicine by mistake.
It was perhaps in January, 1950.
"" The statement read as a whole is of an exculpatory character.
It does not suggest or prove the commission of any offence under the Indian Penal Code by any one.
It not only exculpates her from the commission of an offence but also exculpates Mohinderpal.
It states that the death of Jaspal was accidental.
The statement does not amount to a confession and is thus inadmissible in evidence.
It was observed by their Lordships of the Privy Council in Narayanaswami vs Emperor(1) that the word ""confession"" as used in the Evidence Act cannot be construed as meaning a statement by an accused suggesting the inference that he committed the crime.
A confession must either admit in terms the offence, or at any rate substantially all the 'facts which constitute the offence.
An admission of a gravely incriminating fact, even a conclusively, incriminating fact, is not of itself a confession.
A statement that contains self exculpatory matter 'cannot amount to a confession, if the exculpatory statement is of some fact, which if true, would negative the offence alleged to be confessed.
In this view of the law the High Court (1) (1939) 66 I.A. 66; A.I.R. 1939 P.C. 47: 105 was in error in treating the statement of Palvinder as the most important piece of evidence in support of the charge under section 201, Indian Penal ' Code.
The learned Judges in one part of their judgment observed that strictly speaking exculpatory statements in which the prisoner denies her guilt cannot be regarded as confessions, but went to say that such statements are often used as circumstantial evidence of guilty consciousness by showing them to be false and fabricated.
With great respect we have not been able,to follow the meaning of these observations and the learned counsel appearing at the Bar for the prosecution was unable to explain what these words exactly indicated.
The statement not being a confession and being of an exculpatory nature in which the guilt had been denied by the prisoner, it could not be used as evidence in the case to prove her guilt.
Not only was the High Court in error in treating the alleged confession of Palvinder as evidence in the case but it was further in error in accepting a part of it after finding that the rest of it was false.
It said that the statement that the deceased took poison by mistake should be ruled out of consideration for the simple reason that if the deceased had taken poison by mistake the conduct of the parties would have been completely different, and that she would have then run to his side and raised a hue and cry and would have sent immediately for medical aid, that it was incredible that if the deceased had taken poison by mistake, his wife Would have,stood idly by and allowed him to die.
The court thus accepted the inculpatory part of that statement and rejected the exculpatory part.
In doing so it contravened the well accepted rule regarding the use of confession and admission that these must either be accepted as a whole or rejected as a whole and that the court is not competent to accept only the inculpatory part while rejecting the exculpatory part as inherently incredible.
Reference in this connection may be made to the observations of the Full Bench of the Allahabad 106 High Court in Emperor vs Balmakund(1), with which observations we fully concur.
The confession there comprised of two elements, (a) an account of how the accused killed the women, and (b) an account of his reasons for doing so, the former element being inculpatory and the latter exculpatory and the question referred to the Full Bench was: Can the court if it is of opinion that the inculpatory part commends belief and the exculpatory part is inherently incredible, act upon the former and refuse to act upon the latter ? The answer to the reference was that where there is no other evidence to show affirmatively that any portion of the exculpatory element in the confession is false, the court must accept or reject the confession as a whole and cannot accept only the inculpatory element while rejecting the exculpatory element as inherently incredible.
The alleged confession of Palvinder is wholly of an ' exculpatory nature and does not admit the commission, of any crime whatsoever.
The suspicious circumstances from which an inference of guilt would be drawn were contained in that part of the statement which concerned the disposal of the dead body.
This part of the statement could not be used as evidence by holding that the first part which was of an exculpatory character was false when there was no evidence to prove that it was so, and the only material which it could be so hold was the conduct mentioned in the latter part of the same statement and stated to be inconsistent with the earlier part of the confession.
The result therefore is that no use can be made of the statement made by Palvinder and contained in the alleged confession and which the High Court thought was the most important piece of evidence in the case to prove that the death of Jaspal was caused by poisoning or as a result of an offence having been committed.
Once this confession is excluded altogether, there remains no evidence for holding that Jaspal died as a result of the administration of potas sium cyanide.
(1) (193o) I.L.R. 52 All.
107 The circumstantial evidence referred to by the High Court which according to it tends to establish that Jaspal did not die a natural death is of the ' following nature: That Palvinder and Mohinderpal had a motive to get rid of the deceased as she was carrying with Mohinderpal.
The motive, even if proved in the case, cannot prove the circumstances under which Jaspal died or the cause which resulted in his death.
That Mohinderpal was proved to be in possession of a quantity of potassium cyanide and was in a position to administer it to the deceased is a cir cumstance of a neutral character.
Mere possession of potassium cyanide by Mohinderpal without its being traced in the body of Jaspal cannot establish that his death was caused by this deadly poison.
In any case, the circumstance is not of a character which is wholly incompatible with the innocence of the appellant.
The other evidence referred to by the High Court as corroborating the latter part of Palvinder 's alleged confession in the view of the case that we have taken does not require any discussion because if the confession is inadmissible, no question of corroborating it arises.
Mr. Sethi argued that the statements contained in the alleged confession are contradicted rather than corroborated by the evidence led by the prosecution and that the confession is proved to be untrue.
It is unnecessary to discuss this matter in the view that we have taken of the case.
The result, therefore, is that we are constrained to hold that there is no material, direct or indirect, for the finding reached by the High Court that the death of Jaspal wascaused by the administration of potassium cyanide.
If we believe the defence version his death was the result of an accident.
If that version is disbelieved,then there is no proof as to the cause of his death.
The method and manner in which the dead body of Jaspal was dealt with and disposed of raise some suspicion but from these, facts a positive conclusion cannot be reached that he died an unnatural death necessarily, Cases are not unknown 108 where death is accidental and the accused has acted in a peculiar manner regarding the disposal of the dead body for reasons best known to himself.
One of them might well be that he was afraid of a false case being started against him.
Life and liberty of persons cannot be put in jeopardy mere suspicions, howsoever strong, and they can only be deprived of these the basis of definite proof.
In this case, as found by the High Court, not only were the Sub Inspector of police and police constables and other witnesses guilty of telling deliberate lies but the prosecution was blameworthy in introducing witnesses in the case to support their lies and that being so, we feel that it would be unsafe to convict the appellant the material that is left after eliminating the perjured,, false and inadmissible evidence.
For the reasons given above we allow this appeal, set aside the conviction of the appellant under section 201, Indian Penal Code, and acquit her of that charge also.
Appeal allowed.
","In eases depending circumstantial evidence courts should safeguard themselves against the danger of basing _their conclusions suspicions howsoever strong.
Rex V. Hodge , and Nargundkar vs State of Madhya Pradesh (1952) S.C.R. 1091 referred to, 95 To establish a charge under section 201, Indian Penal Code, it is essential to prove that an offence has been committed (mere suspicion that it has been committed is not sufficient); that the accused knew or had reason to believe that such offence had been committed ; and that with the requisite knowledge and with the intent to screen the offender from legal punishment the accused caused the evidence thereof to disappear or gave false information respecting such offence knowing or having reason to believe the same to be, false.
Where the evidence showed that a person had died, that his body was found in &,trunk and was discovered in a well and that the accused took part in the disposal of the body but there was no evidence to show the cause of his death or the manner or circumstances in which it came about: Held, that the accused could not be convicted for an offence under section 201.
A statement that contains self exculpatory matter cannot amount to a confession, if the exculpatory matter is of some fact, which if true would negative the offence alleged to be confessed.
A confession must either admit in terms the offence or at any rate substantially all the facts that constitute the offence.
Narayanaswami vs Emperor (1939) 66 I.A. 66, referred to.
It is a well accepted rule regarding the use of confessions and admissions that these must either be accepted as a whole or rejected as a whole and that the court is not competent to accept only the inculpatory part while rejecting the exculpatory part as inherently incredible.

Where the statement made by the accused contained an admission that she had placed the dead body of her husband in a trunk and bad carried it in a jeep and thrown it into a well, but with regard to the cause of the death the statement made by her was that her husband bad accidently taken a poisonous substance which was meant for washing photos erroneously thinking it to be a medicine: Held, the statement read as a whole was exculpatory in character and the whole statement was inadmissible in evidence and the High Court acted erroneously in accepting the former part of it and rejecting the latter part as false.

Fazl Ali and Bose JJ.
delivered Judgment as follows: FAZL ALI J.
I agree that the acquittal of the respond ent should not be disturbed, and I also agree generally with the reasoning of my brother, Bose.
The question whether turmeric is foodstuff is not entirely free from difficulty.
In one sense, everything which enters into the composition of food so as to make it palatable may be described as 'foodstuff ', but that word is commonly used with reference only to those articles which are eaten for their nutritive value and which form the principal ingredients of cooked or uncooked meal, such as wheat, rice, meat, fish, milk, bread, butter, etc.
It seems to me desirable that the Act ShoUld be amended so as to expressly include 879 within the definition of the somewhat elastic expression ""foodstuff"" turmeric and such other condiments as the Legis lature intends to be treated as ' such for achieving the objects in its view.
BOSE J.
The question in this case is whether turmeric is a ""foodstuff"" within the meaning of clause 3 of the Spices (Forward Contracts Prohibition) Order, 1944, read with section 2 (a) of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, (Act XXIV of 1946).
The respondent was charged with having contravened clause 3 of the Order of 1944 because he entered into a forward contract in turmeric at Sangli on the 18th of March, 1950, in contravention of clause 3 of the Order.
He was convicted by the trial Court and sentenced to three months ' simple imprisonment together with a fine of Rs. 1,000 and in default, a further three months.
But he was acquitted on appeal by the Sessions Court.
An appeal to the High Court against the acquittal failed.
The State of Bombay appeals here but makes it plain that it does not want to take any further steps against the respondent in this matter but merely wants to have the question of law decided as a test case as the judgment of the Bombay High Court will have far reaching effects in the State of Bombay.
It will be necessary to trace the history of this legis lation.
In the year 1944 the then Central Government of India promulgated the Spices (Forward Contracts 'Prohibi tion) Order, 1944, under Rule 81 (2) of the Defence of India Rules.
Clauses 2 and 3 read together prohibited forward contracts in any of the ""spices"" specified in the first column of the schedule to that Order.
Among the articles listed in the schedule was turmeric.
The conviction is under that Order and it is admitted that if that Order is still valid the conviction would be good.
The Defence of India Act was due to expire on the 30th of September, 1946, and with it the Spices Order of 1944.
But before it expired an Ordinance called 114 880 the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Ordinance of 1946 was issued.
This was Ordinance No. XVII of 1946.
The object of the Ordinance, as set out in the preamble, was to provide for the control of what it called ""essential commod ities"".
It defined this to mean, among other things, ""foodstuffs"", and by a further definition ""foodstuffs"" was defined to include edible oilseeds and oils.
Neither spices in general nor turmeric in particular were mentioned.
Section 5 of this Ordinance embodied a saving clause which saved certain Orders which would otherwise have expired along with the Defence of India Rules.
The section ran as follows: ""Any order . made . under rule 81 (2) of the Defence of India Rules, in respect of any matters specified in section 3, which was in force immediately before the commencement of this Ordinance, shall, notwithstanding the expiration of the said Rules continue in force so far as consistent with th.is Ordinance and be deemed to be an order made under section 3.
"" The Ordinance was later replaced by the Act with which we are now concerned, the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act, 1946, (Act XXIV of 1946).
The Act merely repro duces the language of the Ordinance in all material particu lars and it is conceded that if the matter falls under the Ordinance it will also fall under the Act.
The appellant 's contention is that turmeric is a food stuff, therefore the Order of 1944 is saved.
The respond ent 's contention is that turmeric is not a foodstuff.
He contends that the Order of 1944 was limited to spices and.
that turmeric was included in the term by reason of a spe cial definition which specifically included it; and as the Act of 1946 and the Ordinance are limited to ""foodstUffs"" the Order of 1944 dealing with turmeric was not saved.
The question therefore is, is turmeric a ""foodstuff""? Much learned judicial thought has been expended upon this problem what is and what is not food and what is and what is not a foodstuff; and the only conclusion I can draw from a careful consideration of all 881 the available material is that the term ""foodstuff"" is ambiguous.
In one sense it has a narrow meaning and is limited to articles which are eaten as food for purposes of nutrition and nourishment and so would exclude condiments and spices such as yeast, salt, pepper, baking powder and turmeric.
In a wider sense, it includes everything that goes into the preparation of food proper (as understood in the narrow sense) to make it more palatable and digestible.
In my opinion, the problem posed cannot be answered in the abstract and must be viewed in relation to its.
background and context.
But before I dilate on this, I will examine the dictionary meaning of the words.
The Oxford English Dictionary defines ""foodstuff"" as follows: ""that which is taken into the system to maintain life and growth and to supply waste of tissue.
"" In Webster 's International Dictionary ""food"" is defined as: ""nutritive material absorbed or taken into the body of an organism which serves for purposes growth, work or repair and for the maintenance of the vital processes.
"" Then follows this explanation: ""Animals differ greatly from plants in their nutritive processes and require in addition to certain inorganic substances (water, salts etc.) and organic substances of unknown composition (vitamins) not ordinarily classed as foods (though absolutely indispensable to life and contained in greater or less quantities in the substances eaten) complex organic substances which fall into three principal groups, Proteins, Carbohydrates and Fats.
Next is given a special definition for legal purposes, namely ""As used in laws prohibiting adulteration etc.
, 'food ' is generally held to mean any article used as food or drink by man, whether simple, mixed or compound, including ad juncts such as condiments etc., and often excluding drugs and natural water.
"" 882 The definition given of ""foodstuff"" is 1.
Anything used as food.
Any substance of food value as protein, fat etc.
entering into the composition of a food.
"" It will be seen from these definitions that ""foodstuff"" has no special meaning of its own.
It merely carries us back to the definition of ""food"" because ""foodstuff"" is anything which is used as ""food"" So far as ""food"" is concerned, it can be used in a wide as well as a narrow sense and, in my opinion, much must depend upon the context and background.
Even in a popular sense, when one asks another, ""Have you had your food ? "", one means the composite preparations which normally go to constitute a meal curry and rice, sweetmeats, pudding, cooked vegetables and so forth.
One does not usually think separately of the different preparations which enter into their making, of the various condiments and spices and vitamins, any more than one would think of separating in his mind the purely nutritive elements of what is eaten from their non nutritive adjuncts.
So also, looked at from another point of view, the var ious adjuncts of what I may term food proper which enter into its preparation for human consumption in order to make it palatable and nutritive, can hardly be separated from the purely nutritive elements if the effect of their absence would be to render the particular commodity in its finished state unsavoury and indigestible to a whole class of persons whose stomachs are accustomed to a more spicely prepared product.
The proof of the pudding is, as it were, in the eating, and ii the effect of eating what would otherwise be palatable and digestible and therefore nutritive is to bring on indigestion to a stomach unaccustomed to to such unspiced fare, the answer must, I think, be that however nutritive a product may be in one form it can scarcely be classed as nutritive if the only result of eating it is to produce the opposite effect; and if the essence of the definition is the nutritive element, then the commodity in question must cease 883 to befood, within the strict meaning of the definition, to that particular class of persons, without the addition of the spices which make it nutritive."" Put more colloquially, ""one man 's food is another man 's poison.
"" I refer to this not for the sake of splitting hairs but to show the unde sirability of such a mode of approach.
The problem must, 1 think, be solved in a commonsense way.
I will now refer to the cases which were cited before us.
In The San Jose, Cometa and Salerno(1) sausage skins the envelope in which sausage meat is usually con tained were held to be foodstuffs.
But this was a case of conditional contraband captured during the war in pursuance of a war time measure, and the decision was given in accord ance with international law.
This does not appear from the judgment but is plain from an earlier judgment of the same learned President on which his later decision was based.
The earlier judgment is reported in The Kim(2).
He explains there at page 27 that the law of contraband is based on ""the right of a belligerent to prevent certain goods from reach ing the country of the enemy for his military use,"" and he states, also at page 27, that ""International law, in order to be adequate well as just, must have regard to the circumstances the times, including the circumstances arising out the particular situation of the war, or the condition the parties engaged in it."" One of the changing circumstances he felt he had to take into consideration is set out at page 29: ""The reason for drawing a distinction between foodstuffs intended for the civil population and those for the armed forces or enemy Government disappears when the distinction between the civil population and the armed forces itself disappears.
Experience shows that the power to requisition will be used to the fullest extent in order to make sure that the wants of the military are supplied, and however much goods may be im ported for civil use it is by the military that (1) (2) , 884 they will be consumed if military exigencies require it, especially now that the German Government have taken control of all the foodstuffs in the country.
"" It is understandable that viewed against a background like that, the word ""foodstuffs"" would be construed in its wider sense in order to give full effect to the object behind the law, namely the safety and preservation of the State.
It is also perhaps relevant to note that the term which was under consideration in those cases occurred in a war time measure, namely a Proclamation promulgated on the 4th of August, 1914, the day on which the first world war started.
There is authority for the view that war time measures, which often have to be enacted hastily to meet a grave pressing national emergency in which the very existence of the State is at stake, should be construed more liberally.
in favour of the Crown or the State than peace time legisla tion.
The only assistance I can derive from this case is that the term ""foodstuffs"" is wide enough to cover matter which would not normally fall within the definition of what I have called food proper.
I do not think it is helpful in deciding whether the wider or the narrower definition should be employed here because the circumstances and background are so different.
The next case to which I will refer is James vs Jones(1).
That was a case of baking powder and it was held that baking powder is an article of food within the meaning of the English Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1875.
Now it has to be observed here that the object of that Act was to prevent the adulteration of food with ingredients which are injurious to health.
It is evident that the definition would have to be wide so as to include not only foodstuffs strict ly so called but also ingredients which ultimately enter into its preparation, otherwise the purpose of the legisla tion, which was to conserve the health of the British peo ple, would have been defeated.
(1) 885 Next comes a case relating to tea in which a narrower view was taken: Hinde vs Allmond(1).
The question there was whether tea was an ""article of food"" within the meaning of an Order designed to prohibit the hoarding of food, namely the Food Hoarding Order of 1917.
The learned Judges held it was not.
But here it is necessary to note the background and at any rate some of the reasons given for the decision.
The prosecution there was directed against an ordinary housewife who had in her possession a quantity of tea which exceeded the quantity required for ordinary use and con sumption in her household.
The Food Hoarding Order did not specify tea or indeed any other article.
It merely prohib ited generally the hoarding of any ""article of food"" by requiring that no person should have in his possession or under his control at any one time more than the quantity required for use and consumption in his household or estab lishment.
Shearman J. said that he rested his judgment on the ""commonsense interpretation of the word 'food ' in the Order, apart from its meaning in any other statute"" and said : ""I agree with my brother Darling that if it had been intended to include tea as food, it ought to have been expressly so provided in the Order."" Darling J. explained what he meant in this case in a later decision, Sainsbury vs Saunders(2), and said that there was nothing to prevent the Food Controller from saying that a person should not have, for example, so much wine in his possession, provided he did not simply call it ""food"" and provided also that he let a person who was to be pun ished know what it was that he was not to do.
I think it is clear that the learned Judges were influ enced in their judgment by the fact that the Order in the earlier case was one which affected the ordinary run of householders and housewives who would not have lawyers at their elbows to advise them regarding their day to day marketing.
In the circumstances, they decided that the word should be given (1) (2) 886 its ordinary and popular meaning, otherwise many inno cent householders, who had no intention of breaking the law, would be trapped; and this seems to be the ratio decidendi in the decision of the Bombay High Court in Hublal Kamtapra sad vs Goel Bros. & Co. Ltd. (Appeal No. 14 of 1950) which is the decision virtually, though not directly, under appeal here, though the learned Judges also take into consideration two further facts, namely that the law should be construed in favour of the freedom of contracts and a penal enactment in favour of the subject.
The English decision about tea just cited is to be contrasted with another decision, also about tea, given a few months later in the same year: Sainsbury vs Saunders(1).
Two of the Judges, Darling and Avory, JJ.
were parties to the earlier decision; Salter J. was not.
He held that though tea had been held in the earlier case not to be a ""food"" for the purpose of the Food Hoarding Order of 1917, it was a ""food"" within the meaning of the expressions used in certain Defence of the Realm Regulations read with the New Ministries and Secretaries Act of ,1916 which empowered the Food Controller to regulate ""the food supply of the country"" and the ""supply and consumption and production of food."" Avory J. also considered that tea was an article of food for the purposes of these laws though Darling J. pre ferred to adhere to his earlier view.
All three Judges also held that the provisions were wide enough to enable the Food Controller to hit at articles which were not food at all, such as sacks and tin containers (Darling J.) so long as he was able by these means even indirectly to regulate the supply of ""food"", but that portion of the decision does not concern us here because the laws they were interpreting were more widely phrased.
Now the comparison of one Act with another is dangerous, especially when the Act used for comparison is an English Act and a war time measure, and I have no intention of falling into that error.
I am concerned here with the Act before me and must (1) 887 interpret its provisions uninfluenced by expressions, howev er similar, used in other Acts.
I have referred to the cases discussed above, not for purposes of comparison but to show that the terms ""food"" and ""foodstuffs"" can be used in both a wide and a narrow sense and that the circumstances and background can alone determine which is proper in any given case.
Turning to the Act with which we are concerned, it will be necessary again to advert to its history.
Rule 81 (2) was wide and all embracing and the Order of 1944 clearly fell within its ambit.
It is also relevant to note that one of the purposes of the Order, as disclosed in its preamble, was to ""maintain supplies essential to the life of the communi ty.
"" As turmeric was specifically included with certain other spices, it is clear that turmeric was then considered to be a commodity essential to the life of the community, that is to say.
it was considered an essential commodity and not merely a luxury which at a time of austerity could be dispensed with.
Then, when we turn to the Ordinance and the Act of 1946, we find from the preamble that the legislature considered that it was still necessary ""to provide for the continuance . of powers to control the production, supply and distribution of, and trade and commerce in, foodstuffs. ""Section 3 (1) of the Act continues this theme: ""The Central Government, so far as it appears to it to be necessary or expedient for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity, or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices, may by notified order provide for regulating or prohibiting the production, supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce therein.
"" The Ordinance is in the same terms.
Now I have no doubt that had the Central Government re promulgated the Order of 1944 in 1946 after the passing of either the Ordinance of the Act of 1946, the Order would have been good.
As we have seen, turmeric falls within the wider definition of ""food"" 1142 888 and ""foodstuffs"" given in a dictionary of international standing as well as in several English decisions.
It is, I think, as much a ""foodstuff"", in its wider meaning, as sausage, skins and baking powder and tea.
In the face of all that I. would find it difficult to hold that an article like turmeric cannot fall within the wider meaning of the term ""foodstuffs"".
Had the Order of 1944 not specified turmeric and had it merely prohibited forward contracts in ""foodstuffs"" I would have held, in line with the earlier tea case, that that is not a proper way of penalising a man for trading in an article which would not ordinarily be consid ered as a foodstuff.
But in the face of the order of 1944, which specifically includes turmeric, no one can complain that his attention was not drawn to the prohibition of trading in this particular commodity and if, in spite of that, he chooses to disregard the Order and test its validi ty in a court of law, he can hardly complain that he was trapped or taken unawares; whatever he may have thought he was at any rate placed on his guard.
As I see it, the test here is whether the Order of 1944 would have been a good order had it been repromulgated after the Ordinance of 1946.
In my opinion, it would, and from that it follows that it is saved by the saving clauses of the Ordinance and the Act.
I have already set out section 5 of the Ordinance.
In my opinion, the Order of 1944 falls within its purview, and ii it is saved by that, it is equally saved by section 17 (2) of the Act.
The section is in these terms: ""Any order . . deemed to be made under the said Ordinance and in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall continue in force and be deemed to be an order made under this Act.
"" In my opinion, the conviction was good and the High Court was wrong in setting it aside, but though the matter has no relevance here because of the undertaking given by the learned Solicitor General not to proceed against the respondent any further in this matter, I think it right to observe that.
the attitude of 889 the learned English Judges in the first tea case would not be without relevance on the question of sentence in many, cases of this kind.
There can, I think, be no doubt that businessmen who are not lawyers might well be misled into thinking that the Ordinance and the Act did not intend to keep the Order of 1944 alive because the Order related to certain specified spices while the Ordinance and the Act changed the nomenclature and limited themselves to ""food stuffs"", a term which, on a narrow view, would not include condiments and spices.
However, these observations are not relevant here because we are not asked to restore either the conviction or the sentence.
In view of that, there will be no further order and the acquittal will be left as it ' stands.
","The term ""foodstuff"" is ambiguous.
In one sense it has a narrow meaning and is limited to articles which are eaten as food for purposes of nutrition and nourishment and so would exclude condiments and spices such as yeast, salt, pepper, baking powder and turmeric.
In a wider sense it includes everything that goes toto the preparation of food proper (as understood in the narrow sense) to make it more palatable and digestible.
Whether the term is used in a particular statute in its wider or narrower sense cannot be answered in the abstract 878 but must be answered with due regard to the background and context.
Turmeric is a ""foodstuff"" within the meaning of cl.
(3) of the Spices (Forward Contract Prohibition) Order of 1944, read with s.2 (a)of the Essential Supplies (Temporary Powers) Act (XXIV of 1946).
The said order of 1944 falls within the purview of section 5 of Ordinance No. XVIII of 1946, which was later reenacted as Act XXIV of 1946, and it is equally saved by section 17 (2) of the Act.

October 24.
The Judgment of the Court was delivered by CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR J.
These appeals are connected and raise a common question of law.
They come before us on special leave granted by the Pepsu High Court at Patiala under sub clause (e) of clause (1) of article 133 of the Constitution, 754 The facts in Civil Appeal No. 152 of 1951 are different from those in the other two appeals, and the consequences are different also.
The proceedings arise out of the liquidation of two companies called the Marwari Chamber of Commerce Ltd., (in Civil Appeal No. 152 of 1951) and the Aggarwal Chamber of Commerce Ltd., (in the other two appeals).
The Official Liquidator settled the list of contributories, and after various steps taken before the Liquidation Judge of the High Court by way of objection on grounds of law as well as on merits, there were payment orders on 4th June, 1946, in Civil Appeal No. 152 of 1951 and on 18th January, 1949, in the latter two appeals.
The correctness and the validity of the payment order in Civil Appeal No. 152 of 1951 was challenged in appeals taken to the High Court by the Official Liquidator and the contributory.
The order of the Liquidation Judge was modified in favour of the Liquidator, and as against a sum of Rs. 4,762 13 3 ordered to be paid, there was an order for the payment of Rs. 24,005 7 3.
On further appeal by the contributory to the Judicial Committee, it was held that the appeal to the Division Bench was barred by time, and consequently the judgment of the Bench was set aside, and that of the Liquidation Judge restored.
This was on 6th December, 1949.
In the other two appeals, an application for removal of the name of the contributory was granted by the Liquidation Judge, but on appeal a Division Bench of the High Court reversed this order.
On further appeal taken by the company, the Judicial Committee, Patiala, remanded the case for retrial, and the Liquidation Judge made an order for payment of Rs. 8,191 0 9 on 18th January, 1949, as aforesaid.
On 2nd February, 1950, the firm Murari Lal Hari Ram, appellant in Civil Appeal No. 152 of 1951, filed an application under section 152, Civil Procedure Code, for amendment of the order of the Liquidation judge, Kartar Singh J., alleging that there was a 756 clerical or arithmetical error arising from an accidental slip or omission in that a sum of Rs. 24,005 7 3 was taken as due by the firm instead of the correct figure of Rs. 21,805 7 3.
This application was dismissed by the learned Judge on 16th March, 1950.
The firm applied to him for a certificate for leave to appeal, but this again was dismissed.
An appeal was preferred from the order dismissing the amendment petition, but it was thrown out on the ground of want of a certificate from the Single Judge.
This order is dated 1st May, 1950, and is couched in these, terms "" We have recently held in Ganpat Rai Hira Lal vs Aggarwal Chamber of Commerce, Ltd., L.P.A. Nos. 493 and 494 of Samvat 2005 (Pepsu) that no appeal lies from an order of a Single Bench to a Division Bench without a certificate by the Single Judge that the case is a fit one for further appeal.
In this case it is admitted that the appellants made an application for a certificate to the Single Bench, from whose decision he is appealing, but the same was refused.
The appeal is.
therefore not competent and is dismissed in limine.
"" The reference in the order to the case of Ganpat Rai Hira Lal vs Aggarwal Chamber of Commerce Ltd., L.P. A. Nos. 493 and 494 of Samvat 2005 (Pepsu) is to the order made by the High Court in the connected matter which has given rise to the two Appeals Nos. 167 and 167 A of 1951.
There, an appeal was lodged from the payment order of the Liquidation Judge, but it was dismissed on the same ground, namely, want of a certificate from the Single Judge.
In Civil Appeal No. 152 of 1951, the argument for the appellant is that no certificate front the Single Judge is necessary, as the matter is governed not by Ordinance X of 2005 of the Patiala State but by the Patiala States Judicature Farman Shahi, 1999 Bikarmi, under which no certificate is necessary.
It is true that under section 44 of the earlier Farman a certificate that the case is a fit one for appeal is required only if the judgment, decree, or order sought to be appealed is wade in the exercise of civil 98 756 appellate jurisdiction.
It is, however, clear that we are not governed by this provision.
The amendment application was made on 2nd February, 1950, as stated already.
No appeal is provided under the Civil Procedure Code from an order amending or refusing to amend a judgment, decree or order, though an appeal would lie from the amended decree or order.
There is no warrant for the view that the amendment petition is a continuation of the suit or proceedings therein.
It is in the nature of an independent proceeding, though connected with the order of which amendment is sought.
Such a proceeding is governed by the law prevailing on its date, which admittedly is Pepsu.
Ordinance X of 2005, and which provides in section 52 for a certificate.
The section is in the following terms: "" Subject to any other provision of law, an appeal shall lie to the High Court from a judgment, decree or order of one Judge of the High Court and shall be heard by a Bench consisting of two Judges of the High Court: Provided that no such appeal shall lie to the High Court unless the Judge who decides the case or in his absence the Chief Justice certifies that the case is a fit one for appeal. "" So far as the appellant firm is concerned, there is no question of any right of appeal vested in it which is sought to be taken away by giving retrospective effect to the Ordinance which came into force in August, 1948.
The order of the High Court holding that no appeal lies from an order of a single Judge without a certificate by him that the case is a fit one for appeal, is, in our opinion, right.
In the other two Appeals Nos. 167 and 167 A, of 1951, different considerations come into play.
The payment order of the Liquidation Judge was on 18th January, 1949, and the appeal was preferred on 19th February, 1949.
In the meantime, as there was some doubt on the question, the appellants took the precaution of applying to the Judge for a certificate, but this was dismissed on 3rd March, 1949.
On the relevant dates, the Patiala States Judicature Farman, 1999, was in force, and the appellants hood a, right of 757 appeal from the payment order without a certificates They could not be deprived of this right by a subsequent change in the law, unless the later enactment provides expressly or by necessary implication for retrospective effect being given.
The learned Judges of the High Court conceded this in their order, but they thought 'that section 116 of Ordinance X of 2005 (1948 49) contained an express provision to the contrary.
The section is in these terms: Notwithstanding anything contained in this Ordinance, all suits, appeals, revisions, applications, reviews, executions and other proceedings, or any of them, whether civil or criminal, pending in the Courts and before judicial authorities in any Covenanting State shall be continued and concluded respectively in Courts or before judicial authorities of the like status in the Union ; and the Courts or authorities in the Union shall have the same jurisdiction in respect, of all such suits, appeals, revisions, reviews, executions, applications and other proceedings, or any of them, as if the same had been duly commenced and continued in such Courts or before such authorities.
"" It is fairly obvious that this is a transitory regula tion, providing for a change over of proceedings from one set of Courts in the Covenanting State to others of like status in the Union and for their continuance etc.
in the latter Courts.
It does not say that the proceedings must be treated as having freshly commenced.
What is contemplated in the latter part of the section is a notional commencement, if such a term could be used.
The section obviously means that all rights which arose or are likely to arise in the future shall remain intact notwithstanding the new set up, and that they would be dealt with by the Union Courts in place of the Courts of the Covenanting State.
There is nothing in the section to justify the view that any taking away of a vested right of appeal retrospectively was intended.
The decision in Colonial Sugar Refining Co. vs Irving(1) clearly applies to the facts, and the order of the High Court that (1) 758 the appeals are not competent is, in our opinion, erroneous.
The result is that Appeal No. 152 of 1951 is dismissed with costs throughout, while Appeals Nos. 167 and 167A of 1951 are allowed with costs throughout.
Appeal No. 125 dismissed.

Under the Patiala States Judicature Farman of 1999 a certificate was necessary for an appeal to a Division Bench from an order of a single Judge of the Patiala High Court only in respect of judgments and orders made in the exercise of civil appellate jurisdiction.
Under the Pepsu Ordinance X of 2005 (1948 49) a certificate was necessary in all cases.
In Appeal No. 152 an application made on 2nd February, 1950, for amendment of an order made by a Liquidation Judge in 1946 was dismissed and an appeal from the order of dismissal to a Division Bench was dismissed on 1st May, 1950, for want of a certificate.

The judgment of Mehr Chand Mahajan, Mukherjea, Das and Chandrasekhara Aiyar, JJ.
was deliv ered by Das J. Patanjali Sastri delivered a separate dissenting judgment.
PATANJALI SASTRI C.J.
I regret I am unable to a gree with the reasoning and conclusion of my learned brother Das J. whose judgment I have had the advantage of reading.
The appellants were convicted and sentenced to death and varying terms of imprisonment by the Special Judge, Ahmeda bad, on charges of murder and other offences under the Indian Penal Code, the Arms Act and the Bombay Police Act.
The Special Judge was appointed by a notification issued under the Bombay Security Measures Act, 1947, (hereinafter referred to as the impugned Act) and on August 6, 1949, the State Government, in exercise of the powers conferred by section 12 of the impugned Act, directed the Special Judge to try the case of the appellants who were implicated in what was known as the Central Bank Robbery Case.
Charges were framed on January 13, 1950, without any preliminary enquiry and committal by a Magistrate which had been dis pensed with by the impugned Act, and seventeen witnesses for the prosecution were examined before January 26, 1950, when the Constitution came into force.
The proceedings continued, and after the examination of sixty witnesses in all, ended in the conviction of the appellants on March 13, 1950.
Separate appeals were preferred by the present appel lants to the High Court which, however, confirmed the con viction and sentence in each case.
An objection that the trial was illegal as the impugned Act was void under article 13 (1) of the Constitution, read with article 14, was over ruled on the ground that 713 those provisions had no retrospective operation and did not affect proceedings already started in the Court of the Special Judge.
the learned Judges followed the decision of a Special Bench of their own Court in In re Keshav Madbar Menon(1) which has since been affirmed by this Court in ; It is urged on behalf of the appellants that the deci sion relied on by the High Court is distinguishable and that the present case is governed by the decision of this Court in The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar(2) to the effect that section 5 of the Bengal Act (which is in identi cal terms with section 12 of the impugned Act) is discrimi natory and void in so far, a any rate, as it empowers the State Government to direc ""cases"" to be tried by a Special Court under a special procedure.
Accordingly, it was claimed that the Special Judge had no jurisdiction to try the appellant applying the special procedure prescribed by the impugned Act.
Granting, however, that section 12 of the impUgned Act must, in view of the decision in Anwar Ali Sarkar ' case (2), be held to be discriminatory and void in so far as it empow ers the State Government to refer individual cases to a Special Judge for trial, it does no seem to me to follow that the trial of the appellants which had validly started before the Special Judge who had been duly empowered to try the case, is vitiated by reason of the Constitution subse quently coming into force.
It is to be noted that the West Bengal case(2) was argued on the basis that article 12 of the Constitution was applicable to the proceeding from their inception, although the notification directing the trial of some of the persons accused in that case was issued on the day before the commencement of the Constitution.
The posi tion here is different The appellant 's case was sent to the Special Judge for trial by notification dated 6th August, 1949, and the Judge took cognisance of it, framed the charges and proceeded with the trial to a considerable extend before the commencement of the Constitution on 26th (1) (1950) 52 Born.

714 January, 1950.
There could be no question, therefore, of the appellants ' fundamental right under article 14 being in fringed up to that point, as it has been held by this Court in Keshavan Madhava Menon 's case(1) that the provisions of the Constitution relating to fundamental rights have no retrospective operation and do not affect a criminal prose cution commenced before the Constitution came into force.
On and after 26th January, 1950, the appellants, no doubt, had the right to the equal protection of the law; but, as has been repeatedly pointed out, that right only meant that the State, including the executive and the legis lature, should apply the same law, substantive and procedur al, to all persons alike in the same situation without discrimination.
It is said that after the commencement of the Constitution persons who commit the same offences with which the appellants stood charged would, according to Anwar All Sarkar 's case (2) not be liable to be tried by the Special Judge under the special procedure and, if so, the trial of the appellants, too, could not be continued by the Special Judge under such procedure after 26th January, 1950, because such of the departures from the normal procedure of trial under the Criminal Procedure Code as were applied to the appellants during the rest of their trial, being disad vantageous to them in some respects, involved discrimination against them.
It is, therefore, claimed that the continued application of such discriminatory procedure after the Constitution came into force rendered the trial and the resulting conviction illegal.
I am unable to agree.
In the first place, as already pointed out: equal protection of the laws postulates persons in the same situation and in the same circumstances claiming that the same law should be applied to them.
Can it be said that the appellants, whose trial by the Special Judge had been lawfully com menced and was pending at the commencement of the Constitu tion, were in the same situation with persons who committed the same offences after the Constitution came into (1) (2) ; 715 force ? It seems to me that the situation and circumstances are different in the two cases and no complaint of dis criminatory treatment by reason only of the trial having been continued under the special procedure can be sustained, even assuming that the ordinary procedure under the Crimi nal Procedure Code became applicable to the appellants on and after 26th January, 1950.
Such assumption, however, seems to be open to ques tion.
Section 1, sub section (2), of the Criminal Procedure Code enacts that ""Nothing herein contained shall affect . . any special jurisdiction or power con ferred or any special form of procedure prescribed, by any other law for the time being in force . .
The juris diction conferred on the Special Judge by the impugned Act, which, as pointed out already, was perfectly valid and fully operative down to the 26th ,January, 1950, thus remained unaffected and application to the appellants of the ordinary procedure prescribed by the Code was excluded.
It cannot, therefore, be said that on the 26th January, 1950.
the appellants were in a position to claim that they were enti tled to be tried under the ordinary procedure like those who committed the same offences after that date or who, having committed them before such date, had not been direct ed to be tried 'by the Special Judge.
It was said that sec tion 1 (2) of the Criminal Procedure ' Code pre supposes a valid law conferring a special juris diction or prescribing a special form of procedure and, inasmuch as such parts of the special procedure as could still be applied to trials continued after the commencement of the Constitution are void under article 13(1) read with article 14, section 1(2) of the Code could not stand in the way of the appellants being tried under the ordinary procedure.
This argument seems to me to beg the question.
It assumes that the special procedure is discriminatory and void to the extent to which it could have been applied to the trial of the appellants after 26th January, 1950.
But the assumption would not be valid unless the appellants could be tried 716 under the normal procedure after 26th January, 1950, in which case alone they could say ""Why not try us under the Code; why discriminate?"" But, having regard to section 1 (2) of the Code, the normal procedure would become applica ble only if the special procedure is excluded as being discriminatory and void.
The argument thus proceeds in a circle.
Again, it is difficult to see on what principle the jurisdiction of the Special Judge, validly created and exercised over the appellants ' case, could cease to continue on and after 26th January, 1950.
According to the appel lants ' contention.
the special procedure prescribed by the impugned Act became discriminatory and void after 26th Janu ary, 1950, and, therefore, inapplicable to what remained of their trial.
But, could this circumstance affect the compe tence of the Special Judge to try their case of which he had validly taken cognisance ? In Keshoram Poddar vs Nundo Lal Mullick(1) the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that the cessation of the jurisdiction of a Rent Control Tribunal after 31st March, 1924, over properties beyond a certain rental value did not affect its power to deal with a case after such cessation if the case was within its juris diction when it was filed and related to a period prior to such cessation.
Their Lordships observed: ""The application of the Act is when the parties begin to move under it.
This was done in the present case before March 1924.
The rest is merely the working out of the application"".
The position here seems to me to be closely analogous.
The Special Judge was competent to try the appellants ' case when the trial commenced before 26th January, 1950, and the impugned Act was validly applied to the case.
The rest was merely working out the application of the impugned Act.
I find it diffi cult to see why the competency of the Special Judge to try the case should cease after 26th January, 1950, any more than that of the Rent Control Tribunal to deal with a pend ing matter after 31st March, 1924, when its jurisdiction was restricted.
(1) (1927) 54.
I.A.152.
717 If, then, the jurisdiction of the Special Judge to continue the trial of the appellants remained unaffected by the advent of the Constitution, it would be impracticable for the Judge to switch the pending trials to a different procedure from 26th January, 1950, so as to give effect to the equal protection claims of under trial prisoners.
The impugned Act, for instance, enacts that ""Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code the trial of offences before a Special Judge shall not be by jury or with the aid of assessors"" (section 20).
The trials having been held so far without a jury or assessors as the case may be.
it would obviously be impossible in such cases to continue them after 26th January, 1950, with a jury or with the aid of asses sors, where such trials are required to be so conducted under the ordinary procedure.
Again, the impugned Act provides that no case shall be transferred from any Special Judge, a necessary consequence of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Special Judge and the special mode of proceeding prescribed for him.
If a right of transfer under section 526 of the Code were to be recognised as accruing after 26th January, 1950, to persons undergoing trial before the Spe cial Judge, the scheme of trial by Special Courts may well break down.
The alternative courses open to the Court would, therefore, seem to be either to hold that article 13(1), read with article 14, does not affect pending trials even in respect of procedural matters, as it has been held not to affect such trials in respect of substantive rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution in Keshavan Madhava Menon 's case(1), or to go back on that decision and give those provisions of the Constitution retrospective, effect.
I am clearly of opinion that the principle of the above said decision must rule the present case.
That principle has been stated thus: ""Article 13(1) cannot be read as obliterating the entire operation of the inconsistent laws, or to wipe them out altogether from the statute book, for, to do so will be to give them retrospec tive effect which, we have said, they do not possess.
Such laws exist for all past transactions and ,.for enforcing all (1) ; 718 rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Con stitution"", (Italics mine).
Indeed, the last few words are apt to cover the present case, though, as a party to that decision, I am sensible that we did not have in mind a case precisely like the one now before us.
But, it is well to remember that over fine distinctions sometimes lead to unsuspected traps.
In the foregoing discussion I have assumed that such departures from the normal procedure as were still applica ble to what remained of the appellants ' trial after the 26th January, 1950, were so materially prejudicial to them as to amount to a denial of the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of article 14 of the Constitution.
I am, however, by no means satisfied that that is the position.
One of these deviations relates to the recording of evi dence. '1 he SpeCial Judge is empowered to record only a memorandum of the substance of the evidence of each witness examined, whereas the Criminal Procedure Code requires the evidence to be recorded in full.
Another relates to the summoning of witnesses for the defence, the Special Judge being given a discretion to refuse to summon a witness ' 'if satisfied after examination of the accused that the evidence of such witness will not be material"" (section 13), while under section 257(1)of the Code the Magistrate has the discretion to refuse to summon witnesses if he considers that the application for the issue of process for compelling the attendance of any witness is made ""for the purpose of vexa tion or delay or for defeating the ends of justice"".
And lastly, the impugned Act provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to transfer any case from any Special Judge (section 18 (3)), whereas transfers under section 526 of the Code are allowed on certain specified grounds.
The more important departures from the procedure under the Code such as dispensation of preliminary enquiry and committal and the elimination of jury and assessors had already been applied, and validly applied, to the trial of the appellants before the Constitution came into force.
and there can be no ques tion of such departures vitiating the trial.
I am unable to regard the 719 procedural variations in the recording of evidence and the summoning of witnesses as so serious as to amount to a denial of the equal protection of the laws within the mean ing of article 14.
Even if the appellants were to be tried under the normal procedure of the Code after 26th January, 1950, the omission to record the evidence in full and the refusal to summon a witness in the circumstances mentioned in section 13 may well be regarded as mere irregularities curable under section 537 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
As regards transfer, it does not, as already pointed out, fit in with the scheme of trial before a Special Judge, and, unless any system of trials by Special Courts is to be condemned as violative of article 14 the decision of this Court in Kathi Raning Rawat vs The State of Saurashtra(1) shows that it can be validly instituted in appropriate circumstances a prohibition of transfer cannot be regarded as falling within the inhibition of article 14.
I have emphasised elsewhere, and I do so again, that in applying the dangerously wide and vague language of the equality clause to the concrete facts of life, a doctrinaire approach should be avoided.
In all the circumstances of this case, I do not feel impelled to set aside the trial and conviction of the appel lants and I accordingly dismiss the appeals.
DAs J.
These two appeals are from the judgment of a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court (Dixit and Shah JJ.) dated May 19, 1950, dismissing the appeals preferred by the appellants against the order made by Shri M.S. Patti on March 13, 1950, as the Special Judge appointed under the Bombay Public Security Measures Act, 1947, whereby he con victed and sentenced them to death and to different terms of imprisonment under the different charges.
The prosecution case is shortly as follows: On the morning of May 26, 1949, between the hours of 10 30 a.m. and 11 a.m. in the city of Ahmedabad the two appellants with another companion, after injuring, by gunshot, the driver and a peon of the Central (1) ; 720 Bank of India Ltd, forcibly removed motor van No.
BY 4388 belonging to the bank in which a large sum of money was being carried from its head office at Gandhi Road to its branch office at Maskati.
After abandoning the motor van at a distance of threefourths of a mile, the three gunmen forcibly took possession of the bicycles of some persons who were riding the same and continued their escape.
In course of their flight, they fired and injured several people.
Eventually, however, the two appellants were arrested by the police but their companion made good his escape.
The driver and the peon of the bank who had been injured succumbed to their injuries, one dying on the spot and the other in the hospital on the next day.
After investigation, the Ahmedabad Police, on July 19, 1949, submitted to the City Magistrate, Ahmedabad, two charge sheets Nos. 183 and 188 A against the two appellants and the then unknown absconder in respect of several of fences committed in course of the transaction that took place on May 26, 1949.
The charge sheet No. 183 was in respect of offences under sections 394, 397, 302, 307 read with section 84 of the Indian Penal Code, section 19 (e) of the Arms Act, and section 68 (1) of the Bombay District Police Act.
The charge sheet No. 183 A was in respect of offences punishable under sections 307, 392 read with sec tion 84 of the Indian Penal Code, section 19 (e) of the Arms Act and section 68 (1) of the Bombay District Police Act.
In each of these charge sheets there was appended a note to the effect that the District Superintendent of Police, Ahmedabad City, had requested the District Magistrate.
Ahmedabad, to move the Government of Bombay/or the constitu tion of a Special Court to hear the cases and that the said charge sheets might be transferred to the Special Court as and when one was so constituted.
In view of this note the City Magistrate did not hold any enquiry but only re manded the appellants.
By a Notification dated August 6, 1949, the Government of Bombay exercising its powers under section 10 ofthe Bombay Public Security Measures Act, 1947, 721 constituted a Special Court of criminal Jurisdiction for the Ahmedabad District and under section 11 of that Act appoint ed Shri M.S. Patil, District and Sessions Judge, Ahmedabad, as a Special Judge to preside over the Special Court.
By another Notification made on the same date, the Government of Bombay in exercise of powers conferred by section 12 the Act directed the Special Judge to try two particular cases, namely, the Postal Van dacoity case in which there were 9 accused and the Central Bank robbery with murder case in which the two appellants before us were the accused under the two charge sheets.
In view of the above Notification the City Magistrate, Ahmedabad, transferred the two cases against the appellants to the Court of the Special Judge and they came to be numbered as cases Nos. 2 and 3 respectively of 1949.
On December 31, 1949, the Government of Bombay directed that the trial of the appellants should be held by the Special Judge in the Ahmedabad Central Prison.
There was no order of committal by any Committing Magistrate nor was there any preliminary enquiry by the Special Judge.
On January 13, 1950, the Special Judge consolidated the two cases against the appellants with a view to holding a joint trial.
On the same day he framed five several charges, namely, four under different sections of the Indian Penal Code and one under section 19 (e) of the Indian Arms Act and section 68 (1)of the Bombay District Police Act.
On January 19, 1950, the 'first prosecution witness was examined and up to January 25, 1950, seventeen prosecution witnesses were examined.
The Constitution came into operation on January 26, 1930.
The hearing proceeded thereafter and the deposi tion of the last witness was recorded on February 9, 1950.
Altogether sixty two witnesses were examined.
The two appellants were examined under section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on February 10, 1950.
One handwriting expert was examined as a Court witness on February 13, 1950, and arguments for the prosecution commenced on the following day.
After the conclusion of the 722 arguments for the defence on February 23, 1950, the Special Judge delivered his judgment on March 13, 1950.
According to his findings both the appellants had committed eleven different offences punishable under several penal provisions of law as specified by him and he convicted both the appel lants of the said eleven offences and sentenced both of them to death under section 302/34, Indian Penal Code, and to transportation for life under section 307/34, Indian Penal Code, and to various terms of imprisonment under various other sections of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act and Bombay District Police Act.
The capital sentences were, of course, subject to the confirmation by the High Court.
Both the appellants appealed to the Bombay High Court.
The appeals along with the reference for the confirma tion of the sentences of death were heard together by Dixit and Shah JJ.
who by their judgments dated May 19, 1950, dismissed the appeals and confirmed the sentences of death.
The appellants applied to the High Court for certificates under articles 132 (1) and 134 (1) (c) of the Constitution to enable them to appeal to this Court.
The High Court (Bhagwati and Dixit JJ.), however, granted the appellants a certificate only under article 132 (1) but declined to issue any under article 134 (1) (c).
The appellants thereupon filed the present appeals pursuant to the certificate under article 132 (1).
A petition was filed before us under arti cle 132 (3) for leave to urge, as an additional ground, that the trial was vitiated by reason of misjoinder of charges.
No such ground was actually advanced before the High Court and as this Court did not think fit to permit the appellants to raise a new point at this stage it disallowed that peti tion.
Accordingly these appeals must be limited to attack ing the judgment of the High Court on the ground that a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution has been wrongly decided.
The only substantial question of law as to the interpre tation of the Constitution urged before us is that 723 the Bombay Public Safety Measures Act, 1947, or, at any rate, that part of section 12 of that Act which authorises the State government to direct specific ""cases"" to be tried by a Special Judge appointed under that Act, offends against the equal protection of law guaranteed by article 14 of the Constitution and is as such void under article 13 on the principle laid down by this Court in the cases of The State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar(1) and Kathi Raning Rawat vs The State of Saurashtra(2).
In order to appreciate the point in issue, it is necessary to consider in some detail the provisions of the impugned Act.
The Act came into force on March 23, 1947.
It was then instituted as ""An Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to public safety, maintenance of public order and the preservation of peace and tranquillity in the Province of Bombay"".
The preamble recited the expediency of consoli dating and amending the law relating to those several mat ters.
By section 9 (3) the Act was to remain in force for a period of three years.
The Act was amended by Bombay Act I of 1950 and, amongst other things, the words ""security of the State, maintenance of public order and maintenance of supplies and services essential to the community in the State of Bombay"" were substituted for the words ""public safety, maintenance of public order and the preservation of peace and tranquillity in the Province of Bombay"" occurring in the long title and preamble of the Act.
The word ""six"" was substituted for the word ""three"" in section 2(3).
The remaining sections of the Act are grouped under several heads.
Thus sections 3 (A1) to 5B are grouped under the heading ""Restrictions of movements etc.
"" A contravention of an order made under some of these sections is made an offence punishable as mentioned therein.
The subject of ""collective fines"" is dealt with under that heading in section 6. ""Control of. camps etc.
and uniforms"" are covered by sections 7 and 8, each of which makes a contra vention (1) ; (2) ; 94 724 of any order made under it an offence.
Section 9 prescribes whipping as a punishment for certain offences under certain Acts in addition to any other punishment to which the of fender may be liable under those Acts.
Section 9A is set down under the heading ""Control of Publications etc."" and section 9B under the heading ""Control of Commodities etc.
"" Each of those sections makes a contravention of any order made thereunder an offence punishable as provided therein.
Sections 10 to 20 which are collected under the heading ""Special Courts"" are material for the purposes of the point in issue before us and will have to be carefully noted.
The rest of the sections are set out under the headings ""Miscel laneous"" and ""Amendments to Acts"".
Turning to the group of sections under the heading ""Special Courts"", it will be noticed that section 10, like section 3 of the West Bengal (Special Courts) Act.
1950, and section 9 of the Saurashtra State Public Safety Measures Ordinance, 1948, authorises the government by notification in the Official Gazette to constitute Special.
Courts of criminal jurisdiction for such ' area as may be specified in the notification.
Section 11 which corresponds to section 4 of the West Bengal Act and section 10 of the Saurashtra Ordinance empowers the government to appoint as a Special Judge to preside over a Special Court any person possessing the requisite qualifications mentioned therein.
Section 12 is expressed in precisely the same terms in which section 5(1)of the West Bengal Act and section 11 of the Saurashtra Ordinance are ' expressed, namely: ""A Special Judge shall try such offences or class of offences or such cases or class of cases as the Provincial Government may, by general or special order in writing direct.
"" It will be noticed that the offences mentioned in the above section are not limited to offences created by this Act only but also cover offences under any other law, e.g, the Indian Penal Code, Section 13 runs thus 725 ""13.
(1) A Special Judge may take cognizance of of fences without the accused being committed to his Court for trial.
(2) A Special Judge shall ordinarily record a memoran dum only of the substance of the evidence of each witness examined, may refuse to summon any witness if satisfied after examination of the accused that the evidence of such witness will not be material and shall not be bound to adjourn any trial for any purpose unless such adjournment is, in his opinion, necessary in the interests of justice.
(3) In matters not coming within the scope of sub sections (1) and (2), the provisions of the Code, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of sections 10 to 20, shall apply to the proceedings of a Special Judge; and for the purposes of the said provisions, the Court of the Special Judge shall be deemed to be a Court of Session."" Under section 14 the Special Judge may in his discretion direct the evidence of a person who is not in a position to attend the Court to be recorded on commission.
Enhanced punishments are provided for certain offences by section 15 as follows: ""Notwithstanding anything contained in the Indian Penal Code, whoever commits an offence of attempt to murder may, in lieu of any punishment to which he is liable under the said Indian Penal Code, be punishable with death, and whoever commits an offence of voluntarily causing hurt by stabbing may.
in lieu of any punishment to which he is liable under the said Indian Penal Code, be punishable with death or transportation for life.
"" Section 16 authorises the Special Judge to pass any sentence authorised by law and section 17 prescribes a special rule of procedure for recovery of fines.
Section 18 gives a right of appeal to a person convicted on a trial held by a Special Judge within a period of fifteen days from 'the date of sentence and also empowers the High Court to call for the records of the proceedings of any 726 case tried by a Special Judge and in respect of such case exercise any of the powers conferred on a Court of appeal by sections 423, 426 and 428 of the Code.
Sub section (3) of section 18 runs thus: ""No Court shall have jurisdiction to transfer any case from any Special Judge or to make any order under section 491 of the Code in respect of any person triable by a Spe cial Judge or, save as herein otherwise provided, have jurisdiction of any kind in respect of proceedings of any Special Judge."" Thus the right to apply for transfer of the case and the right to apply for revision are denied to an accused who is tried by a Special Judge.
Ordinary law is, by section 19 made applicable in so far as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of sections 10 to 20.
Section 20 provides as follows : ""Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code, the trial of offences before a Special Judge shall not be by jury or with the aid of assessors.
"" Thus, besides providing for enhanced punishment and whipping the Act eliminates the committal proceedings [section 13 (1)], permits the Special Judge to record only a memorandum of the evidence, confers on him a larger power to refuse to summon a defence witness, than what is conferred on a Court by section 257(1) of the Code of Criminal Proce dure and also deprives the accused of his right to apply for a transfer or for revision.
That these departures from the ordinary law cause prejudice to persons subjected to the procedure prescribed by the Act cannot for a moment be denied.
This Court has, by its decisions in the State of West Bengal vs Artwar Ali Sarkar (supra) and in Kathi Raning Rawat v The State of Saurashtra (supra).
recognised that article 14 condemns discrimination not only by a sub stantive law but also by a law of procedure and that the procedure prescribed by the corresponding provisions in the West Bengal Special Courts Act and the Saurashtra Ordinance which introduced similar departures from the ordinary law of procedure constituted a discrimination 727 against persons tried by the Special Judge according to procedure prescribed by those pieces of legislation and finally that, in any event, section 5 (1) of the West Bengal Act and section 11 of the Saurashtra Ordinance, both of which corresponded to section 12 of the Bombay Public Secu rity Measures Act, in so far as they authorised the govern ment to direct specific and particular ""cases"" to be tried by the Special Judge, was unconstitutional and void.
In view of the departures from the ordinary law brought about by the Bombay Public Safety Measures Act, 1947, which are noted above, it cannot but be held, on a parity of reason ing, that at any rate section 12 of the Act, in so far as it authorises the Government to direct particular ""cases"" to be tried by a Special Judge, is also unconstitutional.
Learned Attorney General appearing for the State of Bombay does not controvert the legal position as discussed above but he points out that the offences were committed in May, 1949, that the Special Court was constituted and the Special Judge was appointed in August, 1949, and these ""cases"" were dir","Held, per MAHAJAN, MUKHERJEA, DAs and CHANDRASEKHARA AIYAR, JJ.
(PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. dissenting).
Section 12 of the Bombay Public Safety Measures Act, 1947, in so far, at any rate, as it authorises the Government to direct particular ""cases"" to be tried by a Special Judge appointed under the Act does not purport to proceed on any classifica tion and therefore contravenes article 14 of the Constitution and is void under article 13 on the principles laid down in the cases of State of West Bengal vs Anwar Ali Sarkar ([1952] S.C.R. 284) and Kathi Raning Rawat vs Tht State of Saurash tra ([1952] S.C.R. 435).
The appellants who were accused of having committed murder and other serious offences were directed by the Government of Bombay by an order made on the 6th August, 1949, to be tried under the Bombay Public Safety Measures Act by a Special Judge appointed under the Act, charges were framed against them on the 13th January, 1950, and they were convicted in March, 1950.
On appeal it was contended before the High Court that the trial and conviction were illegal as the Bombay Public Safety Measures Act was void under article 13 read with article 14of the Constitution which came into force on the 26th January, 1950, but the High Court held that as the proceedings against the accused had commenced before the Constitution, the provisions of articles 13 and 14 did not apply and the conviction was not illegal.
Held,by a majority, that although substantive rights and liabilities acquired or accrued before the date of the Constitution remain enforceable, it cannot be held that after that date, those rights or liabilities must be en forced under the particular procedure that was in force before that date, although it has since that date been repealed or come into conflict with the fundamental right to equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the 711 Constitution, as there is no vested right in procedure.
The fact of reference of ""cases"" to the Special Judge before the Constitution came into force has no reasonable relation to the objects sought to be achieved by the Act, the discrimi nation therefore continued after the Constitution came into force and such continuation of the application of the dis criminatory procedure to the cases of the appellants after the date of the Constitution constituted a breach of the fundamental right guaranteed by article 14, and the appellants were therefore entitled to be tried under the ordinary procedure after the date of the Constitution.
PATANJALI SASTRI C.J. (contra).
Granting that section 12 of the Bombay Act must, in view of the decision in Anwar Ali Sarkar 's case, be held to be discriminatory and void in so far as it empowers the State Government to refer individual cases to a Special Judge for trial, the trial of the appel lants which had validly started before the Special Judge who had been empowered to try the case cannot be vitiated by the Constitution subsequently coming into force.
The provisions of the Constitution relating to fundamental rights have no retrospective operation and do not affect a criminal prose cution commenced before the Constitution came into force.
The jurisdiction of the Special Judges validly created and exercised before the Constitution and their competence to try the cases referred to them cannot be affected by the special procedure becoming discriminatory.
The correct view is that article 14 does not affect pending trials even in matters of procedure.
Moreover the appellants against whom proceedings had been commenced before the Special Judge, were not in the same situation as others and there was nothing discriminatory in a law which permits them to be tried under the special procedure which was applicable to them when the proceedings were started against them.
